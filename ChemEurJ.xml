         <title>Three Perovskite Phases with Different Cation Orders in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation order, which can be controlled by synthesis conditions and stoichiometry, plays an important role in properties of perovskite materials. Here we show that aliovalent doping by Sb5+ in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 quadruple perovskite solid solutions can control cation orders in both A and B sites. Samples with 0.4 &#8804; x &#8804; 2 were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature method at 6 GPa and 1770 K. Three regions with different cation orders were found at 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0, x = 1.5&#8211;1.6, and x = 1.8. The 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0 compositions have a B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/nmc; the x = 1.5 and 1.6 samples have a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/n; the x = 1.8 sample has a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered structure with space group P21/n. All the samples show one ferrimagnetic transition: TC increases from 35 K to 73 K for 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0, TC = 81 K for x = 1.5 and 1.6, and TC = 53 K for x = 1.8.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Potential Drug Targets of Calix[4]arene by Reverse Docking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calixarenes are displaying great potential for the development of new drug delivery systems, diagnostic imaging, biosensing devices and inhibitors of biological processes. In particular, calixarene derivatives are able to interact with many different enzymes and function as inhibitors. By screening of the potential drug target database (PDTD) with a reverse docking procedure, we identify and discuss a selection of 100 proteins that interact strongly with calix[4]arene. We also discover that leucine (23.5%), isoleucine (11.3%), phenylalanines (11.3%) and valine (9.5%) are the most frequent binding residues followed by hydrophobic cysteines and methionines and aromatic histidines, tyrosines and tryptophanes. Top binders are peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptors that already&#160;are&#160;targeted by commercial drugs, demonstrating the practical interest in calix[4]arene. Nuclear receptors, potassium channel, several carrier proteins, a variety of cancer&#8208;related proteins and viral proteins are prominent in the list. It is concluded that calix[4]arene, which is characterized by facile access, well&#8208;defined conformational characteristics, and ease of functionalization at both the lower and higher rims, could be a potential lead compound for the development of enzyme inhibitors and theranostic platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenolysis of Cationic Half&#8208;Sandwich Zinc Complexes Containing a Chelating Amine: Facile Cleavage of Zinc&#8208;Carbon Bond by Dihydrogen To Give Zinc Hydride Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic half&#8208;sandwich zinc complexes containing chelating amines [Cp*Zn(Ln)][BAr4F] (2a, Cp* = &#951;3&#8208;C5Me5, Ln = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, TMEDA; 2b, Ln = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraethylethylenediamine, TEEDA; 2c, Cp* = &#951;1&#8208;C5Me5, Ln = N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyl&#173;diethylenetriamine, PMDTA; Ar4F = (3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4) reacted with dihydrogen (ca. 2 bar) in THF at 80 &#176;C to give molecular zinc hydride cations [(Ln)ZnH(thf)m][BAr4F] (3a,b, m = 1; 3c, m = 0) previously reported along with Cp*H.

         <title>CoPS/Co 4 S 3 Heterojunction&#160;with Highly Exposed Active Sites and Dual&#8208;site Synergy for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) has recently been recognized as a potentially effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there have been no research on the design of CoPS&#8208;based heterojunctions to boost their HER performance.&#160;Herein, CoPS/Co4S3&#160;heterojunction&#160;was&#160;prepared by phosphating treatment based on defect&#8208;rich flower&#8208;like Co1&#8208;xS precursors. The high specific surface area of nanopetals, together with the heterojunction structure with inhomogeneous strain, exposes more active sites in the catalyst.&#160;The electronic structure of the catalyst is reconfigured as a result of the interfacial interactions, which promote the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen and conduct electricity. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site&#160;further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70 mV&#160;to attain&#160;a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which renders it competitive with previously reported analogous&#160;catalysts. This work proposes an effective technique for constructing transition metal phosphosulfide heterojunctions, as well as the development of an efficient HER electrocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Induction in a Self&#8208;Assembled Pd4 Coordination Cage with Chiral Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of achiral precursors, cis&#8208;(tmen)Pd(NO3)2 and C2&#8208;symmetric ligand produces a racemic mixture of chiral octahedral cage. The cage encapsulates several hydrophobic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions with the aromatic walls. Intermolecular chiral induction has been achieved by encapsulation of enantiopure chiral guests within the cage resulting selective formation of a single homochiral assembly.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of coordination bonds within metal&#8208;organic cages offers a unique avenue for structural evolution in response to external stimuli, presenting a promising strategy for the construction of chiral assemblies. This adaptability is crucial for the selective synthesis of homochiral assemblies and advancement of asymmetric catalysis. In this study, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral square&#8208;planar Pd(II) acceptor with a C2&#8208;symmetric tetrapyridyl donor resulted in the formation of a racemic mixture of the chiral octahedral cage Pd4L2. The existence of this racemic mixture was confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We encoded chiral information into the asymmetric cavity of the cage by encapsulating chiral aromatic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media. The inclusion of a chiral guest induces a preference for one enantiomeric conformation of the cage over the other, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards a single, enantiopure host&#8208;guest complex. While the concept of chiral guest recognition by a chiral host is well&#8208;established, this work constitutes a remarkable example of guest&#8208;mediated chirality transfer leading to the formation of a single enantiopure coordination complex from achiral building blocks.

While the concept of chiral guest recognition by a chiral host is well-established, this work constitutes a remarkable example of guest-mediated chirality transfer leading to the formation of a single enantiopure coordination complex from achiral building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Uptake and Release of Semiochemicals in Channel&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Through Pore Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of Zr(IV)&#8208; and Al(III)&#8208;based MOFs containing sequentially expanded 1D&#8208;channel pores were investigated for the uptake and controlled release of semiochemicals. Through pore expansion, control over the degree of uptake and release dynamics of these biological messenger molecules was achieved, with the stability of these frameworks allowing for regeneration and re&#8208;use with near identical re&#8208;release profiles.







Abstract
Semiochemicals can be used to manipulate insect behaviour for sustainable pest management strategies, but their high volatility is a major issue for their practical implementation. Inclusion of these molecules within porous materials is a potential solution to this issue, as it can allow for a slower and more controlled release. In this work, we demonstrate that a series of Zr(IV) and Al(III) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with channel&#8208;type pores enable controlled release of three semiochemicals over 100&#8197;days by pore size design, with the uptake and rate of release highly dependent on the pore size. Insight from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations indicates that this is due to weaker MOF&#8208;guest interactions per guest molecule as the pore size increases. These MOFs are all stable post&#8208;release and can be reloaded to show near&#8208;identical re&#8208;release profiles. These results provide valuable insight on the diffusion behaviour of volatile guests in MOFs, and for the further development of porous materials for sustainable agriculture applications.

         <title>Enhancing Control Over Nitric Oxide Photorelease via a Molecular Keypad Lock</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular keypad lock based on a ruthenium nitrito complex allows for the double&#8208;secure release of the bioactive nitric oxide molecule. The sequential introduction of protons and light to the system results in the release of nitric oxide whose concentration is predicted using an artificial intelligence model.







Abstract
Based on Boolean logic, molecular keypad locks secure molecular information, typically with an optical output. Here we investigate a rare example of a molecular keypad lock with a chemical output. To this end, the light&#8208;activated release of biologically important nitric oxide from a ruthenium complex is studied, using proton concentration and photon flux as inputs. In a pH&#8208;dependent equilibrium, a nitritoruthenium(II) complex is turned into a nitrosylruthenium(II) complex, which releases nitric oxide under irradiation with visible light. The precise prediction of the output nitric oxide concentration as function of the pH and photon flux is achieved with an artificial intelligence approach, namely the adaptive neuro&#8208;fuzzy inference system. In this manner an exceptionally high level of control over the output concentration is obtained. Moreover, the provided concept to lock a chemical output as well as the output prediction may be applied to other (photo)release schemes.

         <title>Detection and Characterization of Hydride Ligands in Copper Complexes by Hard X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Discover how X&#8208;ray absorption and X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy analyses unveil insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydride complexes. The integration of experimental and theoretical approaches offers a holistic approach in detecting and characterizing hydride ligands in copper complexes.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes, particularly copper hydrides, play an important role in various catalytic processes and molecular inorganic chemistry. This study employs synchrotron hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to gain insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydrides as potential catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The potential of high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (HERFD&#8208;XANES) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission (VtC&#8208;XES) is demonstrated with measurement on Stryker's reagent (Cu6H6) and [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;H)(dpmppe)2](PF6)2 (Cu3H), alongside a non&#8208;hydride copper compound ICu(dtbppOH) (Cuy&#8722;I). The XANES analysis reveals that coordination geometries strongly influence the spectra, providing only indirect details about hydride coordination. The VtC&#8208;XES analysis exhibits a distinct signal around 8975&#8197;eV, offering a diagnostic tool to identify hydride ligands. Theoretical calculations support and extend these findings by comparing hydride&#8208;containing complexes with their hydride&#8208;free counterparts.

         <title>Hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 Encapsulated Pd Catalysts for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited satisfactory selectivity and stability in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFA) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) is regarded as attractive transformation to achieve the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass resources. However, the conventional supported catalysts are significantly restricted by their narrow pore size, ununiform dispersion and easy leaching or aggregation of catalytic sites. Herein, we designed hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as the support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) to achieve the highly active and selective conversion of FFA to FA. Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited 96.8&#8201;% conversion of FFA with satisfactory selectivity reaching up to 92.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C, 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 in isopropanol solvent within 6&#8197;h. More importantly, as&#8208;prepared Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 catalyst exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, as well as good universality toward a series of hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>Generation, Characterization and Reactivity of a High&#8208;Valent Mononuclear Cobalt(IV)&#8722;Diazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of azide to a Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex results in the replacement of both nitrate ligands to form a Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species. The azide interacts with Co(IV) more strongly than nitrate, leading to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the basicity of azide, Co(IV)&#8722;diazide has a higher driving force than Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate species to activate substrate C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent Fe(IV)=O intermediates of metalloenzymes have inspired numerous efforts to generate synthetic analogs to mimic and understand their substrate oxidation reactivities. However, high&#8208;valent M(IV) complexes of late transition metals are rare. We have recently reported a novel Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex (1&#8208;NO3) that activates sp3 C&#8722;H bonds up to 87&#8197;kcal/mol. In this work, we have shown that the nitrate ligands in 1&#8208;NO3 can be replaced by azide, a more basic coordinating base, resulting in the formation of a more potent Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species (1&#8208;N3) that reacts with substrates (hydrocarbons and phenols) at faster rate constants and activates stronger C&#8722;H bonds than the parent complex 1&#8208;NO3. We have characterized 1&#8208;N3 employing a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches. Our results clearly show that the coordination of azide leads to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the higher basicity of azide, these thermodynamic parameters contribute to the higher driving forces of 1&#8208;N3 than 1&#8208;NO3 for C&#8722;H bond activation. Our discoveries are thus insightful for designing more reactive bio&#8208;inspired high&#8208;valent late transition metal complexes for activating inert aliphatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Silver(i) Perfluoroalcoholates: Synthesis, Structure, and their Use as Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable fluorinated groups are an opportunity for the future, as ECHA is considering the regulation of persistent PFAS in the coming years. Therefore, the OCF3 group is emerging as a degradable group for a variety of applications, while higher perfluoroalkoxy groups are still of interest for agrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. The silver(I) perfluoroalcoholates can provide valuable reagents for incorporation into organic molecules.







Abstract
Herein we report a general access to silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates, their structure in the solid state and in solution, and their use as transfer reagents. The silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates are prepared by the reaction of AgF with the corresponding perfluorinated carbonyl compounds in acetonitrile and are stable for a prolonged time at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of perfluoroalcoholate species showed that two Ag(i) centers are bridged by the alcoholate ligands. In acetonitrile solution, Ag[OCF3] forms different structures as indicated by IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates can be used as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reagents for the synthesis of Cu[OCF3], Cu[OC2F5], [PPh4][Au(CF3)3(OCF3)], and fluorinated alkyl ethers.

         <title>Classification and Identification of Perfume Scents by an Enantioselective Colorimetric Sensor Array of Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Films</title>

         <dc:description>
A colorimetric sensor array made of Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot films based on different chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks is presented. The color changes as response to analyte vapor molecules. The sensors respond enantioselectively for chiral vapor molecules. In combination with a common smartphone camera, the sensor array is used as simple and cost&#8208;efficient system to detect and identify a large number of perfume samples.







Abstract
Many odors, like perfumes, are complex mixtures of chiral and achiral molecules where the cost&#8208;efficient (enantio&#8722;)selective sensing represents a major technical challenge. Here, we present a colorimetric sensor array of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (SURMOF) films in Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities. The optical properties of the FP&#8208;SURMOF films with different chiral and achiral structures are affected by the (enantio&#8722;)selective adsorption of the analytes in the SURMOF pores, resulting in different responses to the analyte molecules. The read&#8208;out of the sensor array is performed by the digital camera of a common smartphone, where the RGB values are determined. By analyzing the sensor array data with simple machine learning algorithms, the analytes are discriminated. After demonstrating the enantioselective response for a pair of pure chiral odor molecules, we apply the sensor array to detect and discriminate a large number (16) of common commercial perfumes and eau de toilettes. While our untrained human nose is not able to discriminate all perfumes, the presented colorimetric sensor array can classify all perfumes with great classification accuracy. Moreover, the sensor array was used to identify unlabeled samples correctly. We foresee such an FP&#8208;chiral&#8208;SURMOF&#8208;based sensor array as a powerful approach toward inexpensive selective odors sensing applications.

         <title>Effect of Co&#8208;Adsorbed Guest Adsorbates on the Separation of Ethylene/Ethane Mixtures on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Open Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR renders the direct determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in the presence of guest adsorbates (H2O, CO2 and O2) on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions in the ternary mixture systems were unraveled from 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation MAS&#8197;NMR and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments.







Abstract
Direct determination of the equilibrium adsorption and spectroscopic observation of adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction is crucial to evaluate the olefin/paraffin separation performance of porous adsorbents. However, the experimental characterization of competitive adsorption of various adsorbates at atomic&#8208;molecular level in the purification of multicomponent gas mixtures is challenging and rarely conducted. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is employed to examine the effect of co&#8208;adsorbed guest adsorbates on the separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. 1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR facilitates the determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in ternary mixtures. The co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2 significantly leads to the degradation of ethylene uptake and ethylene/ethane selectivity. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions are unraveled by 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments. The experimental results verify H2O coordinated on open metal sites can supply a new adsorption site for ethylene and ethane. The effects of guest adsorbates on the adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane mixtures are in the following order: H2O&gt;CO2&gt;O2. This work provides a direct approach for exploring the equilibrium adsorption and detailed separation mechanism of multicomponent gas mixtures using MOFs adsorbents.

         <title>A Triply Linked Copper(III) Dicarbacorrole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer was synthesized from a meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor via an oxidative fusion reaction. The dimer is capable of stabilizing high&#8208;valent Cu(III) cations and show distinct NIR absorptions.







Abstract
A triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer (7) was synthesized from a new meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor (6) via an oxidative fusion reaction by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 7 adopts a flat conformation with a length as ca. 15.946&#8197;&#197; and a width as 6.903&#8197;&#197;, which can be regarded as a short carbaporphyrinoid tape. Two coordinated Cu ions keeps the +3 oxidation state in 7, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is in sharp contrast to the Osuka's triply linked tetrapyrrolic corrole dimers, where the inner 3NH form is not stable and thus can only act as a divalent ligand. Due to the non&#8208;aromatic nature of dicarbacorrole macrocycle, the largely decreased HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of 7 are best ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between two dipyrromethene&#8208;type chromophores. To our knowledge, this is the first fully fused carbaporphyrinoid dimer with &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linkages prepared to date.

Herein, we describe B(C6F5)3/CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles with unactivated dienes to access chiral 10,10&#8208;difluoro&#8208;tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in good yields with good to excellent ee. The resulting cycloadducts containing an CF2 unit could be further transformed into other important building blocks.







Abstract
Here we report B(C6F5)3/CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles with unactivated dienes to access chiral 10,10&#8208;difluoro&#8208;tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles. This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities. Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the 10,10&#8208;difluoro&#8208;tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole skeleton was successfully achieved without any reduction in both yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Post&#8208;Formation of Fused Pentagonal Structure on Fjord Region of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) proceeds at lower temperature in water; mono&#8208;cyclization proceeds selectively in the fjord region of PAH to give CP&#8208;PAH products.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) via Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization in water, focusing on the formation of fused pentagonal rings within heavily fused PAH frameworks. Utilizing platinum catalysts at lower temperatures (200&#8208;260&#8201;&#176;C) in water, led to the successful synthesis of singly cyclized CP&#8208;PAHs. The reaction conditions facilitated the mono&#8208;cyclization of substrates such as dibenzo[g,p]chrysene and its isomers, yielding the desired products while suppressing the formation of bis&#8208;cyclized compounds. The use of Fe2O3 as an additive in conjunction with PtO2 was effective to suppress hydrogenation of the substrates and products. The products exhibited a redshift in UV&#8208;visible absorption and photoluminescence bands due to a decrease in the HOMO&#8722;LUMO energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization for the controlled synthesis of CP&#8208;PAHs, with implications for various applications in materials science.

         <title>Spectroscopy and Photochemistry of [Al, N, C, O, H]: Connectivity to Aluminium&#8208;Bearing Species in the Universe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Al&#8208;bearing molecules consisting of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] have been prepared and characterized in cryogenic argon matrix. The photochemistry of these candidate interstellar species, along with their dissociation reactions to the astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules, has been disclosed.







Abstract
Aluminium is one of the most abundant metals in the universe and impacts the evolution of various astrophysical environments. Currently detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules represent only a small fraction of the aluminium budget, suggesting that aluminium may reside in other species. AlO and AlOH molecules are abundant in the oxygen&#8208;rich supergiant stars such as VY Canis Majoris, a stellar molecular factory with 60+ molecules including the prebiotic NC&#8208;bearing species. Additional Al&#8208;bearing molecules with N, C, O, and H may form in O&#8208;rich environments with radiation&#8208;accelerated chemistry. Here, we present spectroscopic identification of novel aluminium&#8208;bearing molecules composed of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] from the reactions of Al atoms and HNCO in solid argon matrix, which are potential Al&#8208;bearing molecules in space. Photoinduced transformations among six [Al, N, C, O, H] isomers and three [Al, N, C, O] isomers, along with their dissociation reactions forming the known interstellar species, have been disclosed. These results provide new insight into the chemical network of astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing species in space.

         <title>Polymeric Nanozyme with SOD Activity Capable of Inhibiting Self&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Induced &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional polymeric nanozyme capable to strongly coordinate CuII is designed, generating complexes with a prominent superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, the combination of the polymeric platform with the chelator allows the nanozyme to perform its second activity: inhibition of both the self&#8208; and metal&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein peptides.







Abstract
Despite decades of research, Parkinson's disease is still an idiopathic pathology for which no cure has yet been found. This is partly explained by the multifactorial character of most neurodegenerative syndromes, whose generation involves multiple pathogenic factors. In Parkinson's disease, two of the most important ones are the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and oxidative stress. In this work, we address both issues by synthesizing a multifunctional nanozyme based on grafting a pyridinophane ligand that can strongly coordinate CuII, onto biodegradable PEGylated polyester nanoparticles. The resulting nanozyme exhibits remarkable superoxide dismutase activity together with the ability to inhibit the self&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into amyloid&#8208;type fibrils. Furthermore, the combination of the chelator and the polymer produces a cooperative effect whereby the resulting nanozyme can also halve CuII&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional polymeric nanozyme capable to strongly coordinate Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; is designed, generating complexes with a prominent superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, the combination of the polymeric platform with the chelator allows the nanozyme to perform its second activity: inhibition of both the self- and metal-induced aggregation of &#945;-synuclein peptides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, Parkinson's disease is still an idiopathic pathology for which no cure has yet been found. This is partly explained by the multifactorial character of most neurodegenerative syndromes, whose generation involves multiple pathogenic factors. In Parkinson's disease, two of the most important ones are the aggregation of &#945;-synuclein and oxidative stress. In this work, we address both issues by synthesizing a multifunctional nanozyme based on grafting a pyridinophane ligand that can strongly coordinate Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, onto biodegradable PEGylated polyester nanoparticles. The resulting nanozyme exhibits remarkable superoxide dismutase activity together with the ability to inhibit the self-induced aggregation of &#945;-synuclein into amyloid-type fibrils. Furthermore, the combination of the chelator and the polymer produces a cooperative effect whereby the resulting nanozyme can also halve Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-induced &#945;-synuclein aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor&#8208;Fullerene Oligo&#8208;Adducts for the Supramolecular Binding of Cyanuric Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a new concept for the regioselective synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor and cyanurate functionalized fullerene oligo&#8208;adducts. Based on an in&#8208;situ deprotection and click&#8208;post&#8208;functionalization approach up to twelve Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate moieties were attached to a suitable fullerene C60&#8208;based hexakis&#8208;adduct precursor. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated by synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate functionalized mono&#8208;adducts, which were unobtainable by direct Bingel cyclopropanation.







Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor and cyanurate&#8208;functionalized oligo adducts of the fullerene C60 was developed. Based on an in&#8208;situ deprotection and click&#8208;post&#8208;functionalization approach with novel azido precursors, the corresponding fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts with octahedral addition patterns and up to twelve Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate moieties surrounding the fullerene sphere were synthesized. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated by the synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate functionalized fullerene mono&#8208;adducts, which are not accessible by direct cyclopropanation. Several fullerene target compounds were purified by simple washing procedures of the solid crude reaction mixture without the need for chromatography. The resulting fullerene mono&#8208; and hexakis&#8208;adducts were fully characterized and their supramolecular properties were investigated by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

         <title>A Single Terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] Catalyst for Direct Julia&#8208;Type Olefination and &#945;&#8208;Alkylation Involving Sulfones and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] catalyst is employed for direct Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols and &#945;&#8208;alkylation of sulfones using different reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, are undertaken to gain insight on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
A terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] complex 1, supported by triflamide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligands, showed divergent reactivity for the reaction of sulfone with alcohol, contingent on base concentration, temperature, and time. Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols with sulfones was achieved using one equiv. of base, whereas lowering base loading to 0.5&#8197;equiv. afforded &#945;&#8208;alkylated sulfones. Besides excellent substrate scope and selectivity, biologically active stilbene derivatives DMU&#8208;212, pinosylvin, resveratrol, and piceatannol were synthesized in high yield under Julia&#8208;type olefination conditions. An extensive array of controlled experiments and DFT calculations provide valuable insight on the reaction pathway.

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Functionalized Anthracene Carboximides as Multivalent Ligands and Bio&#8208;Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbohydrate&#8208;conjugated anthracene carboximides (ACI glycosides) are synthesized which displayed excellent optical properties such as strong fluorescence, large Stokes shift in aq. solution, along with an increased aq. solubility. ACI glycosides show minimal cytotoxicity and are cell permeable as evidenced by the intracellular fluorescence. The glycosides self&#8208;assemble in aq. solutions, forming large vesicular structures and act as a multivalent glycocluster, showing specific lectin binding.







Abstract
Anthracene carboximides (ACIs) conjugated with gluco&#8208;, galacto&#8208; and mannopyranosides are synthesized, by glycosylation of N&#8208;hydroxyethylanthracene carboximide acceptor with glycosyl donors. Glycoconjugation of anthracene carboximide increases the aq. solubility by more than 3&#8208;fold. The glycoconjugates display red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, as compared to anthracene. Large Stokes shift (&#955;abs/&#955;em=445/525&#8197;nm) and high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;) of 0.86 and 0.5 occur in THF and water, respectively. The ACI&#8208;glycosides undergo facile photodimerization in aqueous solutions, leading to the formation of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer, as a mixture of syn and anti&#8208;isomers. Solution phase and solid&#8208;state characterizations by dynamic light scattering (DLS), microscopic imaging by atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopies reveal self&#8208;assembled vesicle structures of ACI glycosides. These self&#8208;assembled structures act as multivalent glycoclusters for ligand&#8208;specific lectin binding, as evidenced by the binding of Man&#8208;ACI to Con A, by fluorescence and turbidity assays. The conjugates do not show cellular cytotoxicity (IC50) till concentrations of 50&#8197;&#956;M with HeLa and HepG2&#8197;cell lines and are cell&#8208;permeable, showing strong fluorescence inside the cells. These properties enable the glycoconjugates to be used in cell imaging. The non&#8208;selective cellular uptake of the glycoconjugates suggests a passive diffusion through the membrane.

         <title>Energy Barriers and Gap Between Two Excited States in a Dual&#8208;Emissive Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barriers and gap between two excited states of a compound. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, the ratio of its LE and ICT emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures, and thus the energy barriers and gap between the two excited states can be experimentally estimated.







Abstract
A thorough understanding of the internal conversion process between excited states is important for the designing of ideal multiple&#8208;emissive materials. However, it is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barriers and gaps between the excited states of a compound. For a long time, it is dubious if what was measured is the energy gap or barrier between two excited states. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (2), which shows dual&#8208;emission in solution. Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence measurements show that the two emission bands in hexane are corresponding to two different excited states. The ratio of the emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures. Thus, the energy barrier and energy gaps between the two excited states of 2 can be experimentally estimated.

         <title>Tuning the Emission Properties of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzothiadiazoles via Regioselective Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective mono&#8208; and disubstitution of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) can result in long&#8208;lived fluorescence and overcome strong fluorescence quenching in polar protic solvents, addressing a limitation of many previously described BTD derivatives.







Abstract
The 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit is a prominent building block commonly used in various research areas such as optoelectronics and bioimaging. Despite its great versatility, the development of strategies to elaborate BTD has been largely neglected, including exploring its reactivity and understanding how regioselective functionalization can be used to tune the fluorescence emission. Previous focus has primarily been on C4&#8208; or C4,C7&#8208;substitutions. Here, a series of unsymmetrical mono &#8211; and disubstituted BTDs was synthesized and characterized for their photophysical properties. The reaction scope includes all six possible substituent patterns on the BTD benzoid ring (C4&#8208;, C5&#8208;, C4,C5&#8208;, C4,C6&#8208;, C4,C7&#8208; and C5,C6&#8208;substitution), which comprise arrangements that previously been synthetically challenging to access. By introducing a methoxy and/or a phenyl group we demonstrate that the emissive behavior of BTD derivatives strongly depends on the position of the substituent&#8197;(s). We show that regioselective substitution on BTD can engender long&#8208;lived fluorescence and circumvent strong fluorescence quenching in polar protic solvents, which is a limitation of many previously described BTD derivatives.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Cyclohepta[b]indoles and Cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;Indoline Conjugates via RCM, Hydrogenation, and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Expansion: A Biomimetic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient catalytic assembly for cyclohepta[b]indoles is achieved through sequential transformations: ring&#8208;closing metathesis, catalytic hydrogenation, and acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion. Ring closing metathesis (RCM) and hydrogenation of oxindoles yield spirocyclohexane&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles. A subsequent spontaneous ring expansion&#8208;aromatization sequence, catalyzed by either Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, results in cyclohepta[b]indoles or cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;indoline conjugates.







Abstract
Cyclohepta[b]indoles, prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals, are conventionally accessed via metal or Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cycloadditions with prefunctionalized substrates. Our study introduces an innovative sequential catalytic assembly for synthesizing cyclohepta[b]indoles from readily available isatin derivatives. The process involves three catalytic sequences: ring&#8208;closing metathesis, catalytic hydrogenation, and acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion. The RCM of 2,2&#8208;dialkene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles, formed by butenyl Grignard addition to 3&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, yields versatile spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole derivatives. These derivatives undergo further transformations, including dibromination, dihydroxylation, epoxidation, Wacker oxidation at the double bond. Hydrogenation of spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole yields spirocyclohexane&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles. Their subsequent acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion/aromatization, dependent on the acid catalyst, results in either cyclohepta[b]indoles or cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;indoline conjugates, adding a unique synthetic dimension. The utility of this methodology is exemplified through the synthesis of an A&#8208;FABP inhibitor, showcasing its potential in pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Nanomaterials for Activatable Photodiagnosis and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging, combined with activatable materials responsive to tumor microenvironments or external stimulation, reduces tissue scattering, allows deeper tissue penetration and enhances imaging resolution, thus improving tumor diagnosis and treatment. This review outlines recent advances in activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy, as well as addresses clinical hurdles and strategies for NIR&#8208;II phototherapy.







Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) spans wavelengths between 1,000 to 1,700 nanometers, featuring deep tissue penetration and reduced tissue scattering and absorption characteristics, providing robust support for cancer treatment and tumor imaging research. This review explores the utilization of activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy based on tumor microenvironments (e.&#8201;g., reactive oxygen species, pH, glutathione, hypoxia) and external stimulation (e.&#8201;g., laser, ultrasound, photothermal) for precise tumor treatment and imaging. Special emphasis is placed on the advancements and advantages of activatable NIR&#8208;II nanomedicines in novel therapeutic modalities like photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and photoacoustic imaging. This encompasses achieving deep tumor penetration, real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process, and obtaining high&#8208;resolution, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio images even at low material concentrations. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, the challenges faced by activatable NIR&#8208;II phototherapy are discussed, alongside potential strategies to overcome these hurdles.

         <title>Steric Effects on Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance in Flat&#8208;Lying Phenanthrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous results identified a 20&#8208;fold difference in conductance between phenanthrene derivatives with different anchoring group positions when measured upright between a gold surface and STM tip. This variation disappears when the phenanthrene derivatives lie flat between the tip and gold surface, all derivatives exhibit a conductance around 0.1 G0.







Abstract
A previous combined experimental and theoretical study found that the position of anchoring groups on a phenanthrene (PHE) backbone played a large role in determining the single&#8208;molecule conductance of the PHE derivative. However, a consistent 0.1 G0 feature was found across all PHE derivatives. To understand this, the previously investigated PHE derivatives were placed flat on a simulated Au substrate with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip over PHE and conductance was calculated using the non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function technique in conjunction with density functional theory (NEGF&#8208;DFT). The location of the tip was varied to find the most conductive and most energetically favorable arrangements, which did not coincide. Furthermore, the variation in conductance found in erect junctions was not present when PHE derivatives were lying flat, with all derivatives calculated to have conductance values around 0.1 G0.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light Regulated ATP Transport in Retinal&#8208;Modified Pillar[6]arene Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembled Sub&#8208;Nanochannel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural visible light&#8208;responsive protein channels, we have developed the visible light response of retinal modified pillar[6]arenes assembled sub&#8208;nanoscale channel to regulate ATP transport. With visible light irradiation, the isomerization of retinal induced the close of pillar[6]arene's channel to restrain the ATP transport. Without visible light irradiation, ATP can be selectively transported in sub&#8208;nanochannel. This result is better for understanding similar biological processes from the sub&#8208;nanoscale level.







Abstract
Natural light&#8208;responsive rhodopsins play a critical role in visual conversion, signal transduction, energy transmission, etc., which has aroused extensive interest in the past decade. Inspired by these gorgeous works of living beings, scientists have constructed various biomimetic light&#8208;responsive nanochannels to mimic the behaviors of rhodopsins. However, it is still challenging to build stimuli&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannels only regulated by visible light as the rhodopsins are always at the sub&#8208;nanometer level and regulated by visible light. Pillar[6]arenes have an open cavity of 6.7&#8197;&#197;, which can selectively recognize small organic molecules. They can be connected to ions of ammonium or carboxylate groups on the rims. Therefore, we designed and synthesized the amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived side chains of pillar[6]arenes with opposite charges. The sub&#8208;nanochannels were constructed through the electrostatic interaction of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived pillar[6]arenes. Then, the natural chromophore of the retinal with visible light&#8208;responsive performance was modified on the upper edge of the sub&#8208;nanochannel to realize the visible light switched on and off. Finally, we successfully constructed a visible light&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannel, providing a novel method for regulating the selective transport of energy&#8208;donating molecules of ATP.

         <title>Pyrene Functionalized Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Fluorescent Photoswitches: Characterization of their Spectral Properties and Application in Imaging of Amyloid Beta Plaques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study we synthesize and characterise two novel fluorescent norbornadiene derivatives bearing pyrene moieties. In depth spectral and physico&#8208;chemical characterisation is presented; moreover, their application as dyes for imaging of amyloid beta aggregates in Alzheimer's mice models is investigated, with implications for bioimaging and protein aggregate studies.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of two fluorescent norbornadiene (NBD) photoswitches, each incorporating two conjugated pyrene units. Expanding on the limited repertoire of reported photoswitchable fluorescent NBDs, we explore their properties with a focus on applications in bioimaging of amyloid beta (A&#946;) plaques. While the fluorescence emission of the NBD decreases upon photoisomerization, aligning with what has been previously reported, for the first time we observed luminescence after irradiation of the quadricyclane (QC) isomer. We deduce how the observed emission is induced by photoisomerization to the excited state of the parent isomer (NBD) which is then the emitting species. Thorough characterizations including NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence, X&#8208;ray structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems. Notably, one NBD&#8208;QC system exhibits exceptional durability. Additionally, these molecules serve as effective fluorescent stains targeting A&#946; plaques in&#8197;situ, with observed NBD/QC switching within the plaques. Molecular docking simulations explore NBD interactions with amyloid, unveiling novel binding modes. These insights mark a crucial advancement in the comprehension and design of future photochromic NBDs for bioimaging applications and beyond, emphasizing their potential in studying and addressing protein aggregates.

         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the spatial arrangement of materials at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale, patterning enable the exploitation of inherent material properties in novel ways, leading to the development of advanced devices and applications. This article highlights the significant contributions of spatially controlled patterning in chemistry, particularly in generating new functional properties and devices.







Abstract
Patterning offers an efficient way to quantitatively enhance and enlarge material properties and functionalities, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation in various scientific domains. By precisely controlling the spatial arrangement of materials at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale, patterning enables the exploitation of inherent material properties in novel ways. In addition, it generates new properties, leading to the development of advanced devices and applications. This article highlights the significant contributions of spatially controlled patterning in chemistry, particularly in generating new functional properties and devices, discussing some representative articles. Examples include the use of unconventional patterning techniques for surface functionalization, as well as the application of spatial confinement in improving material properties and controlling crystallization processes. Furthermore, the discussion extends to creating new devices, such as optical storage media and sensors, through spatial organization of materials.

         <title>Exploring the Magnetic Interactions in Two Novel Cyanide&#8208;Bridged Homo&#8208; and Heterometallic Hexadecanuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a prototype of the in&#8208;depth analysis of the origin of magnetic interactions in two novel hexadecanuclear discrete multivalent [Fe16] and heterometallic [Fe6Ni10] PBAs possessing low symmetry structures. Ab initio and BS&#8208;DFT calculations justify the magnetic behaviour caused due to the orthogonal arrangement of the interacting orbitals with a small contribution of the magnetic anisotropy.







Abstract
Two novel isostructural cyanide&#8208;bridged hexadecanuclear complexes with the general formula {[Fe(CN)6]6[M{en(Bn)py}]10}2+ [M=Fe (12+), Ni (22+)] have been synthesized. The structural analyses disclose the presence of multivalent Fe centres with different spin states in complex 12+ whereas all the Fe centres share a conserved oxidation state in complex 22+. The DC magnetic study revealed antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent metal centres and ferrimagnetic behaviour in 12+. On the other hand, ferromagnetic interactions were observed in complex 22+ due to nearly orthogonal orientation of the interacting orbitals and poor spatial overlap as observed in BS&#8208;DFT calculations.

         <title>U(V) stabilization via aliovalent incorporation of Ln(III) into oxo&#8208;salt framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentavalent uranium compounds are key components of uranium&#8216;s redox chemistry and play important roles in environmental transport. Despite this, well&#8208;characterized U(V) compounds are scarce primarily because of their instability with respect to disproportionation to U(IV) and U(VI). In this work, we provide an alternate route to incorporation of U(V) into a crystalline lattice where different oxidation states of uranium can be stabilized through the incorporation of secondary cations with different sizes and charges. We show that iriginite&#8208;based crystalline layers allow for systematically replacing U(VI) with U(V) through aliovalent substitution of 2+ alkaline&#8208;earth or 3+ rare&#8208;earth cations as dopant ions under high&#8208;temperature conditions, specifically Ca(UVIO2)W4O14 and Ln(UVO2)W4O14 (Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb). Evidence for the existence of U(V) and U(VI) is supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorption spectroscopy. In contrast with other reported U(V) materials, the U(V) single crystals obtained using this route are relatively large (several centimeters) and easily reproducible, and thus provide a substantial improvement in the facile synthesis and stabilization of U(V).</dc:description>

         <title>Can Aromaticity be Evaluated Using Atomic Partitions based on the Hilbert&#8208;space?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry that explains the stability and reactivity of many compounds by identifying atoms within a molecule that form an aromatic ring. Reliable aromaticity indices focus on electron delocalization and depend on atomic partitions, which give rise to the concept of an atom&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;molecule&#160;(AIM). Real&#8208;space atomic partitions present two important drawbacks: a high computational cost and numerical errors, limiting aromaticity measures to medium&#8208;sized molecules with rings up to 12 atoms. This restriction hinders the study of large conjugated systems like porphyrins and nanorings. On the other hand, traditional Hilbert&#8208;space schemes are free of the latter limitations but can be unreliable for the large basis sets required in modern computational chemistry. This paper explores AIMs based on three robust Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8208;&#8208;meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, Natural Atomic Orbitals (NAO), and Intrinsic Atomic Orbitals (IAO)&#8208;&#8208;&#160;which combine the advantages of real&#8208;space partitions without their disadvantages. These partitions can effectively replace real&#8208;space AIMs for evaluating the aromatic character. For the first time, we report multicenter index (MCI) and \iring values for large rings and introduce ESIpy, an open&#8208;source Python code for aromaticity analysis in large conjugated rings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Type of Stable Amides Behaves as Acyl Transfer Reagents upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation through&#160;Self&#8208;aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules with light&#8208;modifiable reactivity are important in many fields because they can serve as the &#8220;switch&#8221; for light to trigger chemical processes. Herein, we disclose a new type of stable non&#8208;twisted amides, the reactivity of which can be turned on by light as acyl transfer reagents. Upon photo&#8208;activation, these amides react with various nucleophiles including amines, phenols, hydroxide, thiols, boronic acids, and alkynes either under metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reactivity hinges on the design and synthesis of a photo&#8208;activatable reagent (7&#8208;nitro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrophenanthridine), which undergoes self&#8208;aromatization enabled by an internal oxidant under light. This masked acyl donor group is anticipated to be useful in scenarios where light is preferred to trigger a chemical process.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Radicals Featuring B&#8208; and N&#8208;Embedded Dioxygen&#8208;Bridged Units: Synthesis, Structures, and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tris(2,4,6trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) group has been widely used for constructing organic radicals, but the poor optical stabilities limit the application prospects of the TTM radicals. In this work, the rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged (BO and NO) units were attached to the TTM skeleton as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups, respectively. The rigidity and strong electronic effect of the BO and NO units contribute to the high chemical and optical stability of BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM radicals. Notably, NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55 nm (100 meV), while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635 nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43 nm (130 meV). This study has developed a methodology to produce highly efficient and enduring luminescent radicals, which could tune emission properties such as wavelength and FWHM.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Extended Aromatic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8209;Conjugated materials are highly attractive owing to their unique optical and electronic properties. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a great opportunity for precise arrangement of building units in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline matrix and tuning of the properties through choice of functionalities or post&#8208;synthetic modification. With this review, we aim at summarizing both the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs. We give examples of direct synthesis methods with large, &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks. COFs featuring fully conjugated linkages such as vinylene, pyrazine, and azole are discussed. Then, post&#8208;synthetic modification methods that result in the extension of the COF p&#8208;system are reviewed. Throughout, mechanistic insights are presented when available. In the context of their utilization as film devices, we conduct a concise survey of the prominent COF layer deposition techniques reported and their aptness for the deposition of fused aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of CO2 Activation: Insights into Metal&#8208;Metal Cooperativity and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling with {3d&#8211;4f} Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 into useful chemicals using metal catalysts is a significant challenge in chemistry. Among the various catalysts reported, transition metal lanthanide hybrid {3d&#8208;4f} complexes stand out for their superior efficiency and site selectivity. However, unlike transition metal catalysts, understanding the origin of this efficiency in lanthanides poses a challenge due to their orbital degeneracy, rendering the application of DFT methods ineffective. In this study, we employed a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations to explore the mechanism of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate using a 3d&#8208;4f heterometallic catalyst for the first time. This work unveils the importance of 3d and 4f metal cooperativity and the role of individual spin&#8208;orbit states in dictating the overall efficiency of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis and Recovery of Single Crystals of the Metastable Manganese Carbide, MnCx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal carbides find widespread use throughout industry due to their high strength and resilience under extreme conditions. However, they remain largely limited to compounds formed from the early d&#8208;block elements, since the mid&#8208;to&#8208;late transition metals do not form thermodynamically stable carbides. We report here the high&#8208;pressure bulk synthesis of large single crystals of a novel metastable manganese carbide compound,MnCxP63/mmc, which adopts the anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type structure with significant substoichiometry at the carbon sites. We demonstrate how synthesis pressure modulates the carbon loading, with~40% occupancy being achieved at 9.9 GPa.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved access to potent anticancer tubulysins and linker&#8208;functionalized payloads via an all&#8208;on&#8208;resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tubulysins are among the most recent antimitotic compounds to enter into antibody/peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC/PDC) development. Thus far, the design of the most promising tubulysin payloads relied on simplifying their structures, e.g., by using small tertiary amide N&#8208;substituents (Me, Et, Pr) on tubuvaline residue. Cumbersome solution&#8208;phase approaches are typically used for both syntheses and functionalization with cleavable linkers. p&#8208;Aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium (PABQ) linkers were a remarkable advancement for targeted delivery, but the procedures to incorporate them into tubulysins are only of moderate efficiency. Here we describe a novel all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy permitting a loss&#8208;free resin linkage and an improved access to super potent tubulysin analogs showing close resemblance to the natural compounds. For the first time, a protocol enables the integration of on&#8208;resin tubulysin derivatization with, e.g., a maleimido&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PABQ linker, which is a notable progress for the payload&#8208;PABQ&#8208;linker technology. The strategy also allows tubulysin diversification of the internal amide N&#8208;substituent, thus enabling to screen a tubulysin library for the discovery of new potent analogs. This work provides ADC/PDC developers with new tools for both rapid access to new derivatives and easier linker&#8208;attachment and functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole C5&#8208;Selective Bromination of Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine Alkaloids via In Situ&#8208;Generated Indoline Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PyH and HCl in MeOH is disclosed. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. These simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions are suitable for late&#8208;stage chemical conversions in total synthesis and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
There are many indole alkaloids that contain diverse functional groups attached to the benzene ring on the indole core. Promising biological activities of these alkaloids have been reported. Herein, we report the indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PyH and HCl in MeOH. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. Data support the intermediacy of a C3&#8208;, C5&#8208;dibrominated indolenine intermediate as a brominating agent. These conditions demonstrate excellent selectivity for indole C5 bromination of natural products and their derivatives. Thus, these simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions allow for selective, late&#8208;stage bromination followed by further chemical modifications. The utility of the brominated product prepared from naturally occurring yohimbine was demonstrated through various derivatizations, including a bioinspired heterodimerization reaction.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Decarboxylation of Proline&#8208;Derived Building Blocks for Protein&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a set of conformationally restricted Proline&#8208;derived Modules (ProMs), our group has recently succeeded in developing inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator&#8208;stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain, which is a key mediator of cell migration and plays an important role in tumor metastasis. While these (formally) pentapeptidic compounds show nanomolecular binding affinities towards EVH1, their drug&#8208;like properties and cell permea&#173;bility need to be further optimized before they can be clinically tested as therapeutic agents against metastasis. In this study, we sought to improve these properties by removing the C&#8208;terminal carboxylic acid function of our peptoids, either by late&#8208;stage decarboxylation or by direct synthesis. For late&#8208;stage decarboxy&#173;lation of ProM&#8208;like systems, a method for reductive halo decarboxylation was optimized and applied to several proline&#8208;derived substrates. In this way, a series of new decarboxy ProMs suitable as building blocks for decarboxy EVH1 inhibitors were obtained. In addition, we incorporated decarboxy&#8208;ProM&#8208;1 into the penta&#173;peptide&#8208;like compound Ac[2&#8208;Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][Decarb&#8208;ProM&#8208;1], which showed similar affinity towards EVH1 as the methyl ester derivative (Ac[2&#8208;Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][ProM1]OMe). However, despite better calculated drug&#8208;like properties, this compound did not inhibit chemotaxis in a cellular assay.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a method for the synthesis of various 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;ones that exploits the specific reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene framework, which is generated under silylating reaction conditions from a 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione bearing the picolinoyloxy group at the 2' position of its C&#8208;2 side chain. Our reaction system generates a carbocation via the release of the acyloxy group, forms a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton via the intramolecular attack at the resulting carbocation by a silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbon in the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene moiety, and induces the skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core. This novel transformation of a 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione moiety can be developed for the synthesis of other bicyclic frameworks fused to cyclopentenones.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides and Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides, and Egregiachlorides are synthesized in living organisms via the lipoxygenase&#8208;mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Originally isolated and identified from brown seaweed (Ecklonia stolonifera, Eisenia bicyclis, and Egregia menziesii), and later replicated on milligram scale through chemical synthesis, the full biological activities of these compounds remain to be elucidated. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we propose a unified methodology to synthesize the 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic structures of Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides and analogs using a versatile and convergent approach. This study delineates the synthesis of Ecklonialactone A, B, C, D, and Eiseniachlorides A and B, as well as ent&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B and 12,13&#8208;diepi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B.</dc:description>

         <title>Homochiral and Heterochiral Self&#8208;Sorting Assemblies of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems have received considerable attention because they&#160;can exhibit stacked&#8208;ring aromaticity&#160;due to&#160;substantial intermolecular orbital interactions. Here, we report three antiaromatic norcorrole dimers that self&#8208;assemble to form supramolecular architectures through chiral self&#8208;sorting. A&#160;2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimer&#160;with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups forms a&#160;&#960;&#8208;stacked dimer both in solid and solution states&#160;via homochiral self&#8208;sorting. Its association constant in solution is&#160;(3.6 &#177; 1.7) &#215; 105&#160;M&#8211;1&#160;at 20 &#176;C. In the solid state,&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimers&#160;with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic&#160;&#960;&#8208;systems.</dc:description>

Its association constant in solution is&#160;(3.6 &#177; 1.7) &#215; 105&#160;M&#8211;1&#160;at 20 &#176;C. In the solid state,&#160;3,3&#8217;-linked norcorrole dimers&#160;with 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self-sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self-sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic&#160;&#960;-systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helicene Appended Benzothiadiazoles as Chiral Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A homologous series of 4,7&#8208;bis(aryl) substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) compounds, containing the helicenic derivatives bis([4]helicene), bis([5]helicene) and bis([6]helicene), have been prepared upon a double Suzuki coupling between 3,6&#8208;bis(pinacolyl&#8208;borane)&#8208;BTD and the corresponding bromo&#8208;aryl precursors. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the bis([4]helicene) compound shows the existence of both helicities (M) and (P) on the same molecule. All the compounds of the series are highly emissive in solution, with quantum yields of the emission ranging from 50 to 91%. The enantiopure compounds (M,M) and (P,P) for the BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene) have been prepared from the corresponding enantiopure 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;[6]helicene precursors. Their chiroptical properties have been investigated in correlation with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which allowed to confidently assign the absolute configuration of the helicene arms and to characterize the different electronic transitions, including the low energy charge transfer excitation from helicenes to BTD. The enantiomerically pure fluorophores (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene), which exist in solution as two main conformers, according to the DFT calculations, show CPL activity in solution, with glum factors of &#8776; 1.7&#215;10&#8211;3 at lem = 525 nm, and also in the solid state, with glum factors of &#8776; 1.2&#215;10&#8211;3 in spite of the strong decrease of the quantum efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Fe/KB composite as sulfur host for Li&#8208;S battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium sulfur battery is a novel kind of secondary battery which has high energy density, however its application is greatly affected by the shuttle effect of polysulfides generated in the redox reaction of cathode electrode. Metal active sites are supposed as effective catalysts which can absorb and accelerate the conversion efficiency of&#160;lithium polysulfides, thus the shuttle effect will be alleviated. In this work, we conducted a simple way to prepare a metal Fe doped ketjen black to serve as the sulfur host of lithium sulfur battery. Ketjen black has a large specific surface area and rich porous structure, while Fe nanodot is an excellent catalyst for lithium polysulfides. Because of these advantages, the Fe/KB host can effectively confine a large amount of active material and accelerate its, therefore the Fe/KB&#8208;S cathode electrode show an excellent electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Biomolecules containing adenosine di&#8208; or triphosphate (ADP or ATP) are crucial for diverse biological processes. Synthesis of these biomolecules and development of their chemical probes are important to elucidate their functions. Enabling reproducible and high&#8208;yielding access to these ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules via conventional P(III)&#8211;P(V) and P(V)&#8211;P(V) coupling reactions is challenging owing to water content in highly polar phosphate&#8208;containing substrates. Herein, we report an efficient and reliable method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8211;P(V) coupling reaction through in situ activation of phosphates using hydrolysis&#8208;stable 2&#8208;[N&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazoyl)]&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (2&#8208;MeImIm&#8208;Cl), providing the corresponding electrophilic P(V) intermediates for subsequent nucleophilic attack using their coupling partners. This P(V)&#8211;P(V) coupling reaction proceeded even in a wet reaction medium and showed a broad substrate scope, accommodating protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of ADP&#8208;ribose&#160;and nicotinamide adenine diphosphate&#160;analogs, ATP&#8208;containing biomolecules, and ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Styrylbenzazole Photoswitches and Evaluation of their Photochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrylbenzazoles form a promising yet under&#8208;represented class of photoswitches that can perform a light&#8208;driven E&#8208;Z isomerization of the central alkene double bond without undergoing irreversible photocyclization, typical of the parent stilbene. In this work, we report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches. Their thermal stabilities, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelengths and photostationary state (PSS) distributions can be tuned by changing the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring. In particular, we found that push&#8208;pull systems show large redshifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths and the highest quantum yields, whereas ortho&#8208;substituted styrylbenzazole photoswitches exhibit the most favorable PSS ratios. Taking advantage of both design principles, we produced 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;styrylbenzothiazole, a thermally stable and efficient P&#8208;type photoswitch which displays negative photochromism upon irradiation with visible light up to 470 nm to obtain a near&#8208;quantitative isomerization with a very high quantum yield of 59%. Furthermore, 4&#8208;hydroxystyrylbenzothiazole was demonstrated to be a pH&#8208;sensitive switch which exhibits a 100 nm redshift upon deprotonation. Ortho&#8208;methylation of this switch improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from E:Z=53:47 to E:Z=18:82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.</dc:description>

In these reactions the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2] was reacted with CuX (X = Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X = Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu2 ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.</dc:description>

Using solid state molecular structures, photophysical data, cyclic voltammetry, DFT and LR&#8208;TDDFT calculations, we compare o&#8208;carborane and B(mes)2 (mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) as acceptor groups. Whereas the &#960;&#8208;acceptor strength of B(mes)2 is sufficient to drop the pyrene LUMO+1 below the LUMO, the carborane does not do this. We confirm the &#960;&#8208;donor strength of the julolidine&#8208;like moiety, however, which raises the pyrene HOMO&#8208;1 above the HOMO.

         <title>Activation of SO2F2 at a Rhodium PNP Pincer Complex: Ligand Supported S&#8208;F Bond Cleavage to Generate NSO2F Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;phosphine ligand precursor NH(CH2CH2PCy2)2 can be used for the synthesis of the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4NHC2H4PCy2}][Cl] (1). The deprotonated complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4NC2H4PCy2}] (2) shows a cooperative reactivity of the PNP ligand in the activation reaction of SO2F2 to yield the rhodium fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (3) by S&#8208;F bond cleavage. It is remarkable that no reaction was observed when 3 was treated with hydrogen sources e.g. dihydrogen, organosilicon compounds such as triethylsilane or TMS&#8208;CF3 and different fluorine sources such as SF4 or Selectfluor&#174;. However, the treatment of complex 3 with XeF2 in the presence of CsF resulted in the formation of the unique fluorido rhodium(III) complex cis,trans&#8208;[Rh(F)3(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (4).

         <title>Variation in Catalytic Efficacies of a 2D pH&#8208;Stable MOF by Altering Activation Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust 2D MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, has been strategically designed and developed, which showed excellent catalytic activity in three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction under solvent&#8208;free condition. The significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances is specifically highlighted.







Abstract
Although it is well&#8208;known that the Lewis acidity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can effectively enhance their catalytic activity in organic transformations, access to these Lewis&#8208;acidic sites remains a key hurdle to widespread applications of Lewis&#8208;acidic catalysis by MOFs. Easy accessibility of strong Lewis acidic sites onto 2D MOFs by using proper activation methods can be a cornerstone in attaining desired catalytic performance. Herein, we report a new 2D chemically stable MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, which displayed excellent framework robustness over a wide pH range (2&#8211;12). Benefiting from the abundant open metal sites (OMSs) and framework robustness, the catalytic activity of the developed material was explored in one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Moreover, the developed catalyst is superior in catalyzing the reactions involving sterically hindered substrate (1&#8208;naphthaldehyde) with high turnover number. A comparative catalytic study was conducted using different activation methods (chloroform and methanol exchanged activated samples), highlighting the significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances. The sustainable synthetic pathway under solvent&#8208;free conditions for a broad scope of substrates using low catalyst loading and excellent recyclability made the developed pH&#8208;stable framework a promising heterogeneous catalyst.

         <title>Investigation of Isolated IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; Anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) Ion Pairs by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum&#8208;Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IR spectra of molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. The closed&#8208;shell IrF6&#8722; anion with Oh symmetry stabilized by SOC effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrices. The M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry feature coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms.







Abstract
The molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated alkali metal fluorides MF with IrF6 and isolated in solid neon or argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. The free anions were obtained as well by co&#8208;deposition of IrF6 with laser&#8208;ablated metals (Ir or Pt) as electron sources. The products were characterized in a combined analysis of matrix IR spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations using two&#8208;component quasi&#8208;relativistic DFT methods accounting for spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effects as well as multi&#8208;reference configuration&#8208;interaction (MRCI) approaches with SOC. Inclusion of SOC is crucial in the prediction of spectra and properties of IrF6&#8722; and its alkali&#8208;metal ion pairs. The observed IR bands and the computations show that the IrF6&#8722; anion adopts an Oh structure in a nondegenerate ground state stabilized by SOC effects, and not a distorted D4h structure in a triplet ground state as suggested by scalar&#8208;relativistic calculations. The corresponding &#8220;closed&#8208;shell&#8221; M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry are stabilized by coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms, and their structural change in the series from M=Na to Cs was proven spectroscopically. There is no evidence for the formation of IrF7, IrF7&#8722; or M[IrF7] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs in our experiments.

         <title>Formation, Selective Encapsulation, and Tautomerization Control of Isoindolone Utilizing Guanidinium Sulfonate Frameworks</title>

Hydrogen bonding frameworks can do it all; catalysis, selective encapsulation, and control of tautomeric state.







Abstract
Herein we report the use of tetrakis (guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR) and bis (guanidinium) 1,5&#8208;napthalene disulfonate (G2NDS) to catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanobenzamide (1) to isoindolone (2). Moreover, we demonstrate the remarkable selectivity of these guanidinium organosulfonate hosts in encapsulating 2 over 1. By thoroughly investigating the intramolecular cyclization reaction, we determined that guanidinium and the organosulfonate moiety acts as the catalyst in this process. Additionally, 2 is selectively encapsulated, even in mixtures of other structurally similar heterocycles like indole. Furthermore, the tautomeric state of 2 (amino isoindolone (2&#8211;A) and imino isoindolinone forms (2&#8211;I)) can be controlled by utilizing different guanidinium organosulfonate frameworks.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen bonding frameworks can do it all; catalysis, selective encapsulation, and control of tautomeric state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the use of tetrakis (guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (&lt;b&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PYR&lt;/b&gt;) and bis (guanidinium) 1,5-napthalene disulfonate (&lt;b&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NDS&lt;/b&gt;) to catalyze the cyclization of 2-cyanobenzamide (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) to isoindolone (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Moreover, we demonstrate the remarkable selectivity of these guanidinium organosulfonate hosts in encapsulating &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; over &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. By thoroughly investigating the intramolecular cyclization reaction, we determined that guanidinium and the organosulfonate moiety acts as the catalyst in this process. Additionally, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is selectively encapsulated, even in mixtures of other structurally similar heterocycles like indole. Furthermore, the tautomeric state of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (amino isoindolone (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and imino isoindolinone forms (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;)) can be controlled by utilizing different guanidinium organosulfonate frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Emission for Tumor Visualization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isostructural vinylene&#8208;linked 2D COFs were constructed based on a new tetratopic D2h&#8208;symmetric monomer with two highly electron deficient s&#8208;triazine core. The fluorescence emission of the resulting D&#8722;A type COFs red&#8208;shifted with respect to the enhancement of the electronegativity of the donor unit. Their ability in non&#8208;invasive tumor visualization was further demonstrated.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with ordered &#960; structures are very promising in porous light&#8208;emitting materials. However, most of these COFs are either poor in luminescence or lack of water&#8208;stability. Herein, a series of isostructural D&#8722;A vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed based a new D2h symmetric linker 1,4&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TMTA) with high crystallinity, comparative high surface area and excellent chemical/thermal stability. Impressively, their adsorption and luminescence wavelength vary with respect to the density of &#960;&#8208;systems in the electron&#8208;donating group, which constitute the foundation for molecular engineering the luminescent properties of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. The DFT calculations further established the relationship between the luminescence properties and the donor electronic structure. Moreover, one of representative COF named FZU&#8208;203 showed inspiring applications in bioimaging, which may further provide strategic guidance for the use of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs as fluorescent nanoprobes in non&#8208;invasive medical diagnosis and visualization therapy of tumors.

         <title>Unspecific Peroxygenase (UPO) can be Tuned for Oxygenation or Halogenation Activity by Controlling the Reaction pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme&#8208;dependent unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic molecules at pH&#8197;6.0 using hydrogen peroxide to form the oxidant Compound I at the active site. Compound I can also be recruited for the oxidation of halide ions in the presence of peroxide at pH&#8197;3.0 to generate hypohalous acid for halogenation reactions. Hence, the activity of UPOs towards a substrate such as thymol can be tuned to give oxygenated or halogenated products dependent upon the pH of the reaction.







Abstract
Unspecific Peroxygenases (UPOs) are increasingly significant enzymes for selective oxygenations as they are stable, highly active and catalyze their reactions at the expense of only hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Their structural similarity to chloroperoxidase (CPO) means that UPOs can also catalyze halogenation reactions based upon the generation of hypohalous acids from halide and H2O2. Here we show that the halogenation and oxygenation modes of a UPO can be stimulated at different pH values. Using simple aromatic compounds such as thymol, we show that, at a pH of 3.0 and 6.0, either brominated or oxygenated products respectively are produced. Preparative 100&#8197;mg scale transformations of substrates were performed with 60&#8211;72&#8201;% isolated yields of brominated products obtained. A one&#8208;pot bromination&#8208;oxygenation cascade reaction on 4&#8208;ethylanisole, in which the pH was adjusted from 3.0 to 6.0 at the halfway stage, yielded sequentially brominated and oxygenated products 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethyl alcohol and 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy acetophenone with 82&#8201;% combined conversion. These results identify UPOs as an unusual example of a biocatalyst that is tunable for entirely different chemical reactions, dependent upon the reaction conditions.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Engraved Lattice&#8208;Matched NiO/NiFe2O4 Heterostructure with Ample Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Water Electrolysis and Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterophase hybrid catalyst with ample oxygen vacancies was reported via the heterogeneous interface and defect engineering strategy. The optimized geometry/electronic structure can effectively facilitate the mass transport and charge transfer process, thereby the as&#8208;prepared catalyst shows a favorable OER performance toward efficient water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma&#8208;engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8722;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus&#8208;prepared Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the two&#8208;electrode configuration water electrolyzer and rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery assembled by Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 catalyst show the potential practical application directions. This work provides an innovative avenue for strengthening OER performance toward water electrolysis and Zn&#8208;air batteries via the interface and vacancy engineering strategy.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Pyrazoles via Manganese Pincer Complex Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly defined Mn(I)&#8208;complex catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reactions employing alcohols as the carbon source enabled the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles. Symmetrical pyrazoles were made via the coupling of 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. The unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were created using the ADC reaction of primary alcohols with hydrazones.







Abstract
This report detailed the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reaction catalyzed by a well&#8208;defined manganese(I)&#8208;pincer complex. Symmetrically substituted pyrazoles were synthesized by reacting 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. Unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were selectively made via the ADC of primary alcohols with methyl hydrazones. Water and hydrogen are liberated as the green byproducts. The endurance of these methodologies has been presented by producing 30 substrates with varied functionalities. Model reactions were scaled up to demonstrate practicability. The reaction rate and order were measured to transparent the involvement of the reagents during catalysis. Control experiments elucidated the plausible reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Tetraanionic Oligo&#8208;Dioxaborines: Strongly Absorbing Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly absorbing NIR polymethines of tetraanionic nature bearing 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine rings and different electron&#8208;accepting end&#8208;groups were synthesized and characterized. Due to a highly symmetric electronic structure of tetraanionic chromophore, the obtained dyes possess exceptionally high molar absorption coefficients (exceeding half a million) and good fluorescence quantum yields (up to 0.13).







Abstract
Polymethine dyes of tetraanionic nature comprising 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine rings in the polymethine chain and end&#8208;groups of different electron&#8208;accepting abilities have been synthesized. They can be considered as oligomeric polymethines, where a linear conjugated &#960;&#8208;system passes through three 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine units and a number of tri&#8208; and dimethine &#960;&#8208;bridges between two end&#8208;groups. The obtained dyes exhibit near&#8208;infrared absorption and fluorescence, with molar absorption coefficients reaching as high as 564000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF, rendering them among the strongest absorbers known. The novel compounds are bright NIR fluorophores, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.13 in DMF. A comparative analysis of the electronic structure of the obtained dyes with respective dianionic and trianionic oligomers was conducted through quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation of Alkynes: Embracing Conventional and Electrochemical Routes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation of various aryl silanes containing a triple bond. The Ni(0) catalyst was generated through a simple reduction of the NiBr2bipy pre&#8208;catalyst using manganese metal or via electroreduction. In the latter case, the amount of electrons involved is catalytic, making the process highly manageable.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation can be efficiently achieved with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities through two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes a conventional method, involving the reduction of nickel salt (NiBr2&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) using manganese metal. The second method employs a one&#8208;step electrochemical reaction, utilizing the sacrificial anode process and NiBr2bipy catalysis. Both methods yield silylated heterocycles in good to high yields through a syn&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization process. Control experiments and molecular electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry) provided further insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>14&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;Diiminato Gold(II) &#8211; A New Member for the Gold(II) Complex Family?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of the macrocyclic gold(III) complex yields an elusive transient gold(II) species as shown by experimental (cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis, NMR, EPR spectroscopy) and quantum chemical methods (density functional theory).







Abstract
The chemistry of molecular gold compounds is dominated by the oxidation states +I and +III. For the intermediate oxidation state +II with 5d9 electron configuration, dimerization or disproportionation of the gold(II) radicals is favored, so that only a few mononuclear gold(II) complexes have been isolated to date. The present study addresses the one&#8208;electron reduction of the macrocyclic gold(III) complex [AuIIIL]+ of the innocent &#946;&#8208;diiminato ligand L2&#8722; with a 14&#8208;membered macrocycle (L2&#8722;=5,7,12,14&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradeca&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraenato). Electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and chemical reduction of [AuIIIL]+ monitored by UV/Vis, NMR and EPR spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations reveal disproportionation of the initially generated but elusive gold(II) complex AuIIL and provide guidelines for prospective stable mononuclear tetraazamacrocyclic gold(II) complexes.

         <title>Polyaniline/Tungsten Trioxide Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Anode for Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding rate performance, stability and high capacity of aqueous proton batteries has attracted numerous attentions. We development a new aqueous proton battery system with organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials (WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI). Thus, it shows obviously improved electrochemical performance of high capacity and long cycle life. It can play a certain enlightening role in the research and development of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries have received increasing attention due to their outstanding rate performance, stability and high capacity. However, the selection of anode materials in strongly acidic electrolytes poses a challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous proton batteries. This study optimized the proton reaction kinetics of layered metal oxide WO3 by introducing interlayer structural water and coating polyaniline (PANI) on its surface to prepare organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material (WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI). We constructed an aqueous proton battery with WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI anode and MnO2@GF cathode. After 1500 cycles at a current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacity retention rate can still reach 80.2&#8201;%. These results can inspire the development of new aqueous proton batteries.

         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene is presented here as a suitable and selective reactant for delivering either prenyl or isobutylenyl groups to alkenes through a cross&#8208;metathesis reaction. The process smoothly operates at room temperature, give high yields of products, includes a late&#8208;stage transformation, and enables the valorization of real samples of recycled rubber.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene is a readily available and easily managable compound, whose symmetric and polymethylated dienic structure should be prone to engage in cross&#8208;metathesis reactions with other alkenes, but this has not been apparently exploited so far. Here we show that this reactant enables the easy synthesis of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;susbtituted alkenes (i.&#8201;e. isobutylenyl and prenyl groups) from simple alkenes under mild reaction conditions, not only with the conventional 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst but also with other Grela&#8208;type catalyts such as StickyCat,TM AquaMetTM and GreenCatTM. The use of liquid and low volatile 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene avoids the use of gaseous alkene reactants and, besides, showcases the reactivity of polyisoprene (rubber), thus allowing to optimize the reaction conditions for rubber upcycling, after metathesis reaction of the pristine or used polymer with simple alkenes. These results bring low volatile isoprene&#8208;type compounds as privileged poly&#8208;substituted reactants for alkene cross&#8208;metathesis reactions.

         <title>Generation and Identification of the Trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs and Isomeric Perfluorinated Arsasilene FAsSiF2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel silylarsinidene F3SiAs and its isomer arsasilene FAsSiF2 are generated via the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated silicon atoms with AsF3 in low&#8208;temperature matrices and identified by matrix isolation IR spectroscopy as well as theoretical calculations. The isomerization of arsasilene FAsSiF2 to silylarsinidene F3SiAs under UV light (&#955; = 275&#8197;nm) was also observed.







Abstract
The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs in the triplet ground state has been generated through the reaction of laser&#8208;ablated silicon atoms with AsF3 in cryogenic Ne&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices. The reactions proceed with the initial formation of perfluorinated arsasilene FAsSiF2 in the singlet ground state by two As&#8722;F bonds insertion reaction on annealing. The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs was formed via F&#8208;migration reactions of FAsSiF2 under irradiation at UV light (&#955; = 275&#8197;nm). The characterization of FAsSiF2 and F3SiAs by IR matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopy is supported by computations at CCSD(T)&#8208;F12/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory.

         <title>Reductions of Arenes using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diene from a Birching. A magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductions of an array of unfunctionalized and functionalized arenes. The former proceed via &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reductions, while the latter typically result in reductive C&#8722;E (E=O, F or P) cleavage reactions.







Abstract
In this contribution, we present &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221;, and other reductions of simple arenes by the potassium salt of an anionic magnesium dinitrogen complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] (TCHPNON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), which acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in these reactions. This reagent is non&#8208;hazardous, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and in some cases provides access to 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene reduction products under relatively mild reaction conditions. This system works effectively to reduce benzene, naphthalene and anthracene through magnesium&#8208;bound &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates. Cyclohexadiene products can be subsequently released from the magnesium centres by protonolysis with methanol. In contrast, the reduction of substituted arenes is less selective and involves competing reaction pathways. For toluene and 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, the structural authentication of &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates is conclusive, although the formation of corresponding 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives was low yielding. Reduction of anisole did not yield an isolable &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; intermediate, but instead gave a C&#8722;O activation product. Treating triphenylphosphine with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] resulted in the extrusion of both biphenyl and dinitrogen to afford a magnesium(II) phosphanide [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)}2]. Reduction of fluorobenzene proceeded via C&#8722;F activation of the arene, and isolation of the magnesium(II) fluoride [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}2]. Finally, the two&#8208;electron reduction of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] yielded a complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;COT)], incorporating the aromatic dianion (COT2&#8722;).

Abstract
Some nanomaterials with intrinsic protease&#8208;like activity have the advantages of good stability, biosafety, low price, large&#8208;scale preparation and unique property of nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for natural proteases in various applications. An especial term, &#8220;nanoprotease&#8221;, has been coined to stress the intrinsic proteolytic property of these nanomaterials. As a new generation of artificial proteases, they have become a burgeoning field, attracting many researchers to design and synthesize high performance nanoproteases. In this review, we summarize recent progress on all types of nanoproteases with regard of their activity, mechanism and application and introduce a new and effective strategy for engineering high&#8208;performance nanoproteases. In addition, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of nanoprotease research in the future.

         <title>Application of Sublimation in the Synthesis and Crystal Growth of Organosulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes undergo aromatization and elimination of phenylsulfinic acid during sublimation leading to the growth of high quality, pure single crystals of the resulting (4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls in the desublimation area.







Abstract
The solvent&#8208;free elimination of sulfinic acid and aromatization of 1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes is reported. It is shown that sublimation can be used as a &#8216;green&#8217; method to combine the thermal transformation of six trienes and the crystal growth of the resulting 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls. When the sublimation conditions are carefully controlled, high quality single crystals of the 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls are obtained. Theoretical modelling of the reaction using the simplified triene Ph&#8208;(CH)6&#8208;SO2H showed that the cyclization is energetically feasible and that the complete conversion is possible during the timescale of the sublimation. At temperatures slightly higher than the optimum sublimation temperature two of the trienes transformed into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes that did not eliminate phenylsulfinic acid. A reaction mechanism involving a 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift induced by free PhS&#8226; radicals is proposed for the formation of the 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene as Precursor of 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;Substituted Long&#8208;Axially Symmetric Pyrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene was achieved with an overall yield of 71&#8201;%. This compound was successfully converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron donor&#8211;acceptor groups, which exhibits photophysical properties markedly distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers. These findings are valuable for the development of novel pyrene&#8208;based emitting materials.







Abstract
Pyrene derivatives bearing substituents at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 find numerous applications, as exemplified by their use in lasers, sensors, and bioimaging probes. However, these derivatives typically have point&#8208;symmetric or short&#8208;axially symmetric structures, whereas long&#8208;axially symmetric derivatives remain underexplored because of the difficulty in obtaining their precursor, 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene. To address this problem, we herein synthesized 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene in an overall yield (71&#8201;% over four steps) considerably exceeding those of existing methods. 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene was converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron&#8208;donor (alkoxy) groups at positions 1 and 3 and electron&#8208;acceptor (formyl) groups at positions 6 and 8. 13OPA exhibited photophysical properties distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers, featuring a broad and strongly redshifted absorption, strong fluorescence with reduced sensitivity to protic solvents, and small dipole moment change upon photoexcitation. The derivatization of 13OPA into a Schiff base and its functionalization via Lewis acid&#8208;base pairing were also demonstrated. Thus, our work expands the design scope of pyrene&#8208;based molecules, particularly those used as emitters.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient synthesis of 1,3-dibromopyrene from 1-methoxypyrene was achieved with an overall yield of 71&#8201;%. This compound was successfully converted into 13OPA, a long-axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron donor&#8211;acceptor groups, which exhibits photophysical properties markedly distinct from those of its point-symmetric and short-axially symmetric isomers. These findings are valuable for the development of novel pyrene-based emitting materials.

         <title>Linear, Planar, Orbicular, and Macrocyclic Multinuclear Zinc (Meth)acrylate Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Just as a station is the starting point of a journey and each person has their own destination, different shapes of complexes can be obtained starting from zinc (meth)acrylate. The recrystallization of zinc methacrylate from THF and water afforded a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex, whereas that of zinc acrylate formed a sheet&#8208;like pentanuclear core with hydroxido ligands. The treatment of zinc (meth)acrylate with ZnO led to tetranuclear complex with oxido ligand. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwasaki, K. Nozaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400586).

         <title>Polymorphism of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Coordination Polymers: Impact of a Lead&#8211;Sulfur Network on Photoconductivity</title>

         <dc:description>
The cover picture shows two polymorphs of a 2D PbII coordination polymer with Pb&#8722;S bonds. The thermodynamic product features a 2D architecture composed of quasi&#8208;2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with weak, nonbonded Pb&#8722;S bonds, whereas the kinetic product forms a 2D structure containing intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with Pb&#8722;S bonds. Moreover, the kinetic product exhibits higher photoconductivity than the thermodynamic product owing to the presence of the intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Tanaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400618).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New perspectives in GaI and InI chemistry: The salts of &#8216;naked&#8217; M+ (M = Ga, In) ions with a weakly coordinating, fluorinated alkoxyaluminate anion have been isolated, and the stability of M+ with this anion in the coordinating solvents acetonitrile and diethyl ether has been demonstrated. The results will allow the coordination chemistry of M+ with weak ligands and the reactivity of M+ in standard solvents to be examined. The cover portrays these new possibilities as M+ hikers in a mysterious nighttime landscape. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Krossing and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400897).

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Activation of Photoacids and Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength&#8208;resolved photoreactivity of a photoacid and a base is mapped in a simple and facile manner via pH monitoring, revealing a marked mismatch of photochemical reactivity and absorptivity of the acids and bases.







Abstract
Photoacids and bases allow remote control over pH in reaction solutions, which is of fundamental importance to an array of applications. Herein, we determine the wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength resolved photoreactivity of triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts as a representative photoacid generator and p&#8208;(benzoyl)benzyl triethylammonium tetraphenylborate as a photobase generator, constructing a wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemical action plot for each of the compounds. We monitor the pH change of the solution on&#8208;line within the cavity of the laser vial and demonstrate a marked mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the photoacid and base with the photochemical action plot, unveiling reactivity at very low absorptivities. Our findings are of critical importance for the use of photoacids and bases, unambiguously demonstrating that absorption is no guide to chemical reactivity with critical consequences for the wavelength employed in applications of photoacids and bases.

         <title>Fagopyrins from Buckwheat Flowers: Structural and Stereochemical Characterization Through Combined NMR/CD Spectroscopy and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, nine fagopyrin isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated by integrated 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy studies. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity.







Abstract
Fagopyrins are phenantroperylenequinones present in the flowers of Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) endowed with photodynamic activity. It has been reported that fagopyrin extracts actually contain a complex mixture of closely related compounds, differing only on the nature of the perylenequinone substituents. We report our systematic and detailed study on the chemical composition of fagopyrin extracts by a combination of preparative and analytical techniques. The combined use of 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy was found to be particularly suited to fully characterize all stereochemical aspects of the extracted fagopyrins. For the first time nine isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, thus giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity found in the extract.

         <title>Challenges in the Synthesis and Processing of Hydrosilanes as Precursors for Silicon Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Liquid hydrosilanes are required for the production of silicon films. The silicon layers can be processed for electronic devices like transistors or thin&#8208;film solar cells. Hydrosilanes are highly reactive and pyrophoric. Therefore, the synthesis of these compounds is challenging and dangerous. The available synthesis methods for hydrosilanes are reviewed and compared.
Hydrosilanes are highly attractive compounds, which can be processed as liquids with printing technology to amorphous silicon films on nearly any solid substrate. The silicon layers can be processed for electronic devices like transistors or thin&#8208;film solar cells. The endothermic character of hydrosilanes with their positive enthalpies of formation results in favorable properties for processing. The larger the molecules, the lower their decomposition temperature and the higher their photoactivity. Cyclic hydrosilanes such as cyclopentasilane and cyclohexasilane can be easily deposited. The branched neopentasilane is more difficult to deposit but yields better&#8208;quality films after processing.
The key challenge is the complex synthesis of the precursors and the hydrosilanes. The available preparative methods are presented in this review and their advantages and disadvantages are evaluated. The following synthesis methods are presented and discussed in this article: Wurtz coupling and other reductive coupling processes, dehydrogenative coupling of silanes, plasma synthesis of chlorinated polysilanes, amine&#8208; or chloride&#8208;induced disproportionations, and transformation of monosilane to higher silanes.
Plasma synthesis is already carried out today as a continuous industrial process. The most effective synthesis methods in the laboratory are currently amine&#8208; and chloride&#8208;induced disproportionations. There is a great need to further optimize the syntheses of hydrosilanes and to develop new simple synthesis variants.

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Methylglyoxal on the Conformation, Function, and Aggregation Propensity of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylglyoxal reacts with &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) by forming a heterogeneous mixture of reaction products on specific Lys. Among them highlights the 2&#8208;ammonio&#8208;6&#8208;[1&#8208;(5&#8208;ammonio&#8208;6&#8208;oxido&#8208;6&#8208;oxohexyl)&#8208;5&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;3&#8208;yl] hexanoate (MOLD), which crosslinks two Lys. The formation of these MG&#8208;derived AGEs had a scarce effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;S, but they completely depleted its native propensity to aggregate and its ability to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that people suffering from hyperglycemia have a higher propensity to develop Parkinson's disease (PD). One of the most plausible mechanisms linking these two pathologies is the glycation of neuronal proteins and the pathological consequences of it. &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, a key component in PD, can be glycated at its fifteen lysine. In fact, the end products of this process have been detected on aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein isolated from in&#8197;vivo. However, the consequences of glycation are not entirely clear, which are of crucial importance to understand the mechanism underlying the connection between diabetes and PD. To better clarify this, we have here examined how methylglyoxal (the most important carbonyl compound found in the cytoplasm) affects the conformation and aggregation propensity of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, as well as its ability to cluster and fuse synaptic&#8208;like vesicles. The obtained data prove that methylglyoxal induces the Lys&#8208;Lys crosslinking through the formation of MOLD. However, this does not have a remarkable effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, although it completely depletes its native propensity to form soluble oligomers and insoluble amyloid fibrils. Moreover, methylglyoxal has a disrupting effect on the ability of &#945;&#8208;synuclein to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.

         <title>Selective Lattice Doping Enables a Low&#8208;Cost, High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Lasting Potassium Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium and Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel P3&#8208;type oxide, K0.57Cu0.1Fe0.1Mn0.8O2, is proposed to enhance KxMnO2 cathodes by addressing intrinsic issues and optimizing electrochemical properties. The co&#8208;doping strategy of multifunctional Cu and Fe element makes potassium&#8208;ion batteries more competitive for sustainable, low&#8208;cost energy storage. Additionally, the cathode can be adapted for sodium ion storage, offering a promising pathway for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides are highly promising host materials for K ions, owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate operational potentials. To address the intrinsic issues of KxMnO2 cathodes and optimize their electrochemical properties, a novel P3&#8208;type oxide doped with carefully chosen cost&#8208;effective, electrochemically active and multi&#8208;functional elements is proposed, namely K0.57Cu0.1Fe0.1Mn0.8O2. Compared to the pristine K0.56MnO2, its reversible specific is increased from 104 to 135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, the Cu and Fe co&#8208;doping triples the capacity under high current densities, and contributes to long&#8208;term stability over 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 68&#8201;%. Such endeavor holds the potential to make potassium&#8208;ion batteries particularly competitive for application in sustainable, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. In addition, the cathode is also extended for sodium storage. Facilitated by the interlayer K ions that protect the layered structure from collapsing and expand the diffusion pathway for sodium ions, the cathode shows a high reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, fast kinetics and a long lifespan over 1000&#8197;cycles. The findings offer a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

Engineering modular DNA reaction networks. Functional units are flexibly selected, adjusted, and combined to construct modular DNA reaction networks for performing various signal processing tasks.







Abstract
Diversified molecular information&#8208;processing methods have significant implications for nanoscale manipulation and control, monitoring and disease diagnosis of organisms, and direct intervention in biological activities. However, as an effective approach for implementing multifunctional molecular information processing, DNA reaction networks (DRNs) with numerous functionally specialized molecular structures have challenged them on scale design, leading to increased network complexity, further causing problems such as signal leakage, attenuation, and cross&#8208;talk in network reactions. Our study developed a strategy for performing various signal&#8208;processing tasks through engineering modular DRNs. This strategy is based on a universal core unit with signal selection capability, and a time&#8208;adjustable signal self&#8208;resetting module is achieved by combing the core unit and self&#8208;resetting unit, which improves the time controllability of modular DRNs. In addition, multi&#8208;input and &#8208;output signal cross&#8208;catalytic and continuously adjustable signal delay modules were realized by combining core and threshold units, providing a flexible, precise method for modular DRNs to process the signal. The strategy simplifies the design of DRNs, helps generate design ideas for large&#8208;scale integrated DRNs with multiple functions, and provides prospects in biocomputing, gene regulation, and biosensing.

         <title>Opportunities of MXenes in Heterogeneous Catalysis: V2C as Aerobic Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept aims to illustrate the possibility to employ V2C MXene as a reusable heterogeneous solid catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of indane to indanol/indanone mixture with high conversion and selectivity under solvent free conditions. Further, the influence of surface terminal groups in MXene in oxidation reaction is also studied.







Abstract
MXenes are two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials having alternating sheets of one atom&#8208;thick early transition metal layer and one atom&#8208;thick carbide or nitride layer. The external surface contains termination groups, whose nature depends on the etching agent used in the preparation procedure from the MAX phase. The present concept proposes that, due to their composition, the metal&#8208;surface termination groups make MXenes particularly suited as heterogeneous catalysts for some reactions. This proposal comes from the consideration that early transition metal atoms bonded to hydroxyl and oxo groups are a general type of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis and that similar catalytic centers can also be present in the MXene structure. After having presented the concept, we have selected V2C Mxene as an example to illustrate its catalytic activity and to show how the catalytic performance varies when the surface groups are modified. As a test reaction, we selected the aerobic oxidation of indane to the corresponding indanol/indanone mixture using molecular oxygen as terminal oxidizing reagent. Two previously reported procedures to modify the surface groups, namely surface dehydroxylation by thermal treatment under diluted hydrogen flow and surface oxidation with ammonium persulfate to convert some surface groups into oxo groups were used, observing in both cases a decrease in the catalytic activity of V2C. Based on this, VIII/IV&#8208;OH are proposed as catalytic centers in this aerobic oxidation. Overall, the present concept shows the merits of MXenes in heterogeneous catalysis, based on their chemical composition and the surface functionality.

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;i&gt;concept&lt;/i&gt; aims to illustrate the possibility to employ V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C MXene as a reusable heterogeneous solid catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of indane to indanol/indanone mixture with high conversion and selectivity under solvent free conditions. Further, the influence of surface terminal groups in MXene in oxidation reaction is also studied.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MXenes are two-dimensional nanomaterials having alternating sheets of one atom-thick early transition metal layer and one atom-thick carbide or nitride layer. The external surface contains termination groups, whose nature depends on the etching agent used in the preparation procedure from the MAX phase. The present &lt;i&gt;concept&lt;/i&gt; proposes that, due to their composition, the metal-surface termination groups make MXenes particularly suited as heterogeneous catalysts for some reactions. This proposal comes from the consideration that early transition metal atoms bonded to hydroxyl and oxo groups are a general type of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis and that similar catalytic centers can also be present in the MXene structure. After having presented the concept, we have selected V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C Mxene as an example to illustrate its catalytic activity and to show how the catalytic performance varies when the surface groups are modified.

Based on this, V&lt;sup&gt;III/IV&lt;/sup&gt;-OH are proposed as catalytic centers in this aerobic oxidation. Overall, the present &lt;i&gt;concept&lt;/i&gt; shows the merits of MXenes in heterogeneous catalysis, based on their chemical composition and the surface functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Engineering of Acridine Donor to Optimize Color Purity of Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor engineering of dimethylacridine by incorporating fluorophenyl or trifluoromethylphenyl groups regularly shifts the fluorescence to sky blue region by 24 and 39&#8197;nm for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, but keeps high external quantum efficiencies in OLEDs at 22.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
9,9&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) is one of the most widely used electron donor for constructing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, DMAC&#8208;based emitters often suffer from the imperfect color purity, particularly in blue emitters, due to its strong electron&#8208;donating capability. To modulate donor strength, 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC were designed by introducing the electron&#8208;withdrawing 2&#8208;fluorophenyl and 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl at the 2,7&#8208;positions of DMAC. These donors were used, in combination with 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor, to develop novel TADF emitters 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ. Compared to the F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;free reference emitter, both two emitters showed hypsochromic effect in fluorescence and comparable photoluminescence quantum yields without sacrificing the reverse intersystem crossing rate constants. In particular, 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ based OLED exhibited a blue shift by up to 39&#8197;nm and significantly improved Commission International de l&#8242;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.36, 0.55) to (0.22, 0.41), while the external quantum efficiency kept stable at about 22.5&#8201;%. This donor engineering strategy should be valid for improving the color purity of large amount of acridine based TADF emitters. It can be predicted that pure blue TADF emitters should be feasible if these F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;modifed acridine donors are combined with other weaker electron acceptors.

         <title>Engineering Amino Acid and Peptide Supramolecular Architectures through Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination of amino acids deeply affects their self&#8208;assembly, enhancing, for instance, their tendency to aggregate into fibrils and gels. The conformational changes induced by fluorine can also change their functions, as well as the bioactivity of the deriving peptides and proteins, allowing to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable properties.







Abstract
Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are attracting considerable research interest, especially in the biomedical field and in materials science, thanks to their ability to self&#8208;assemble into peculiar supramolecular structures. The conformational changes induced by the presence of fluorine atoms obviously affect their functions, as well as the biological activity of the deriving peptides and proteins. Here, we will briefly describe the main effects of fluorination on the aggregation behavior of such building blocks, focusing in particular on their improved tendency to form fibrils, and gels therefrom. Our aim is to underline the promising potential of fluorination as a tool to affect the self&#8208;assembly features of amino acids, both when used alone and when inserted into polypeptide sequences. The ability of fluorine to influence physical, chemical, and structural properties of these substrates offers the possibility to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable functions.

         <dc:description>
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) is a popular material at present. Its preparation methods are various, mainly can be divided into direct synthesis and indirect synthesis. Because of its special structural advantages, it has been widely used in Enantiomer recognition, Enantiomer separation, Circularly polarized luminescence and Asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) is a kind of material with great application value in recent years. Formed by the coordination of metal ions or metal clusters with organic ligands. It has ordered and adjustable pores, multi&#8208;dimensional network structure, large specific surface area and excellent adsorption properties. This material structure combines the properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with the chiral properties of chiral molecules. It has great advantages in catalysis, adsorption, separation and other fields. Therefore, it has a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, medicine and materials science. In this paper, various synthesis strategies and preparation methods of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks are reviewed from different perspectives, and the advantages of each method are analyzed. In addition, the applications of chiral metal&#8208;organic framework materials in enantiomer recognition and separation, circular polarization luminescence and asymmetric catalysis are systematically summarized, and the corresponding mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the development of chiral metal&#8208;organic frame materials are analyzed in detail.

         <title>Injectable Chitosan Hydrogels Doped with 2D Peptide Nanosheet&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Sustained Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule&#8208;responsive drug release system based on 2D peptide nanosheets (PNSs) has been developed by using chitosan (CS) hydrogel as a sustained&#8208;release platform. The PNS&#8208;CS&#8208;based drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, and the improved cellular uptake shown offers potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective drug delivery systems aimed at enhancing therapeutic profile and efficacy of therapeutic agents is a critical challenge in modern medicine. This study presents an intelligent drug delivery system based on self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional peptide nanosheets (2D PNSs). Leveraging the tunable properties of amino acid structures and sequences, we design a peptide with the sequence of Fmoc&#8208;FKKGSHC, which self&#8208;assembles into 2D PNSs with uniform structure, high biocompatibility, and excellent degradability. Covalent attachment of thiol&#8208;modified doxorubicin (DOX) drugs to 2D PNSs via disulfide bond results in the peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs), which is denoted as PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX. Subsequently, the PDCs are encapsulated within the injectable, thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogels for drug delivery. The designed drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, which are facilitated by the characteristics of the CS hydrogels. Meanwhile, the covalently linked disulfide bond within the PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX is responsive to intracellular glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells, enabling controlled drug release and significantly inhibiting the cancer cell growth. This responsive peptide&#8208;drug conjugate based on a 2D peptide nanoplatform paves the way for the development of smart drug delivery systems and has bright prospects in the future biomedicine field.

This concept article elucidates the significant factors affecting discharge intermediates and reaction pathways of the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries and highlights a *Li2O&#8208;mediated surface lithiation mechanism.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries facilitate renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, particularly in terms of the theoretical aspect. First, the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates are highlighted, and a surface lithiation mechanism predominantly applicable to catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption is proposed. Subsequently, the modeling of the chemical potential of Li++e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage, is detailed. Finally, challenges and future directions pertaining to the further development of Li&#8722;CO2 are discussed. In essence, this concept article seeks to inspire future experimental and theoretical studies in advancing the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.

         <title>Endowing Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Materials with Chiroptical Activity by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the chirality transfer from chiral anions to cationic coordination components, efficient circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence properties are realized. Such a chiral anion strategy is successfully implemented in ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The chiroptical properties can be modulated by the use of different chiral anions.







Abstract
Recently, chiral metal&#8208;organic coordination materials have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of applications in chiroptoelectronics, chiral catalysis, and information encryption, etc. Notably, the chiroptical effect of coordination chromophores makes them appealing for applications such as photodetectors, OLEDs, 3D displays, and bioimaging. The direct synthesis of chiral coordination materials using chiral organic ligands or complexes with metal&#8208;centered chirality is very often tedious and costly. In the case of ionic coordination materials, the combination of chiral anions with cationic, achiral coordination compounds through noncovalent interactions may endow molecular materials with desirable chiroptical properties. The use of such a simple chiral strategy has been proven effective in inducing promising circular dichroism and/or circularly polarized luminescence signals. This concept article mainly delves into the latest advances in exploring the efficacy of such a chiral anion strategy for transforming achiral coordination materials into chromophores with superb photo&#8208; or electro&#8208;chiroptical properties. In particular, ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks containing chiral anions are discussed. A perspective on the future opportunities on the preparation of chiroptical materials with the chiral anion strategy is also presented.

         <title>Scope and Limitations of Using Microemulsions for the Covalent Patterning of Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the scope and limitations of using microemulsions (MEMs) as templates to pattern graphene covalently. This methodology is very simple and can be used to obtain functionalization in either the major (out&#8208;patterning) or the minor (in&#8208;patterning) components of the MEM.







Abstract
Patterning of graphene (functionalizing some areas while leaving others intact) is challenging, as all the C atoms in the basal plane are identical, but it is also desirable for a variety of applications, like opening a bandgap in the electronic structure of graphene. Several methods have been reported to pattern graphene, but most of them are very technologically intensive. Recently, we reported the use of microemulsions as templates to pattern graphene at the &#956;m scale. This method is very simple and in principle tunable, as emulsions of different droplet size and composition can be prepared easily. Here, we explore in detail the scope of this methodology by applying it to all the combinations of four different emulsions and three different organic reagents, and characterizing the resulting substrates exhaustively through Raman, SEM and AFM. We find that the method is general, works better when the reactive species are outside the micelles, and requires reactive species that involve short reaction times.

Controlling the cis/trans isomerism of the dimers [R2Al(&#956;&#8208;2&#8208;py&#8217;)]2 is the key to the development of co&#8208;operative cationic Al(III) catalysts that may offer stereo&#8208;control of alkene insertion during polymerization, in a similar way to established Zr(IV)&#8208;based systems. Substitution at the 6&#8208;position of the 2&#8208;py&#8217; groups favors the desired C2&#8208;symmetric trans isomer and the stability of the cations [{RAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ formed by demethylation.







Abstract
Owing to its high natural abundance compared to the commonly used transition (precious) metals, as well as its high Lewis acidity and ability to change oxidation state, aluminium has recently been explored as the basis for a range of single&#8208;site catalysts. This paper aims to establish the ground rules for the development of a new type of cationic alkene oligomerisation catalyst containing two Al(III) ions, with the potential to act co&#8208;operatively in stereoselective assembly. Five new dimers of the type [R2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 (R=Me, iBu; py&#8242;=substituted pyridyl group) with different substituents on the Al atoms and pyridyl rings have been synthesised. The formation of the undesired cis isomers can be suppressed by the presence of substituents on the 6&#8208;position of the pyridyl ring due to steric congestion, with DFT calculations showing that the selection of the trans isomer is thermodynamically controlled. Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 with Ph3C+ to the cations [{MeAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ is highly favourable and that the desired trans disposition of the 2&#8208;pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects. Preliminary experimental studies confirm that demethylation of [Me2Al(6&#8208;MeO&#8208;2&#8208;py)]2 can be achieved using [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4].

Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(2-py&#8242;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the cations [{MeAl(2-py&#8217;)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-Me)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is highly favourable and that the desired &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; disposition of the 2-pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects. Preliminary experimental studies confirm that demethylation of [Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(6-MeO-2-py)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be achieved using [Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Composition and Conformation of Hetero&#8208; versus Homo&#8208;Fluorinated Triazolamers Influence their Activity on Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While fluorinated molecules constitute nearly 30&#8201;% of all newly approved drugs, and peptidomimetic foldamers provide original solutions to resolve certain peptide problems, the interest of fluorinated foldamers is still little addressed. The conformational and biological interest of fluorinated triazolamers as an alternative to natural peptides is demonstrated here.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated foldamers based on aminomethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;difluoroacetic acid (1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2) units were synthesized and their conformational behaviour was studied by NMR and molecular dynamics. Their activity on the aggregation of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) amyloid protein was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The fluorine labelling of these foldamers allowed the analysis of their interaction with the target protein. We demonstrated that the preferred extended conformation of homotriazolamers of 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 unit increases the aggregation of hIAPP, while the hairpin&#8208;like conformation of more flexible heterotriazolamers containing two 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units mixed with natural amino acids from the hIAPP sequence reduces it, and more efficiently than the parent natural peptide. The longer heterotriazolamers having three 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units adopting more folded hairpin&#8208;like and ladder&#8208;like structures similar to short multi&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheets have no effect. This work demonstrates that a good balance between the structuring and flexibility of these foldamers is necessary to allow efficient interaction with the target protein.

The preparation of substituted 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes through the reaction of alkenes with photolytically&#8208;generated chlorocarbenes from chlorodiazirines is reported as an effective method.

The use of 380&#8197;nm irradiation conditions was effectively extended to the synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes (3 examples).

         <title>Superalkalis with Hydrogen as Central Electronegative Atom and their Possible Applications: Ab Initio and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superalkalis having hydrogen as central electronegative core are designed. They exhibit very low ionization energies even lower than that of cesium. The superalkalis are capable of reducing molecules having very low electron affinities. They can act as the building blocks of supersalts and also show remarkable non&#8208;linear optical property.







Abstract
Superalkalis are unusual species having ionization energies lower than that of the alkali metals. These species with various applications are of great importance in chemistry due to their low ionization energies and strong reducing property. A typical superalkali contains a central electronegative core decorated with excess metal ligands. In the quest for novel superalkalis, we have designed the superalkalis HLi2, HLiNa and HNa2 using hydrogen as central electronegative atom for the first time employing high level ab initio (CCSD(T), MP2) and density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) methods. The superalkalis exhibit very low ionization energies, even lower than that of cesium. Stability of these species is verified from binding energy and dissociation energy values. The superalkalis are capable of reducing SO2, NO, CO2, CO and N2 molecules by forming stable ionic complexes and therefore can be used as catalysts for the reduction or activation of systems possessing very low electron affinities. The superalkalis form stable supersalts with tailored properties when interact with a superhalogen. They also show remarkably high non&#8208;linear optical responses, hence could have industrial applications. It is hoped that this work will enrich the superalkali family and spur further theoretical and experimental research in this direction.

We report herein the design of the asymmetric synthesis of orientational atropisomers via Sonogashira coupling as the key step. This new category of orientational atropisomers is anticipated to have a broad impact on chemical, biomedical, and material sciences in the future.







Abstract
New chiral targets of orientational chirality have been designed and asymmetrically synthesized by taking advantage of N&#8208;sulfinyl imine&#8208;directed nucleophilic addition/oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Orientation of single isomers has been selectively controlled by using aryl/alkynyl levers [C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) axis] and tBuSO2&#8208; protecting group on nitrogen as proven by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The key structural characteristic of resulting orientational products is shown by remote through&#8208;space blocking manner. Seventeen examples of multi&#8208;step synthesis were obtained with modest to good chemical yields and complete orientational selectivity.

         <title>Controlling the Crystal Growth of DNA Molecules via Strategic Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>

Controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules remains elusive. Herein we have successfully accelerated the crystal growth of DNA molecules by introducing the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation into their stacking sites, and decelerated it by introducing the phosphorothioate. Further, we have developed a novel strategy for controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions are critical to the crystallization of biomolecules, yet the precise control of biomolecular crystal growth based on these interactions remains elusive. To understand the connections between the crystallization kinetics and the strength of intermolecular interactions, herein we have employed DNA triangular crystals and modified ones as a versatile tool to investigate how the strength of intermolecular interaction affects crystal growth. Interestingly, we have found that the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation at sticky ends of the DNA triangle could strengthen its intermolecular interaction, resulting in the accelerated formation of smaller crystals. Conversely, phosphorothioate modification could weaken the sticky&#8208;end cohesion and delay the nucleation, resulting in formation of fewer but larger crystals. In addition, these modification effects were consistently observed in the crystallization of a DNA decamer. In one word, our experimental results demonstrate that the strength of intermolecular interaction directly impacts crystal growth. It suggests that 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation and phosphorothioate modification represents a rational strategy for controlling DNA molecules grow into desired crystals and it also facilitates structural determination.

Hydrolytically stable palladium and platinum diaminocarbene complexes exhibit nanomolar antiproliferative activity and high selectivity for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. Our lead drug candidate surpasses cisplatin by 300 times in vitro and exhibits superior efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice. The critical role of interference with metabolic processes and redox homeostasis in achieving excellent selectivity for cancer cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
Hydrolytically stable PdII and PtII complexes supported by acyclic diaminocarbene ligands represent a novel class of structural organometallic anticancer agents exhibiting nanomolar antiproliferative activity in a panel of cancer cell lines (IC50 0.07&#8211;0.81&#8197;&#956;M) and up to 300&#8208;fold selectivity for cancer cells over normal primary fibroblasts. The lead drug candidate was 300 times more potent than cisplatin in&#8197;vitro and showed higher efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Aminobenzocoumarins as Fluorescent Probes for Biological Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pH probes applicable in staining lysosomes in live human cells have been synthesized and characterized. These aminobenzocoumarins display large Stokes shifts, emission in the visible region, and up to 300&#8208;fold emission intensity increase upon activation in acidic conditions.







Abstract
Regulation of pH plays an essential role in orchestrating the delicate cellular machinery responsible for life as we know it. Its abnormal values are indicative of aberrant cellular behavior and associated with pathologies including cancer progression or solid tumors. Here, we report a series of bent and linear aminobenzocoumarins decorated with different substituents. We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH&#8208;responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300&#8208;fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.

         <title>Enhancing Intramolecular Ferromagnetic Coupling in Tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Based Compounds through Spin Polarization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) J&#8208;coupling between spin&#8208;polarized&#8208;donor radicals like Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF+&#8901;) and Nitronyl&#8208;Nitroxide (NN) connected by a coupler, such as in BTBN, is a key ingredient to achieve magnetoresistant response. In silico modifications of BTBN accomplish the enhancement of the FM coupling by using hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene as coupler, while preserving BTBN&#8242;s structure, providing promising candidates for a (possibly) improved magnetoresistance material.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized donor radicals based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives and nitronyl nitroxide (NN) radicals in which one&#8208;electron oxidation involves the HOMO instead of the SOMO are well known for exhibiting magnetoresistance. In particular, BTBN consists of one dibromo&#8208;TTF and one NN radical, which are linked by a phenyl coupler group. One of the key factors driving magnetoresistance is the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the oxidized &#960;&#8208;donor (TTF+&#8901;, D unit) and NN (R unit). Here, a theoretical study is carried out to assess suitable candidates with enhanced FM coupling with respect BTBN, which is thus used as a reference. The study is conducted via in silico chemical modification of the substituents of the BTBN basic functional units (D and R radicals, C coupler) to benefit from the spin polarization mechanism to boost the intramolecular FM coupling, aiming to distort the BTBN radical arrangement within the molecular crystal as little as possible, in the event the material can be synthesized. NICSiso(1) and Wiberg's Bond Order are analyzed to further assist in identifying promising potential candidates, since the decrease in aromaticity is expected to enhance the diradical character and give rise to a larger magnetic coupling value. The most favorable diradical building block to replace the BTBN moiety results from using a hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene (&#8722;(H)C=C(OH)&#8722;) as a coupler preserving BTBN original radicals, namely, NN and TTF+&#8901; units. This study aims at illustrating the feasibility of improving the intramolecular FM interaction between radical moieties, which is fully realized, as a first step towards the synthesis of new materials with (possibly) enhanced magnetoresistance properties.

         <title>Cellular Uptake of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Activated by Amphiphilic p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their ability to activate the uptake of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) into vesicles and into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells is reported. First mechanistic studies suggest that CX4&#8208;Cn are excellent to afford an efficient cellular delivery of CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their application as efficient counterion activators for membrane transport of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). The enhanced membrane activity is confirmed with the carboxyfluorescein (CF) assay in vesicles and by the direct cytosolic delivery of CPPs into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells enabling excellent cellular uptake of the CPPs into two cancer cell lines. Intracellular delivery was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after CPP entry into live cells mediated by CX4&#8208;Cn, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships for calixarene&#8208;based counterion activators and show that CX4&#8208;Cn are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, CX4&#8208;C12, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP&#8208;counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of CX4&#8208;Cn for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (&lt;b&gt;CX4-C&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and their application as efficient counterion activators for membrane transport of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). The enhanced membrane activity is confirmed with the carboxyfluorescein (CF) assay in vesicles and by the direct cytosolic delivery of CPPs into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC-1 cells enabling excellent cellular uptake of the CPPs into two cancer cell lines. Intracellular delivery was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after CPP entry into live cells mediated by &lt;b&gt;CX4-C&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure-activity relationships for calixarene-based counterion activators and show that &lt;b&gt;CX4-C&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, &lt;b&gt;CX4-C12&lt;/b&gt;, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP-counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of &lt;b&gt;CX4-C&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP-conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy for Constructing Porous Boron and Nitrogen Co&#8208;Doped Carbon as an Efficient ORR Electrocatalyst toward Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to construct porous N and B doped carbon materials (BCN&#8208;P) as efficient metal&#8208;free ORR catalysts for zinc&#8208;air battery, which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as nitrogen and boron sources. BCN&#8208;P exhibits better ORR catalytic activity than its single dopant counterpart, and even comparable to Pt/C in zinc&#8208;air battery performance.







Abstract
Carbon nanomaterials doped with N and B could activate nearby carbon atoms to promote charge polarization through the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, thus facilitating adsorption of O2 and weakening O&#8722;O bond to enhance oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, a simple and controllable self&#8208;assembly strategy is applied to synthesize porous B, N co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;based catalysts (BCN&#8208;P), which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) as nitrogen source, and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as boron source. In addition, polystyrene microspheres are added to help introduce porous structure to expose more active sites. Benefitting from porous structures and the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, BCN&#8208;P has a high onset potential (Eonset=0.846&#8197;V) and half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.74&#8197;V) in alkaline media. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with BCN&#8208;P shows high operating voltage (1.42&#8197;V), peak power density (128.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable charge/discharge cycles, which is even comparable with Pt/C.

         <title>Not All Binding Sites Are Equal: Site Determination and Folding State Analysis of Gas&#8208;Phase Protein&#8208;Metallodrug Adducts</title>

Mass spectrometric studies showed that the anticancer agent RAPTA&#8208;C binds most effectively to ubiquitin and myoglobin over cytochrome c and lysozyme via coordination to His and/or Met residues. While coordination of [Ru(cym)] to ubiquitin at Met1 caused a large compaction of the native&#8208;like protein, [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts had negligible effects, as also observed for myoglobin.







Abstract
Modern approaches in metallodrug research focus on compounds that bind protein targets rather than DNA. However, the identification of protein targets and binding sites is challenging. Using intact mass spectrometry and proteomics, we investigated the binding of the antimetastatic agent RAPTA&#8208;C to the model proteins ubiquitin, cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin. Binding to cytochrome c and lysozyme was negligible. However, ubiquitin bound up to three Ru moieties, two of which were localized at Met1 and His68 as [Ru(cym)], and [Ru(cym)] or [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts, respectively. Myoglobin bound up to four [Ru(cym)(PTA)] moieties and five sites were identified at His24, His36, His64, His81/82 and His113. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding (CIU) studies via ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry allowed measuring protein folding as a function of collisional activation. CIU of protein&#8211;RAPTA&#8208;C adducts showed binding of [Ru(cym)] to Met1 caused a significant compaction of ubiquitin, likely from N&#8208;terminal S&#8722;Ru&#8722;N chelation, while binding of [Ru(cym)(PTA)] to His residues of ubiquitin or myoglobin induced a smaller effect. Interestingly, the folded state of ubiquitin formed by His functionalization was more stable than Met1 metalation. The data suggests that selective metalation of amino acids at different positions on the protein impacts the conformation and potentially the biological activity of anticancer compounds.

         <title>Identification of the Cirratiomycin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in Streptomyces Cirratus: Elucidation of the Biosynthetic Pathways for 2,3&#8208;Diaminobutyric Acid and Hydroxymethylserine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>

The cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces cirratus by genome sequencing and gene inactivation. The biosynthesis of two nonproteinogenic amino acids was elucidated: (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (DABA) is synthesized from threonine by four enzymes, CirQ, CirR, CirS and CirB, and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine (HMSer) is synthesized from d&#8208;serine by CirH.







Abstract
Cirratiomycin, a heptapeptide with antibacterial activity, was isolated and characterized in 1981; however, its biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated. It contains several interesting nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid ((2S,3S)&#8208;DABA) and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine, as building blocks. Here, we report the identification of a cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several Streptomyces viridifaciens and Kitasatospora aureofaciens strains also have this cluster. One S. viridifaciens strain was confirmed to produce cirratiomycin. The biosynthetic gene cluster was shown to be responsible for cirratiomycin biosynthesis in S. cirratus in a gene inactivation experiment using CRISPR&#8208;cBEST. Interestingly, this cluster encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) composed of 12 proteins, including those with an unusual domain organization: a stand&#8208;alone adenylation domain, two stand&#8208;alone condensation domains, two type II thioesterases, and two NRPS modules that have no adenylation domain. Using heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA: (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA is synthesized from l&#8208;threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine from d&#8208;serine in&#8197;vitro. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Azetidine&#8208;Containing Small Macrocyclic Peptides</title>

Incorporation of a 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) into peptide backbones improves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclizations compared to unmodified peptides. The azetidine nitrogen can be readily functionalized using substitution or click chemistry. Crystal structure analysis reveals that a 3&#8208;AAz modified cyclic tetrapeptide adopts an uncommon all&#8208;trans conformation. The 3&#8208;AAz provides stability to protease degradation compared to the unmodified macrocycle.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are increasingly important structures in drugs but their development can be impeded by difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here, we introduce the 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) subunit as a new turn&#8208;inducing element for the efficient synthesis of small head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclic peptides. Greatly improved cyclizations of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexapeptides (28 examples) under standard reaction conditions are achieved by introduction of this element within the linear peptide precursor. Post&#8208;cyclization deprotection of the amino acid side chains with strong acid is realized without degradation of the strained four&#8208;membered azetidine. A special feature of this chemistry is that further late&#8208;stage modification of the resultant macrocyclic peptides can be achieved via the 3&#8208;AAz unit. This is done by: (i) chemoselective deprotection and substitution at the azetidine nitrogen, or by (ii) a click&#8208;based approach employing a 2&#8208;propynyl carbamate on the azetidine nitrogen. In this way, a range of dye and biotin tagged macrocycles are readily produced. Structural insights gained by XRD analysis of a cyclic tetrapeptide indicate that the azetidine ring encourages access to the less stable, all&#8208;trans conformation. Moreover, introduction of a 3&#8208;AAz into a representative cyclohexapeptide improves stability towards proteases compared to the homodetic macrocycle.

         <title>[Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)]: Equilibrium, Dissociation Kinetic and Structural Differences in a Simple Homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (Prohance&#174;)</title>

The minor structural variation arising in [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)] from homologation of a coordination side arm of the clinically employed MRI contrast agent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) does not influence its overall general structure but significantly affects its dynamic properties.







Abstract
[Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) as an active compound of ProHance&#174; is a widely employed contrast agent in clinical MRI scans in the last 30&#8197;years. Recent concerns about the long&#8208;term retention of gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) led to a deeper investigation of the structural features underlying the integrity of the paramagnetic metal complex. Several human and nonclinical studies have noted marked differences among the macrocyclic GBCAs, with the least retention of Gd traces and most rapid elimination consistently being reported for [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)]. It was deemed of interest to assess how minor structural/electronic changes associated to the ligand structure may affect basic properties of the metal complex with several [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] analogues synthesized and characterized in the last years. We recently reported that the closest homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)], i.&#8201;e.: [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], in which a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pendant arm is replaced by a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;butyl moiety, showed a significantly different retention behaviour in the model interaction with collagen, despite the apparently very minor structural difference. In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties of [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], compared to the parent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] and to other closely related macrocyclic GBCAs to assess whether very minor structural changes can modulate the physico&#8208;chemical properties of Gd3+ complexes.

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculation predict double and single M&#246;bius aromaticity in the global minimum geometries of Rh2B2 and RhB2&#8722; clusters. Heavier analogue Ir2B2 follows the same type of aromaticity, albeit being non&#8208;planar. Aromaticity of these clusters have been confirmed by various analysis.







Abstract
Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n&#8197;electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8722; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.

Abstract
We have prepared and characterized three coordination polymers formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with X=Br (2) and Cl (3), where fma=formamide and C6O4X22&#8722;=3,6&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone dianion with X=Cl (chloranilato) and Br (bromanilato). Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with slow and fast precipitation methods, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural and only differ in the X group of the anilato ligand. The three compounds present (6,3)&#8208;gon two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal honey&#8208;comb structures. Magnetic measurements indicate that the three compounds show slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures when a continuous magnetic field is applied, although with different relaxation times and energy barriers depending on X and the crystallisation molecules. Compounds 1&#8211;3 represent the first examples of anilato&#8208;based lattices with formamide and field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of the magnetization.

         <title>Leveraging Pyrazolium Ylide Reactivity to Access Indolizine and 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, transition metal&#8208;free method to synthesize indolizines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidines from pyrazolium ylides is presented. The reaction of pyrazolium ylides with alkynes follows an N&#8208;deletion mechanism to afford indolizines, while reaction with isocyanates follows a rearrangement into a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidine.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic ylides are important synthetic precursors to rapidly build molecular complexity. Pyrazolium ylides have largely been unexplored, and we demonstrate their diverse utility in this report. We show that these readily accessible building blocks can be used to construct different heterocyclic skeletons by varying the coupling partner. Indolizines can be formed via an N&#8208;deletion type mechanism when reacting pyrazolium salts with electron deficient alkynes. 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidines can be formed via a rearrangement mechanism when reacting pyrazolium ylides with isocyanates. These reactions enable access to valuable heteroarenes without the need for transition metal catalysis, high temperatures, or strong bases.

         <title>Incorporation of Carboxylate Pendant Arms into 18&#8208;Membered Macrocycles: Effects on [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelators based on an 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic unit form very stable Pb(II) complexes from the thermodynamic point of view. The studies performed with [203Pb]Pb(II) show that the fluxionality of the complexes is a key factor that needs to be considered for the development of Pb(II)&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) with chelators H4PYTA and H4CHX&#8208;PYTA. These chelators belong to the family of ligands derived from the 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone PYAN and present varying degrees of rigidity due to the presence of either ethyl or cyclohexyl spacers. A complete study of the stable Pb(II) complexes is carried out via NMR, X&#8208;Ray crystallography, stability constant determination and computational studies. While these studies indicated that Pb(II) complexation is achieved, and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting complexes is very high, a certain degree of fluxionality does exist in both cases. Nevertheless, radiolabeling studies were carried out using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) compatible isotope lead&#8208;203 (203Pb, t1/2=51.9&#8197;h), and while both chelators complex the radioisotope, the incorporation of carboxylate pendant arms appears to be detrimental towards the stability of the complexes when compared to the previously described amide analogues. Additionally, incorporation of a cyclohexyl spacer does not improve the kinetic inertness of the system.

         <title>Eight&#8208;Electron Copper Nanoclusters for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise Cu54 nanoclusters with eight free valence electrons have been prepared, characterized, and structurally determined. The clusters show high performance in the field of photothermal conversion. For the first time, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are proved to be effective in photothermal application, which may stimulate the research on using copper nanoclusters in material sciences.







Abstract
Owing to distinct physicochemical properties in comparison to gold and silver counterparts, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are attracting embryonic interest in material science. The introduction of copper cluster nanomaterials in more interesting fields is currently urgent and desired. Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] (X=S or none, tBuSH=2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three&#8208;shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu14@Cl12@Cu40. Interestingly, the [SCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight&#8208;electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71&#8201;&#176;C within ~50&#8197;s, &#955;ex=445&#8197;nm, 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near&#8208;infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilization.

         <title>Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts Acylation of [11C]Isocyanates Enabling the Radiolabeling of [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a radiolabeling method for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams using the PET nuclide carbon&#8208;11. The labeling reactions utilize widely available [11C]CO2 and amine precursors in a quick, robust and automatable one&#8208;pot reaction. The reaction showed a broad substrate scope and was applied to produce the otherwise inaccessible PARP inhibitor tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ, meeting the quality requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams are highly abundant in biologically active molecules, yet so far they cannot be radiolabeled with short&#8208;lived (t1/2=20.3&#8197;min), &#946;+&#8208;decaying carbon&#8208;11, which has prevented their application as positron emission tomography tracers.

This method proceeds via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of in&#8197;situ formed [11C]isocyanates and shows a broad substrate scope for the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings. We implemented our developed labeling method for the radiosynthesis of the potential PARP1 PET tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ in a clinical radiotracer production facility following the standards of the European Pharmacopoeia.

Temperature and pressure dependence of the glycolytic G6PDH reaction forming NADPH/PLL droplets as the enzymatic reaction proceeds: Incorporation of the reactants in the droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures.







Abstract
Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate to 6&#8208;phospho&#8208;D&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation. Here, the nucleotide serves as substrate as well as the scaffold required for the formation of liquid droplets. To further expand the process parameter space, temperature and pressure dependent measurements were performed. Incorporation of the reactants in the liquid droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures. The crowded environment of the droplet phase induced a marked increase of the affinity of the enzyme and substrate. An increase in turnover number in the droplet phase at high pressure contributed to a further strong increase in catalytic efficiency. Enzyme systems that are dynamically coupled to liquid condensate formation may be the key to deciphering many biochemical reactions. Expanding the process parameter space by adjusting temperature and pressure conditions can be a means to further increase the efficiency of industrial enzyme utilization and help uncover regulatory mechanisms adopted by extremophiles.

Ab initio coupled cluster calculations has identified double M&#246;bius aromaticity in planar neutral four&#8208;membered D2h&#8208;symmetric Rh2B2 and single M&#246;bius three&#8208;membered C2V&#8208;symmetric Rh2B&#8208; rings.

Two hands holding a molecule hint at chirality, which exists in three dimensions from the macro&#8208; to the micro&#8208;world. A new type of chirality is generated by rotating three functional groups to different orientations along an axis. An energy curve shows that there are three relatively stable conformations. Beams of light show the molecules can provide polarized light for future research and applications in materials science. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Jiao, G.

Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode with enlarged surface area, enough spacing, and the shortened ions/electrons transporting path length would greatly facilitate the rapid kinetics and promote more Li ions reversibly stored in the Ge electrode during cycling, thus embrace improved energy&amp;power density and cyclability. This review highlights various strategies of constructing the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode and provides future perspectives.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high&#8208;performance binder&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional (3D) self-supported Ge anode with enlarged surface area, enough spacing, and the shortened ions/electrons transporting path length would greatly facilitate the rapid kinetics and promote more Li ions reversibly stored in the Ge electrode during cycling, thus embrace improved energy&amp;amp;power density and cyclability. This review highlights various strategies of constructing the 3D self-supported Ge anode and provides future perspectives.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional (3D) self-supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high-performance binder-free lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shortened ions/electrons transporting distance of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self-supported Ge electrode would be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self-supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self-supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge-based electrodes in energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8211;Driven Self&#8211;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymers, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures.







Abstract
With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8211;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.

Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR has opened the door to probing the structures of protein in&#8197;situ at atomic resolution. Here we discuss the methodologies&#8217; state of the art, current bottlenecks, and present possible solutions to the latter ranging from application of novel biochemical approaches to purely spectroscopic considerations.







Abstract
Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR is emerging as a powerful technique for probing the structural properties of conformationally homogenous and heterogenous biomolecular species irrespective of size at atomic resolution within their native environments. Herein we detail advancements that have made acquiring such data, specifically within the confines of intact bacterial and eukaryotic cell a reality and further discuss the type of structural information that can presently be garnered by the technique's exploitation. Subsequently, we discuss bottlenecks that have thus far curbed cellular DNP&#8208;ssNMR's broader adoption namely due a lack of sensitivity and spectral resolution. We also explore possible solutions ranging from utilization of new pulse sequences, design of better performing polarizing agents, and application of additional biochemical/ cell biological methodologies.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Spin Regulation in Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, magnetic fields have been regarded as an effective tool to modify magnetic domain structure and change the spin multiplicity of electrons during the electrocatalysis process. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent development of spin regulation induced by the magnetic field in electrocatalysis. Finally, we point out the challenges and perspectives in spin&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of a magnetic field to manipulate spin states has emerged as a novel approach to enhance efficiency in electrocatalytic reactions, distinguishing from traditional strategies that focus on tuning activation energy barriers. Currently, this approach is specifically tailored to reactions where spin states change during the catalytic process, such as the oxidation of singlet H2O to triplet O2. In the magnetically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) procedure, the parallel spin alignment on the ferromagnetic catalyst was induced by the external magnetic field, facilitating the triplet O&#8722;O bonding, which is the rate limiting step in OER. This review centers on recent advancements in harnessing external magnetic fields to enhance OER performance, delving into mechanistic approaches for this magnetic promotion. Additionally, we provide a summary of magnetic field application in other electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Thio and Seleno&#8208; Psoralens as Efficient Triplet Harvesting Photosensitizers For Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Psoralen (Pso) molecule finds extensive applications in photo&#8208;chemotherapy, courtesy of its triplet state forming ability. Sulfur and selenium replacement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen of organic chromophores foster efficient triplet harvesting with near unity triplet quantum yield. These triplet&#8208;forming photosensitizers are useful in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) applications for selective apoptosis of cancer cells. In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin&#8208;orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&#8208;5 s for Pso to 10&#8208;8 s for TPso and 10&#8208;9 s for SePso. The intramolecular photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by these exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115 GM of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8208;1050 nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.</dc:description>

In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet-triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin-orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10-5 s for Pso to 10-8 s for TPso and 10-9 s for SePso. The intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by these exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115 GM of two-photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660-1050 nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Sequential Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems for Constructing White LED Device and Latent Fingerprint Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interaction in water and its applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging. The host&#8208;guest complex WP5&#11815;G self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles in water and shows enhanced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The nanoparticles can be further used to construct sequential LHS with fluorescent dyes 4,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DBT) and sulforhodamine 101 (SR101). Impressively, the system shows white&#8208;light emission when the molar ratio of WP5&#11815;G/DBT/SR101 is 1100/2/16. The material can be coated on a LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit color&#8208;tunable fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high&#8208;resolution imaging of latent fingerprints. Therefore, we demonstrated a general strategy for the construction of sequential LHS in water based on macrocyclic host&#8208;guest interaction and explored its multi&#8208;functional applications in white&#8208;light LED device and imaging of latent fingerprints, which will promote future development and application of supramolecular LHSs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Approach of Electrocatalytic Deamination from Aromatic Amide to Diarylimide on Ni&#8208;PTFE Modified Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hydrophobic Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode has been prepared by constant current and cathodic electroplating with a nickel sheet as substrate in a PTFE suspension. Then the Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode was used for electroreduction from aromatic amide to diarylimide. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammogram, EIS, polarization curves, and electrode stability have been carried out by electrochemical workstation. The structure of the electroreduction product diarylimide was characterized by 1HNMR, FT&#8208;IR, MS(Mass Spectrum), and EA(Elemental Analyzer). Based on the hydrophobicity of the electrode, an approach suggested that the phenyl ketone radical may be formed by electroreductive deamination at the cathode. With the construction of C&#8208;N bond by the radical coupling, the electrocatalytic reduction may be comprised of a one&#8208;electron process including an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The electroreduction of aromatic amide to diarylimide may be controlled by both charge migration and concentration polarization. Electrocatalytic reduction of aromatic amides on Ni&#8208;PTFE&#8208;modified electrodes is all well conversion ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA by Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both tight and specific binding of folded biological mRNA is required for gene silencing by oligonucleotide gene therapy agents. However, this is fundamentally impossible using the conventional oligonucleotide probes according to the affinity/specificity dilemma. This study addresses this problem by using multicomponent agents (dubbed &#8216;DNA nanomachine&#8217; or DNM) for RNA binding. DNMs bind RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensures tight and highly selective RNA binding. Along with the improved affinity, DNM maintained the high sequence selectivity of the conventional DNAzymes. DNM enabled up to 3&#8208;fold improvement in DNAzymes catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by facilitating both RNA substrate binding and product release steps of the catalytic cycle. This study demonstrates that multicomponent probes organized in sophisticated structures can help to achieve the balance between affinity and selectivity in recognizing folded RNA and thus creates a foundation for applying complex DNA nanostructures in gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Coumarin&#8208;Based Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Blue Emitters for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the "hot excitons" channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7P), 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7M), and 6&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7&#8208;position and the substituent at C3&#8208;position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh&#8208;7P, pPh&#8208;7M, and pPh&#8208;6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution&#8208;processed doped OLEDs based on pPh&#8208;6M exhibited deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446 nm, maximum luminance of 8755 cd m&#8208;2, maximum current efficiency of 5.83 cd A&#8208;1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54%. The results reveal that pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components has better OLED performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To meet the demand for higher energy density in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and expand their application range, coupling lithium metal anodes with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is an ideal solution. However, the compatibility between lithium metal batteries and electrolytes affects their applicability. In this study, proposes a locally concentrated electrolyte based on ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the lithium salt, and lithium difluorooxoborate (LiDFOB) as a sacrificial agent to enhance the low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage endurance of Li//Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) batteries. The Li//LCO battery can operate within the voltage range of 3 to 4.5 V, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 174.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 oC. At &#8208;40 oC, after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 87.7%. It can operate under extreme conditions of &#8208;70 oC, with a discharge specific capacity of 112.6 mAh g&#8208;1. Additionally, LCO//HC batteries using this electrolyte demonstrate excellent performance. Present work provides a new perspective for the optimization of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature Products Chlorophyll Derivatives for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging and Plant&#8208;imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000 &#8208; 1700 nm) fluorescence imaging has attracted significant attention in research fields because of its unique advantages compared with conventional optical windows (400 &#8211; 900 nm). A variety of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores have been actively studied because they serve as a key component of fluorescence imaging. Among them, organic small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores display outstanding imaging performance and many advantages, but types of small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with high biocompatibility are still quite limited. Novel molecular scaffolds based NIR&#8208;II dyes are highly desired. Herein, we hypothesized that chlorophyll is a new promising molecular platform for discovery NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. Thus, seven derivatives of derivatives were selected to characterize their optical properties. Interestingly, six chlorophyll derivatives displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability. This characteristic allowed the successful NIR&#8208;II imaging of green leaves of various plants. Furthermore, most of these fluorophores showed capacity to monitor viscosity change because of their sensitive for viscosity. For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time LSPR&#8208;based study of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MOFs are known for their absorption properties and widely used for accumulation, filtering, sensorics, photothermal, catalytical and other applications. Their combination with plasmonic metal nanoparticles leads to hybrid structures that profit from the stabilizing effect and high porosity of the MOF as well as the optical and electronic properties of the nanoparticles. The growth of MOFs on plasmonic nanoparticles can be monitored in&#8208;situ using LSPR spectroscopy, simultaneously applying microfluidic reaction conditions for the fabrication of NP@MOF structures. Here, a systematic study is conducted using LSPR spectroscopy for the monitoring of the Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer deposition of twelve different MOFs, determining the suitability of LSPR spectroscopy for this purpose. In addition to some well&#8208;investigated materials like HKUST&#8208;1, other MOFs such as MIL&#8208;53, MIL&#8208;88A and Cu&#8208;BDC are deposited successfully. For some MOFs such as Zn&#8208;Fum, the LSPR experiment indicates that no deposition had taken place. The results are confirmed with AFM, SEM and XPS measurements. This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in&#8208;situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include optimization of the synthesis process or transfer to other materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni Single Atom Decorated Porous Hollow Carbon Nanosphere&#8208;Based Electrodes for High Performance Symmetric Solid&#8208;State Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni single atom containing hollow carbon nanospheres with nitrogen doping has been synthesized by carbonization of Ni(NO3)2/phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde polymer/silica composite. The samples have been characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, electron microscopic, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The microstructure and surface area vary with the amount of Ni(NO3)2 employed in the syntheses and the carbonization environment. An optimized amount of nickel and argon as the carbonization gas afford Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar which possesses overall superior features. The uniformly dispersed Ni single atoms within the hollow porous carbon framework fully utilize all the electroactive sites thereby improving the supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar reaches 777 F&#8729;g&#8208;1 at 1 A&#8729;g&#8208;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.4% and excellent recyclability. The energy and power density of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar are found to be high; at 1 A&#8729;g&#8208;1 its energy density is 155.4 Wh&#8729;kg&#8208;1 with a power density of 600.3 W&#8729;kg&#8208;1. At a high current density of 10 A&#8729;g&#8208;1 the material shows a high energy density of 118.4 Wh&#8729;kg&#8208;1 with excellent power density of 6003.4 W&#8729;kg&#8208;1. A symmetric solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with this material, Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar//Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar using H2SO4/PVA gel electrolyte shows a superior energy density value of 30 Wh&#8729;kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 1200 W&#8729;kg&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions on photoluminescent response in the (Bu4N)2{[Pt(bph)(CN)2][phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol]} framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tunable photoluminescence (PL) is one of the hot topics in current materials science, and research performed on the molecular phases is at the forefront of this field. We present the new (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#183;rez3&#183;1/3H2O (Pt2rez3) (bph = biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diyl; rez3 = 3,3&#8221;,5,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8221;&#8208;terphenyl,&#160;phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol coformer, a linear quaternary hydrogen bond donor) co&#8208;crystal salt based on the recently appointed promising [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; luminophore. Within the extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded subnetwork [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes and rez3 coformer molecules form two types of contacts: the&#160; rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Ncomplex ones in the equatorial plane of the complex and non&#8208;typical rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt ones along its axial direction. The combined structural, PL, and DFT approach distinguished the rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons to promote the noticeable uniform redshift of bph ligand centered (LC) emission compared to the LC emission of (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#183;H2O (Pt2) precursor owing to the direct interference of the phenol group into the PtII&#8208;bph orbital system via altering the CT processes. The high&#8208;resolution emission spectra for Pt2 and Pt2rez3 were successfully reproduced at 77 K by using the Franck&#8208;Cordon expressions. The possibility to tune PL properties along the plausible continuum of rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons is indicated, considering various scenarios of molecular occupation of the space above and below the complex plane.</dc:description>

The combined structural, PL, and DFT approach distinguished the rez3O-H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons to promote the noticeable uniform redshift of bph ligand centered (LC) emission compared to the LC emission of (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#183;H2O (Pt2) precursor owing to the direct interference of the phenol group into the PtII-bph orbital system via altering the CT processes. The high-resolution emission spectra for Pt2 and Pt2rez3 were successfully reproduced at 77 K by using the Franck-Cordon expressions. The possibility to tune PL properties along the plausible continuum of rez3O-H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons is indicated, considering various scenarios of molecular occupation of the space above and below the complex plane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;lying LUMO Boosts Conductance in Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalene Versus Aromatic Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, but the study of molecular wires incorporating antiaromatic units is limited. Despite initial predictions, very few studies show that antiaromaticity has a beneficial effect on electron transport. Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a stable structure that displays appreciable antiaromaticity within the five&#8208;membered rings of the pentalene core. We have investigated derivatives of DBP furnished with pyridyl (Py) and F4&#8208;pyridyl (PyF4) anchor groups, and compared the conductance with purely aromatic phenyl and anthracene analogues. We find that the low&#8208;bias conductance of DBP&#8208;Py is approximately 60% larger than that of the anthracene analogue Anth&#8208;Py and 250% larger compared to the phenyl derivative Ph&#8208;Py. This is due to a better alignment of the LUMO with the gold Fermi level, which we confirm by conductance&#8208;voltage spectroscopy where the conductance of DBP&#8208;Py shows the greatest voltage&#8208;dependence. The F4&#8208;pyridyl compounds, which have lower LUMO energies compared to the pyridyl analogues, did not, however, form detectable molecular junctions. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the donor capability of the nitrogen lone&#8208;pair to the point where stable N&#8208;Au bonds no longer form</dc:description>

         <title>Backbone Modification in a Protein Hydrophobic Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein backbone modification can recreate tertiary structures reminiscent of folds found in nature on artificial scaffolds with improved biostability. Incorporation of altered monomers in such entities is typically limited to sites distant from the hydrophobic core to avoid potential disruptions to folding. This is limiting, as it is advantageous in some applications to incorporate artificial connectivity at buried sites. Here, we report an examination of protein backbone modification targeted specifically to hydrophobic core positions and its impacts on tertiary folded structure and fold stability. Different artificial monomer types are placed at core, core&#8208;flanking, or solvent&#8208;exposed positions in a compact three&#8208;helix protein. Effects on structure and folding energetics are assessed by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. Results show that artificial residues can be well accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a defined tertiary fold, with effects on stability only modestly larger than identical changes at solvent&#8208;exposed sites. Collectively, these results provide new insights into folding behavior of protein&#8208;like artificial chains as well as strategies for the design of such molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusually short H&#183;&#183;&#183;H contacts in intramolecularly cyclized helically fused anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular coupling of dichloro&#8208;substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X&#8208;ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692 &#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5 ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high&#8208;frequency shift of the C&#8211;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl&#8208;substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84 kJ mol&#8722;1. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Guerbet Reaction by Metal Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Guerbet reaction is important for the synthesis of longer&#8208;chain monoalcohols like isobutanol through catalytic transfer hydrogenation from short&#8208;chain methanol and ethanol. However, the mechanism becomes complicated, especially considering the variations in the different metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) catalysts used. In order to further understand the Guerbet reaction, DFT studies were performed to figure out the detailed mechanism initiated by the unique Mn&#8208;PCP MLC Catalyst. Our results suggest that even with the assistance of the carbanion site of the PCP ligand, the direct substitution mechanism is less favored than the condensation&#8208;reduction mechanism. The key step of the reaction is the final reduction of the carbonyl, in which the 1,4&#8208;reduction of the unsaturated aldehyde is prior to the 3,4&#8208;reduction or 1,2&#8208;reduction due to the stronger interaction between the catalyst and the substrate. It is found that the production of isobutanol is preferred over n&#8208;butanol because of the lower total free energy barrier and lower relative free energy of the product. Finally, by changing the electronic effect of the carbanion site of the catalyst, we found that the relation between the electronic effect and the highest free energy span was not monotonous and a point with optimal electronic effect exists numerically.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered Phase Transition of Crystals and Photoactuation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a new type of phase transition in which a photochromic crystal with a thermal phase transition transforms into an identical high&#8208;temperature phase in a temperature region lower than the thermal phase transition temperature upon light irradiation. Here, we report a second crystal that exhibits a photo&#8208;triggered phase transition, thereby demonstrating that the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a general phenomenon that occurs in crystals. When the chiral salicylidenephenylethylamine crystal was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light, the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition occurred in the temperature range &#8211;30 to &#8211;10&#176;C. The photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is induced by local stress due to trans&#8208;keto molecules produced by photoisomerization near the irradiated surface. Crystal cantilevers exhibited stepwise bending by the combination of the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition and photoisomerization. Alternate irradiation with UV and visible light achieved locomotion of single crystals driven by repeated stepwise bending. Finally, a detailed comparison of photo&#8208;triggered and non&#8208;photo&#8208;triggered phase transition crystals revealed that a sufficient molecular conformation change in affordable crystal voids, smooth photoisomerization, and most likely a chiral molecular arrangement are required for inducing the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition.</dc:description>

Finally, a detailed comparison of photo-triggered and non-photo-triggered phase transition crystals revealed that a sufficient molecular conformation change in affordable crystal voids, smooth photoisomerization, and most likely a chiral molecular arrangement are required for inducing the photo-triggered phase transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Mediated Electronic Structure Modulation in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene&#8208;based COFs with abundant donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well&#8208;modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#160;mmol g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;by the protonated quinoline&#8208;linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that&#160;multiple modifications toward linkage&#160;synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8208;A effect, making TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3&#160;a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration.&#160;This study provides important guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation&#160;in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline CdS/amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) under a wide potential window of 1.0 V, with the highest value reaching ~100% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16 V to &#8722;2.46 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76 V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocycle&#8208; and Amine&#8208;Free Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Molecules for Energy&#8208;Saving See&#8208;Through Smart Windows and Displays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochromic (EC) smart windows are an elegant alternative to dusty curtains, blinds, and traditional dimming devices. The EC energy storage smart windows and displays received remarkable attention in the optoelectronic industry as they hold promise for high energy efficiency, low power consumption, reversibility, and swift response to stimuli. However, achieving these properties remains challenging. Moreover, most EC molecules do not exhibit electrofluorochromism, which is highly essential for smart displays because its EC property can modulate the solar heat entering the building, and its electrofluorochromic (EFC) aspects can create lighting during the night. In this work, a structure&#8208;property relationship is utilized to develop new electrochromes that can store the injected charge, and these molecules indeed exhibit electrofluorochromism. The compounds are synthesized from tetrabenzofluorene with two aromatic acceptor units, and avoids the use of widely studied heterocycles and amine derivatives. The electrochromes switches from yellow to dark hue in solution, solid, and gel state. The compounds display exceptional electrochemical stability and reversibility in 1000 cycles and capacity retention of 93&#8208;100% in 300 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device fabrication of the self&#8208;dimming EC smart window presented here demonstrates that it can furnish visual comfort, modulate transmitted light and glare, and reduce energy usage.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Diselenophosphoric Acids for Ion Pair Catalysis: A Novel Approach to Enhance Both Proton Donating and Proton Accepting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of poorly reactive substrates via strong chiral acids is a central topic in asymmetric ion pair catalysis these days. Despite highly successful scaffolds such as N&#8208;triflylphosphoramides, these catalysts either lack C2&#8208;symmetry or provide multiple H&#8208;bond acceptor sites, leading to lower ee values for certain reactions. We present BINOL&#8208;based diselenophosphoric acids (DSA) as an extremely promising alternative. Using an intertwined approach of synthesis and NMR studies, we developed a synthetic approach to DSA with up to 98% NMR yield. The obtained acids provide both very high proton donor and proton acceptor properties, a bifunctionality, which is key to catalytic applications. Indeed, first reactivity test proved the much higher acidity of DSA and its ability to initiate Mukaiyama&#8211;Mannich reaction and protodesilylation of silyl ethers. Together with their C2&#8208;symmetry, the single donor and single acceptor situation, the decreased tendency of self&#8208;association, and the straightforward synthesis with potential 3,3&#8217;&#8208;substitution, the DSA provide all features ideal for the further development of ion pair catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Phosphorescent Emission Modulated by Clipping of Metallotweezers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials have received significant attention due to their potential applications in bioimaging and diagnostics. Although, many types of organic phosphors with near&#8208;infrared emission have been developed, the low phosphorescence efficiency in aqueous solution hampers their practical applications in biological systems. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials with high emission efficiency in aqueous media. Metallotweezers, based on d8 transition metal complexes, emerge as the potential candidates for realizing this objective. Specifically, metallotweezers, featuring two positively charged platinum(II) terpyridine and neutral gold(III) diphenylpyridine pincers on diphenylpyridine spacer, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. The pre&#8208;organization effect, rendered by the rigid spacer, enables the resulting metallotweezers to complex with each other, resulting in the formation of clipping complex. The synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects of clipping structure results in enhanced phosphorescent emission intensity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared phosphorescent materials have received significant attention due to their potential applications in bioimaging and diagnostics. Although, many types of organic phosphors with near-infrared emission have been developed, the low phosphorescence efficiency in aqueous solution hampers their practical applications in biological systems. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop near-infrared phosphorescent materials with high emission efficiency in aqueous media. Metallotweezers, based on d8 transition metal complexes, emerge as the potential candidates for realizing this objective. Specifically, metallotweezers, featuring two positively charged platinum(II) terpyridine and neutral gold(III) diphenylpyridine pincers on diphenylpyridine spacer, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. The pre-organization effect, rendered by the rigid spacer, enables the resulting metallotweezers to complex with each other, resulting in the formation of clipping complex. The synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects of clipping structure results in enhanced phosphorescent emission intensity. Concurrently, due to phase segregation between the clipping units and the polyethylene glycol tail, the clipping complex undergoes self-assembly in aqueous solution, resulting in phosphorescent emission in the near-infrared region. Overall, non-covalent clipping of metallotweezers illustrated in this study presents a new and effective approach toward near-infrared phosphorescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thixotropic Composite Hydrogel Electrode Composed of a Polymer Hydrogelator and Water&#8208;Dispersive Tungsten Oxide Flat Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we introduce an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel as a versatile gel electrode material. This composite hydrogel was formed by simply mixing an aqueous solution of flat microparticles of tungsten oxide, exhibiting superior water dispersibility, with a hydrogel composed of a water&#8208;soluble polyaramide&#8208;based polymer hydrogelator. The resulting composite hydrogel exhibited uniform dispersion of tungsten oxide flat particles throughout the hydrogel matrix, supplementing the structure formed by the polymer hydrogelator. It maintained the gel&#8208;forming capability and thixotropic behavior inherent to the polymer hydrogelator while showcasing the electrochemical characteristics of tungsten oxide. With its spreadability and applicability to various electrode shapes, a composite hydrogel is presented as a potential spreadable gel electrode material.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address key concerns on solid&#8208;state pyrene&#8208;based luminescent materials, we propose a novel and efficient mechanical bond strategy. This strategy results in a transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect and a remarkable enhancement of pyrene emission in the solid state. More importantly, an unusual purification of emission is also achieved. Through computational calculation and experimental characterization, finally determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we prove that the excellent emissions result from the refined molecular arrangements, including reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, well&#8208;ordered packing and enhanced structural stability. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanical bond in the field of organic luminescent molecules, providing a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance organic luminescent materials and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid access to divergent fused polycycles via one&#8208;pot A3 coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems are constructed from simple starting materials via a one&#8208;pot aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. This domino reaction directly furnishes linear 5/5/5 and 5/5/6, or nonlinear 5/5/6/5, polycyclic rings containing an oxa&#8208;bridged fused 5/5 bicycle and a 1,6&#8208;enyne substructure. One&#8208;step derivation of the oxa&#8208;bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back&#8208;to&#8208;back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5&#8208;membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one&#8208;pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non&#8208;biological activities or functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Photochemistry in Aromatic Dithioimides: Quantitative Thione Reduction Promoted by Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a mechanistic investigation of an aromatic dithioimide (2SS) displaying puzzling yet efficient photochemistry in ether solvents. Perplexingly, 2SS dissolved in ether solvents in a sealed and degassed vial was photochemically converted to the corresponding diimide (2OO), as determined by 1H NMR following product extraction. With no external sources of oxygen in the sample, could the oxygen in 2OO be from the ether itself? To study this unprecedented proposition, we attempt to uncover the ether&#8217;s involvement in this reaction. As seen by laser&#8208;flash photolysis, 2SS appears to first react with the solvent from its singlet excited state. Following the reaction by NMR under rigorously oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;free conditions led to the identification of a photoreductive pathway that quantitatively transformed one thione into a methylene to yield 2SH2. Subsequent oxidation of 2SH2 or irradiation of 2SS under air proved that molecular oxygen was indeed necessary to observe an oxidative pathway leading to 2OO, ruling out the initially proposed involvement of an ether oxygen. An explanation of 2SS desulfurization was further revealed through the study of solvent by&#8208;products by GC&#8208;MS analysis. Supported by DFT calculations, a mechanism is proposed to involve a chain reaction initiated by photochemically generated ether radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Role of a Novel heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2&#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475 nm &#8232;(&#949; = 4500 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin-2&#8217;-one-1,2,3-triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2-diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475 nm &lt;/br&gt;(&#949; = 4500 M-1cm-1), which is assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin-2&#8217;-one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo-driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo-driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)-porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge-accumulation properties, the non-innocent benzoquinoxalin-2-one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)-based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Comparative Studies Revealing the Contribution of TADF Activity of Organic Emitters Towards Efficient Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties has attracted considerable interest, showcasing their potential for 100% exciton harvesting, which marks a significant advancement in the realm of organic ECL. However, the challenge of elucidating the precise contribution of TADF to the enhanced ECL efficiency arises due to the lack of comparative studies of organic compounds with or without efficient TADF properties. In this study, we present four carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile (Cz&#8208;BN) molecules possessing similar chemical structures and comparable exchange energy (&#916;EST). Despite their comparable properties, these compounds exhibited varying TADF efficiencies, warranting a closer examination of their underlying structural and electronic characteristics governing the optical properties. Consequently, intense ECL emission was only observed from 4CzBN with a remarkable TADF efficiency, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL signal among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly growing discipline that is expected to become an encouraging noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In the PDT process, an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) process for photosensitizers from the singlet excited state (S1) to the triplet excited state (T1) is critical for the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and improvement of PDT performance. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules featuring an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and an efficient ISC process represent an enormous breakthrough for the PDT process. Consequently, the development of advanced TADF photosensitizers has become increasingly crucial and pressing. The most recent developments in TADF photosensitizers aimed at enhancing PDT efficiency for bio&#8208;applications are presented in this review. TADF photosensitizers with water dispersibility, targeting ability, activatable ability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties are highlighted. Furthermore, the future challenges and perspectives of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Analysis of (+)&#8208;Germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol Using the Crystalline Sponge Method to Elucidate the Origin of its Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsaturated cyclic terpenes often exhibit instability due to the proximation of C=C bonds in the cyclic skeleton, leading to nonenzymatic degradation. In this study, the crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a minute amount of oily and cyclic terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol, which was produced by a terpene synthase OILTS under in vitro conditions.&#160; The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of the cyclic terpene with proximal double bonds. Under weakly acidic in vivo conditions, OILTS gave four pseudo&#8208;natural products or artifacts. The CS method also elucidated the structures of these degraded compounds, proposing a degradation mechanism triggered by the transannular reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tridentate Lewis Acids Based on Tribenzotriquinacene Chalices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalice&#8208;shaped tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) scaffold have been synthesised. Stannylation of the alkyne units, attached via phenyl&#8208;spacers to the benzhydrylic positions to the TBTQ scaffold, with Me2NSnMe3 afforded the trimethyltin substituted TBTQ derivative. Replacement of these tin functions with other elements resulted in rigid boron&#8208; and aluminium&#8208;functionalised PLAs. More flexible PLAs were obtained by hydrometallation reactions of the terminal alkyne groups of 4b,8b,12b&#8208;tris((ethy&#173;nyl)phenyl)tribenzotriquinacene. The resulting poly&#8208;Lewis acids were tested for their acceptor abilities in host&#8208;guest experi&#173;ments with suitable bases. Preliminary tests with pyridine led to the synthesis of a large tridentate base with three pyridyl groups attached to a TBTQ backbone. Complexation of this Lewis base with the PLAs resulted in the formation of aggregates, which were studied in solution in more detail by 1H DOSY NMR experiments regarding their size. Further experiments were performed with the tridentate bases 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane and tris((dimethylphosphino)&#173;methyl)&#173;phenyl&#173;si&#173;&#173;lane.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;Sulfenyl Oxazoles from Alkynyl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been achieved. Gold&#8208;catalysed conditions are used to favour the formation of 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles via &#946;&#8208;selective attack of the nitrenoid relative to the sulfenyl group. In contrast, 4&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles are formed by &#945;&#8208;selective reaction under Br&#248;nsted acid conditions from the same substrates. The nature of stabilising gold&#8208;sulfur interactions have been investigated by natural bond orbital analysis, showing that the S&#8594;Au interactions are significantly stronger in the intermediate that favours the 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles. A kinetic survey identifies catalyst inhibition processes. This study into the regiodivergent methods includes the development of telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocols for regioselective access to oxazole sulfoxides and sulfones.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Basicity and Chelate Effects on Sulfur Insertion vs. Sulfur Reduction by Zinc Thiolate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinate zinc thiolate complexes supported either by bis(carboxamide)pyridine frameworks or by substituted tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands react with elemental sulfur (S8) following two distinct pathways. Some zinc thiolate moieties insert sulfur atoms to form zinc polysulfanide complexes, while others reduce sulfur and oxidize the thiolate. Here, we compare the effects of ligand electronics, strain, and sterics for selecting the respective reaction pathway. These results show that chelating and electron&#8208;deficient thiolate ligands better stabilize persistent zinc&#8208;bound polysulfanide species.</dc:description>
