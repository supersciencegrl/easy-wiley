         <title>Effect of Br&#248;nsted Acids on the Activation of Mixed Anhydride/Mixed Carbonic Anhydride and C&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Methylated Peptide Synthesis in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amidations employing mixed (carbonic) anhydrides have long been favoured in peptide synthesis because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness and less waste generation. Despite their long history, no study has compared the effects of additives on the activation of mixed anhydrides and carbonic anhydrides. In this study, we investigated the amidation of mixed (carbonic) anhydride in the presence of a base and/or Br&#248;nsted acids. The use of NMI&#183;HCl significantly improved the conversion of the mixed carbonic anhydride, while expediting nucleophilic attacks on the desired carbonyl group. In contrast, in the case of mixed carbonic anhydrides, neither the conversion nor the desired nucleophilic attack improved significantly. We developed a C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis method using mixed carbonic anhydrides in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. Fourteen N&#8208;alkylated peptides were synthesized in moderate to high yields (55&#8211;99%) without severe racemization (&lt;1%). Additionally, a significant enhancement in the amidation between mixed carbonic anhydrides and bis&#8208;TMS&#8208;protected N&#8208;methyl amino acids with the inclusion of NMI&#183;HCl was observed for the first time. In addition, we observed unexpected C&#8208;terminal epimerization of the C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methyl peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Substrate Channeling with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Architectures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) represent an emerging category of organic structures with high crystallinity and metal&#8208;free, which are not commonly observed in alternative porous organic frameworks. These needle&#8208;like porous structure can help in stabilizing enzymes and allow transfer of molecules between enzymes participating in cascade reactions for enhanced substrate channelling. Herein, we systematically synthesized and investigated the stability of HOF at extreme conditions followed by one&#8208;pot encapsulation of single and bi&#8208;enzyme systems. Firstly, we observed HOF to be stable at pH 1 to 14 and at high temperatures (up to 115&#176;C). Secondly, the encapsulated glucose oxidase enzyme (GOX) showed 80 % and 90% of its original activity at 70 &#176;C and pH 11, respectively. Thirdly, transient time close to 0 seconds was observed for HOF encapsulated bi&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction system demonstrating a 4.25&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity when compared to free enzymes with enhanced substrate channelling. Our findings showcase a facile system synthesized under ambient conditions to encapsulate and stabilize enzymes at extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Stability of an end&#8208;on Superoxido Copper(II) Complex under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superoxido copper complexes play an important role as usually short&#8208;lived intermediates in biology and chemistry. The unusual stability of an&#160;end&#8208;on&#160;superoxido copper complex observed in an oxygen&#8208;enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) led to a detailed mechanistic investigation of the formation of [CuII(Me6tren)(O2&#8226;&#8722;)]+&#160;(Me6tren = tris(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminoethyl)amine) under ambient conditions. The persistence of the superoxido copper complex could be explained by a reaction cycle including the peroxido complex&#160;[(Me6tren)2CuII2(O2)]2+&#160;together with [CuI(Me6tren)(DMSO)]+&#160;and [CuII(Me6tren)(OH)]+&#160;in the overall reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>UoC&#8208;7: A Bimetallic K&#8208;Zn&#8208;MOF with an Anionic Framework Based on Fluorinated Trimesate Ligands Exhibiting a Large CO2 Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solvothermal reactions of Zn(NO3)2&#215;6H2O with K(H2mF&#8208;BTC) or K(H2dF&#8208;BTC) in DMF/ethanol or DMA/ethanol solvent mixtures, single crystals of the MOFs UoC&#8208;7(1F) and UoC&#8208;7(2F) were obtained crystallizing in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no. 176) (H3BTC: 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid; mF&#8208;/dF: mono&#8208;/difluoro; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; DMA: N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide; UoC: University of Cologne). According to the general composition [(CH3)2NH2][K2Zn3(mF&#8208;/dF&#8208;BTC)3(H2O)]&#215;solvent, UoC&#8208;7 consists of an anionic bimetallic framework. The charge is compensated by a (CH3)2NH2+ cation stemming from the (partial) hydrolysis of the solvent. The crystal structure shows large channels along the hexagonal [001] direction, which accommodate the cations as well as solvent molecules. Surface areas (SBET) of 2740 m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(1F)) and 1643 m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(2F)) were obtained from N2 sorption measurements. UoC&#8208;7 shows structural similarities to the MOF NKU&#8208;521 with a 5&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)isophthalate linker. Both MOFs exhibit a 4,7,8T14 topology. Despite smaller channels in UoC&#8208;7 compared to NKU&#8208;521, the CO2 uptake is considerably higher (~164 cm3/g at 1 bar/293 K) being one of the highest CO2 uptakes observed up to now.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Tin Valence in the Tin(II/IV)&#8208;Nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn3P8N16 combines the structural versatility of nitridophosphates and Sn within one compound. It was synthesized as dark gray powder in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 800&#160;&#176;C and 6&#160;GPa from Sn3N4 and P3N5. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group C2/m (no. 12), a&#160;=&#160;12.9664(4), b&#160;=&#160;10.7886(4), c&#160;=&#160;4.8238(2)&#160;&#197;, &#946;&#160;=&#160;109.624(1)&#176;) and shows a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra, incorporating Sn in oxidation states +II and +IV. The Sn cations are located within eight&#8208;membered rings of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra, stacked along the [001] direction. A combination of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations was used to confirm the mixed oxidation of Sn. Temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal a low thermal expansion of 3.6&#160;ppm/K up to 750&#160;&#176;C, beyond which Sn3P8N16 starts to decompose.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Optical chirality sensing has gained significant attention in recent years. Within this field, the quest for stereodynamic chiroptical probes capable of detecting cryptochiral guests presents a formidable challenge. Macrocycles exhibiting planar chirality have emerged as promising candidates for amplifying the chirality of cryptochiral guests. In this study, we demonstrate that the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes between cryptochiral molecules and planar chiral prismarenes triggers electronic circular dichroism (ECD) signals via host&#8208;guest complexation&#8208;induced chirality amplification. The absolute configuration of the most stable chiral macrocyclic host&#8208;guest complex has been established by resorting to both exciton model and DFT computations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this supramolecular chirality sensing system can be employed to determine the enantiomeric composition of scalemic mixtures by measuring the ECD bands intensity. The information described here opens the way for the use of prismarenes as stereodynamic probes for sensing of cryptochiral guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Generation of Oxygenated Quaternary Centers via EnT Enabled Singlet O2 Addition to C3&#8208;Maleimidated Quinoxaline: A Reagent&#8208;Less Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demonstrated here is an external photo&#8208;sensitizer&#8208;free (auto&#8208;sensitized) singlet oxygen&#8208;enabled solvent&#8208;dependent tertiary hydroxylation and aryl&#8208;alkyl spiro&#8208;etherification of C3&#8208;maleimidated quinoxalines. Such &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; photo&#8208;oxygenation at Csp3&#8722;H and etherification involving Csp3&#8722;H/Csp2&#8722;H are unparalleled. Possibly, the highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8722;H tautomer allows the substrate to get excited by irradiation, and subsequently, it attains the triplet state via ISC. This excited triplet&#8208;state sensitized molecule then transfers its energy to a triplet&#8208;state oxygen (3O2) generating reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) for hydroxylation and spirocyclization depending on the solvent used. In HFIP, the generated alkoxy radical accepts a proton via HAT giving hydroxylated product. In contrast, in an aprotic PhCl it underwent a radical addition at the ortho&#8208;position of the C2 aryl to provide spiro&#8208;ether. An unprecedented orthogonal spiro&#8208;etherification was observed via the displacement of o&#8208;substitutents for ortho&#8208;substituted substrates. The order of ipso substitution follows the trend&#8211;OMe &gt; &#8211;OEt &gt; &#8211;F &gt; &#8211;H &gt; &#8211;Cl &gt; &#8211;Br. Both these oxygenation reactions can be carried out with nearly equal ease using direct sunlight without the requirement of any elaborate reaction setup. Demonstration of large&#8208;scale synthesis and a few interesting transformations have also been realized. Furthermore, several insightful control experiments and quantum chemical computations were performed to unravel the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Post&#8208;Synthesis Modification of Pyridyl&#8208;Substituted, Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Cationic Ligands for Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridyl&#8208;functionalized triazaphospholes provide the possibility for a post&#8208;synthesis modification, affording a variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic species. This is achieved by a chemoselective and stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms and can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the used electrophile. This targeted synthesis opens up a fascinating coordination chemistry.







Abstract
Triazaphospholes are potential polydentate ligands due to the presence of both phosphorus and nitrogen donor atoms within the aromatic 5&#8208;membered heterocycle. The incorporation of an additional pyridyl&#8208;substituent opens up the possibility of a post&#8208;synthesis modification via chemoselective and also stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms. This can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the electrophile and allows the targeted synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and dicationic ligands. Reaction with Cu(I)&#8208;halides causes the formation of cuprates of the type [CuXn](n&#8722;1)&#8722;, which enables coordination of the &#960;&#8208;acidic phosphorus donor to the negatively charged metal core, which is favored over the coordination by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating nitrogen atom. The use of cationic triazaphosphole derivatives can be used as a strategy to enforce the coordination of the ligand to an electron rich metal solely via the phosphorus atom. However, there is a subtle balance between the formation of either coordination polymers or dimeric structures, as the substitution pattern on the heterocycle and the nature of the halide have a large influence on the coordination motifs formed.

         <title>Advancements in Interfacial Engineering for Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial Engineering: As perovskite&#8208;based LEDs (PeLEDs) strive for higher efficiency, optimizing device performance solely through perovskite material enhancements becomes more challenging. Interfacial layers and device architecture are now recognized as crucial for stability and efficiency, playing vital roles in PeLED development. This perspective highlights advancements in PeLED devices, focusing on modifying adjacent layers interfacing with the perovskite film.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have gained significant attention due to their promising optoelectronic properties and potential applications in the fields of lighting and display devices. Despite their potential, PeLEDs face challenges related to stability, high turn&#8208;on voltage, and low external quantum efficiency (EQE) which has restricted their broad acceptance. Most research efforts have predominantly focused on refining the properties of the perovskite films. However, it is becoming more apparent that interfacial layers and device architecture are crucial for achieving stability and high efficiency, making them indispensable components in PeLED development. This perspective highlights remarkable advancements in PeLED devices, with a primary focus on modifying adjacent layers interfacing with the perovskite film.

         <title>Photoreduction of Trifluoromethyl Group: Lithium Ion Assisted Fluoride&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer from EDA Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8722;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET).







Abstract
Photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction is an efficient method for the mono&#8208;selective activation of the C&#8722;F bond on a trifluoromethyl group to construct a difluoroalkyl group. We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer (EDA&#8208;SET) of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8722;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Mechanistic studies revealed the generation of a &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl radical by single&#8208;electron reduction and defluorination, followed by the radical addition to alkenes. Lithium salt interacted with the fluorine atom to promote the photoinduced reduction mediated by the EDA complex. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET). FCET is a novel approach to C&#8722;F bond activation for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds.

         <title>Synthesis and Lewis Acid Properties of Neutral Silver(III) Adducts Containing the AgIII(CF3)3 Moiety</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic approaches to [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8722; (3&#8901;Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1), originally reported by Eujen and Naumann, are herein reinvestigated owing to major inconsistencies. Naumann's method provides 2 from 1 and HBF4, yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;), which is formed in&#8197;situ through nitrile cyclotrimerization enabled by AgIII/H+. In turn, chloride abstraction from 3&#8901;Cl using AgNO3 leads to [AgIII(CF3)3(ONO2)]&#8722; (5) instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, Sc&#8208;XRD and EA.

The acetonitrile AgIII complex [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) has been reported independently by Eujen and Naumann in the last century, albeit with intriguing NMR discrepancy. In their reports, 2 was claimed to be obtained starting from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8722; (3&#8901;Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1) via halide abstraction using AgNO3 or acidic treatment, resp. These two synthetic routes are herein reinvestigated. The feasibility of Naumann's method is demonstrated, thus providing 2 yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;). The formation of 2&#8217; is unprecedented and was thereby investigated. Both 2 and 2&#8217; were isolated in pure fashion and fully characterized. In turn, halide extraction from 3&#8901;Cl leads to the AgIII&#8208;ONO2 anion 5 instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, EA and Sc&#8208;XRD.

         <title>Polymorphism of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Coordination Polymers: Impact of a Lead&#8211;Sulfur Network on Photoconductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8722;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties resulting from inorganic (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n network structures. However, these structures have never been correlated with their electronic properties. We reveal the impact of the (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity by comparing S&#8722;CP crystal polymorphs.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8722;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties that originate from infinite M&#8722;S bond networks. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two polymorphs of a two&#8211;dimensional (2D) Pb(II) S&#8722;CP with a formula of [Pb(tzdt)(OAc)] (Htzdt=1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, OAc=acetate). Our findings revealed that the thermodynamic product (KGF&#8208;26) possesses quasi&#8208;2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with weak nonbonded Pb&#8722;S bonds, whereas the kinetic product (KGF&#8208;27) has intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with Pb&#8722;S bonds. The results of time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity measurements and first&#8211;principles calculations confirmed that KGF&#8208;27 exhibits higher photoconductivity than KGF&#8208;26, which establishes that the inorganic (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks with Pb&#8722;S bonds are crucial for achieving high photoconductivity. This is the first experimental demonstration of the impact of the (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity through the comparison of crystal polymorphisms.

         <title>Theoretical Study of the Ternary Compound Monolayer CuP2Se for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Efficient Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The left panels mean the most stable adsorption configurations for each step of the hydrogen reduction and oxygen evolution half&#8208;reactions, while the right panels are the corresponding Gibbs free energy changes. The variation of energy change of uphill and downhill in the right panels indicate the endothermic and exothermic reactions, respectively.







Abstract
Utilizing photocatalytic method to produce hydrogen by splitting water is an efficient strategy to solve the hotspot issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution. Herein, we systematically investigate the corresponding properties of the reported Cu&#8208;bearing ternary compound monolayer CuP2Se by using the first&#8208;principle calculations. The monolayer CuP2Se has quite small cleavage energy of 0.51&#8197;J/m2, indicating it can be easily produced by the mechanical exfoliation method experimentally. In addition, it is an indirect bandgap semiconductor material which has a moderate value of 1.91&#8197;eV. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) can perfectly straddle the redox potentials of water when a biaxial strain of &#8722;4% to 4% is applied, unveiling the high photocatalytic thermodynamic stability of monolayer CuP2Se in response to the effect of solvent tension. Remarkably, the monolayer CuP2Se also demonstrates significant sunlight capturing ability in the visible region. The outstanding electronic and optical properties suggest that the monolayer CuP2Se is undoubtedly a viable material for photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Defect Induced Structural Transition and Lipase Immobilization in Mesoporous Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The synthesis of AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H, and AlPDA&#8208;68 with insights into Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Al&#8208;MOFs), their defect structures, lattice rearrangement, and the role of defects and disorders in the transformation from AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF to AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H.







Abstract
The transition from disorder to order and structural transformation are distinctive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) features. How to adapt or control both behaviors in MOF has rarely been studied. In this case, we demonstrate that our successful synthesis of [Al(OH)(PDA)]n (AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H, and AlPDA&#8208;68) with H2PDA=4,4&#8242;&#8208;[1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(ethyne&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl)]&#8208;di benzoic acid has shown the intricate world of Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Al&#8208;MOFs). It offers profound insights into defect structures to order and transformations. AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, in particular, revealed a fascinating interplay of various pore sizes within both micro and mesoporous regions, unveiling a unique lattice rearrangement phenomenon upon solvent desorption. Defects and disorders emerged as crucial impacts of transforming AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, with its initially imperfect crystallinity, into the highly crystalline, hierarchically porous AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state glass nanopipettes, also known as nanopores or nanochannels, are an attractive class of sensing platforms due to their inherent advantages, such as confined space, mechanical stability, and scalable functionalization. By monitoring dynamic switches of surface charge or resistive pulse, various applications have been developed, like biosensors, DNA sequencing, and drug delivery.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state glass nanopipettes provide a promising confined space that offers several advantages such as controllable size, simple preparation, low cost, good mechanical stability, and good thermal stability. These advantages make them an ideal choice for various applications such as biosensors, DNA sequencing, and drug delivery. In this review, we first delve into the functionalized nanopipettes for sensing various analytes and the methods used to develop detection means with them. Next, we provide an in&#8208;depth overview of the advanced functionalization methodologies of nanopipettes based on diversified chemical kinetics. After that, we present the latest state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements and potential applications in detecting a wide range of targets, including ions, molecules, biological macromolecules, and single cells. We examine the various challenges that arise when working with these targets, as well as the innovative solutions developed to overcome them. The final section offers an in&#8208;depth overview of the current development status, newest trends, and application prospects of sensors. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art functionalized nanopipette perception sensing and development of detection means and offers valuable insights into the prospects for this exciting field.

         <title>Coordination of a Phosphine&#8208;Tethered Aminoborane to Group 10 Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and coordination chemistry of a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand to group 10 metals is reported, affording a rare aminoborane &#960;&#8208;complex of Ni(0). The bonding situation is best described as a 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron bond where the Ni and N atoms compete for an accepting orbital on boron. In contrast with isoelectronic olefin &#960;&#8208;complexes, the metal&#8208;ligand bond is tenuous and the B=N ligand is therefore easily displaced.







Abstract
While &#960;&#8208;complexes of C=C bonds are ubiquitous in organometallic chemistry, analogous complexes of the isoelectronic but strongly polarized B=N double bond of aminoboranes are extremely scarce. To address this gap, a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand (PhDPBAiPr) is introduced and its coordination with group 10 metals is investigated. The B=N bond does not coordinate to the metal in Pt(0) and Pd(II) complexes. In contrast, side&#8208;on coordination of the B=N bond is observed in the Ni(0) complex (PhDPBAiPr)Ni(NCPh), and the X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals B&#8722;N bond elongation compared to the free ligand. The choice of co&#8208;ligand strongly influences the presence or absence of side&#8208;on coordination at Ni(0) as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. While the B=N &#960;&#8208;complex is geometrically similar to C=C analogues, a bonding analysis reveals that the interaction of the B=N motif with the electron&#8208;rich Ni(0) center is best described as 3c4e hyperbond, in which Ni and N are competing for the empty orbital on B.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;Glycans Terminating in Sialyl&#8208;Lewisx Reveals the Importance of Glycan Complexity for Influenza A Virus Receptor Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of twenty&#8208;two isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm prepared by a chemoenzymatic strategy reveals that glycan complexity can modulate receptor specificities of hemagglutinins of H5 influenza A viruses.







Abstract
Sialyl&#8208;Lewisx (SLex) is involved in immune regulation, human fertilization, cancer, and bacterial and viral diseases. The influence of the complex glycan structures, which can present SLex epitopes, on binding is largely unknown. We report here a chemoenzymatic strategy for the preparation of a panel of twenty&#8208;two isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm that include putative high&#8208;affinity ligands for E&#8208;selectin. The N&#8208;glycans were prepared starting from a sialoglycopeptide isolated from egg yolk powder and took advantage of inherent substrate preferences of glycosyltransferases and the use of 5&#8242;&#8208;diphospho&#8208;N&#8208;trifluoracetylglucosamine (UDP&#8208;GlcNHTFA) that can be transferred by branching N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferases to give, after base treatment, GlcNH2&#8208;containing glycans that temporarily disable an antenna from enzymatic modification. Glycan microarray binding studies showed that E&#8208;selectin bound equally well to linear glycans and tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex. On the other hand, it was found that hemagglutinins (HA) of H5 influenza A viruses (IAV) preferentially bound the tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans. Furthermore, several H5 HAs preferentially bound to N&#8208;glycan presenting SLex on the MGAT4 arm. SLex is displayed in the respiratory tract of several avian species, demonstrating the relevance of investigating the binding of, among others IAVs, to complex N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex.

         <title>Improving the Stability and Kinetic Inertness of Mn(II) Complexes by Increasing the Bridge Length in Bicyclic CDTA&#8208;Like Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic trans&#8208;diaminotetraacetate ligands were synthesized to form paramagnetic Mn(II) complexes with improved kinetic inertness for application as MRI contrast agents. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH&#8208;DTA), ethylene (BCO&#8208;DTA) to propylene (BCN&#8208;DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different structures on the relaxometric properties, thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes.







Abstract
Kinetic inertness of Mn(II)&#8208;based MRI contrast agents can be improved by increasing the rigidity of the polydentate ligand that tightly coordinate the metal ion. Taking inspiration from the remarkable increase in kinetic inertness of [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722; compared to [Mn(EDTA)]2&#8722; due to the cyclohexyl backbone rigidity, we devised that bicyclic ligands would further improve the kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH&#8208;DTA), ethylene (BCO&#8208;DTA) to propylene (BCN&#8208;DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different trans&#8208;diaminotetraacetate ligands on relaxometric, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the Mn(II) complexes. 1H and 17O&#8197;NMR relaxometric studies showed a slight increase in relaxivity and a faster water exchange rate in these Mn(II)&#8208;complexes with respect to [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722;. Solution studies revealed that the conditional stability (pMn) and dissociation half&#8208;life (t1/2) at pH&#8197;7.4 follow the order [Mn(BCH&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722;&lt;[Mn(BCO&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722;&lt;[Mn(BCN&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722; highlighting the effect of the bridge length on the overall stability of the Mn(II) complexes. Remarkably, [Mn(BCN&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722; shows an improved pMn value and a 7&#8208;times higher kinetic inertness than [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722;. NMR studies on the Zn(II) analogues confirm the rigidity of the bicyclic complexes with an isomerization process at &gt;313&#8197;K for the smaller bridged complex [Zn(BCH&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722;.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes with benzoxazole derivatives and non&#8208;innocent ligands as effective antioxidants in human neuroblasts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes continue to raise increasing interest for the encouraging results in several biomedical areas. Considering their vast chemical&#8208;physical repertoire, in particular the possibility to switch from the sensitization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to ROS&#8208;scavenging abilities by tuning the nature of their ligands, it is therefore surprising that their potential as antioxidants has not been largely investigated so far. Herein, we explored the antioxidant behaviour of the novel ruthenium compound [Ru(dbpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru1), featuring a benzoxazole derivative (dpby = 2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;ossazolyl)pyridine) and the non&#8208;innocent 2,3&#8208;diamminonaftalene (2,3 DAN) ligand, along with the reference tpy&#8208;containing analogue [Ru(tpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru2) (tpy = 2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine). Following the synthesis and the electrochemical characterization, chemical antioxidant assays highlighted the beneficial role of dpby for the ROS&#8208;scavenging properties of Ru1. These data have been corroborated by the highest protective effect of Ru1 against the oxidative stress induced in SH&#8208;SY5Y human neuroblastoma, which exerts pro&#8208;survival and anti&#8208;inflammatory actions. The results herein reported highlight the potential of Ru1 as pharmacological tool in neurodegenerative diseases and specially prove that the antioxidant properties of such compounds are likely the result of a non&#8208;trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Sensors for Benzene Vapor</title>

The development and challenges of benzene vapor sensors based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which achieve effective detection by virtue of the singal changes in weight, chemiresistive, fluorescence or color after adsorption.







Abstract
Sensing of benzene vapor is a hot spot due to the volatile drastic carcinogen even at trace concentration. However, achieving convenient and rapid detection is still a challenge. As a sort of functional porous material, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed as detection sensors by adsorbing benzene vapor and converting it into other signals (fluorescence intensity/wavelength, chemiresistive, weight or color, etc.). Supramolecular interaction between benzene molecules and the host framework, aperture size/shape and structural flexibility are influential factors in the performance of MOF&#8208;based sensors. Therefore, enhancing the host&#8208;guest interactions between the host framework and benzene molecules, or regulating the diffusion rate of benzene molecules by changing the aperture size/shape and flexibility of the host framework to enhance the detection signal are effective strategies for constructing MOF&#8208;based sensors. This concept highlights several types of MOF&#8208;based sensors for the detection of benzene vapor.

         <title>Highly Stable Self&#8208;Regenerating Organic Multi&#8208;Redox Systems derived from Bicyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (BICAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable organic radical cations with multiple redox states spanning over notably wide redox range (1.8&#8197;V) were derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The availability of stable multiple redox states was utilized in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. The system works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process with a minimum capacity loss and regenerated upon exposure to air.







Abstract
An extended class of organic multi&#8208;redox systems was derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The highly&#8208;conjugated system undergoes a total of 4 redox events spanning a 1.8&#8197;V redox range. These organic compounds exhibited four different stable redox states (dication, radical cation, neutral and radical anion), and all of them were characterized either by single crystal X&#8208;ray study and/or various spectroscopic studies. Three of the four redox states are stable to air and moisture. The availability of stable multiple redox states demonstrated promise towards their efficacy in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. Among various redox states, the dication/neutral state works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process outside glovebox in commercially available DMF with minimum capacity loss (retaining nearly 90&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency). Surprisingly, the efficiency of the redox cycle was retained even if the system was exposed to air for 30&#8197;days when it slowly regenerated to the initial deep blue radical cation, and it exhibited another 100 charge/discharge cycles with a minimal capacity loss. Such a stable H&#8208;cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule&#8208;based systems.

Such a stable H-cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A simple, effective, direct, and environmentally benign but unprecedented high mutual separation efficiency for Nd and Pr from their oxide mixture with &#946;Nd/Pr&gt;500 by selective dissolution in water equilibrated C4mim.NTf2 ionic liquid containing TTA.







Abstract
A simple, efficient, direct and economical method for the mutual separation of Nd and Pr was developed by the selective dissolution of Nd2O3 from their oxide mixtures in an ionic liquid containing 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) resulting in an unprecedented separation factor (&#946;Nd/Pr)&gt;500, which is 277&#8197;times more than the thus far reported &#946;Nd/Pr values. The proposed mechanism was supported by DFT computations.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Nano&#8208;Reservoir for Room Temperature RNA Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been studied for room&#8208;temperature storage of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs). The RNAs loaded in COFs maintained their structural integrity when stored in ambient conditions for weeks and were found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation in the presence of RNase.







Abstract
The emerging role of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as therapeutics is alluring. However, RNAs are extremely labile under ambient conditions and typically need to be stored in cryogenic conditions (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Hence, storage, stabilization, and transportation of RNA under ambient conditions have been an arduous task and remain an unsolved problem. In this work, a guanidinium&#8208;based ionic covalent organic framework (COF), TTGCl with nanotubular morphology, was synthesized and used as nano&#8208;reservoirs for room&#8208;temperature storage of RNA. To understand the role of the nanotubular morphology and chemical nature of TTGCl in stabilizing the RNA structure and for comparison purposes, a neutral COF, TMT&#8208;TT, is synthesized and studied. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed non&#8208;covalent interaction between the COFs and the RNA nucleobases, facilitating reversible storage of RNA. RNA loaded in COFs was found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation when treated with RNase. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the structural integrity of the recovered RNAs and their further processibility.

         <title>A Case&#8208;Study on the Photophysics of Chalcogen&#8208;Substituted Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully systematic analysis of the effect of chalcogen atoms on the photophysical properties (absorption and fluorescence spectra, excited state lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration) of 30 custom&#8208;made chalcogen&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described. Intersystem crossing rate constants were estimated by several independent methods and showed a dependency scaling as Z0.4 and &#950;0.2.







Abstract
Singlet dioxygen has been widely applied in different disciplines such as medicine (photodynamic therapy or blood sterilization), remediation (wastewater treatment) or industrial processes (fine chemicals synthesis). Particularly, it can be conveniently generated by energy transfer between a photosensitizer's triplet state and triplet dioxygen upon irradiation with visible light. Among the best photosensitizers, substituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines are prominent due to their excellent photophysical properties, which can be tuned by structural modifications, such as halogen&#8208; and chalcogen&#8208;atom substitution. These patterns allow for the enhancement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, commonly attributed to the heavy atom effect, which correlates with the atomic number (
) and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (
) of the introduced heteroatom. Herein, a fully systematic analysis of the effect exerted by chalcogen atoms on the photophysical characteristics (absorption and fluorescence properties, lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration), involving 30 custom&#8208;made &#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted chalcogen&#8208;bearing zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described and evaluated regarding the heavy atom effect. Besides, the intersystem crossing rate constants are estimated by several independent methods and a quantitative profile of the heavy atom is provided by using linear correlations between relative intersystem crossing rates and relative atomic numbers. Good linear trends for both intersystem crossing rates (S1&#8208;T1 and T1&#8208;S0) were obtained, with a dependency on the atomic number and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant scaling as 
 and 
, respectively The trend shows to be independent of the solvent and temperature.

         <title>Bending a Cumulene with Electrons: Stepwise Chemical Reduction and Structural Study of a Tetraaryl[4]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bend or not to bend? The chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene using cesium gives the mono&#8208; and doubly&#8208;reduced cumulenes. Crystallographic analysis reveals dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene with cesium metal was explored, and the structural changes stemming from electron acquisition are detailed using X&#8208;ray crystallography. It is found that the [4]cumulene undergoes dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar. The structural deformation is consistent with early theoretical reports that suggest that the twisting should occur upon reduction of both even and odd [n]cumulenes. The current results, on the other hand, are inconsistent with a previous experimental study of a [3]cumulene in which the predicted twisting is not observed upon reduction. DFT calculations reveal that the barrier to deformation is an order of magnitude lower in a [3]cumulene than a [4]cumulene, allowing the barrier to be overcome in the solid&#8208;state.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report our recent discovery of mechanochemical C&#8722;H arylation and alkylation reaction of indoles using 3&#8201;d transition metal (iron and cobalt) via online preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents. This method addresses the limitations of the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization, and provides an efficient, concise, and sustainable approach for this field.

Although the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the persistent problems, including the use of sensitive Grignard reagents and the rigorous operations (solvent&#8208;drying, inert gas protection, metal pre&#8208;activation and RMgX addition rate control), still leave great room for further development of sustainable methodologies. Herein, we report a mechanochemical technology toward in&#8208;situ preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents, and thus building two general 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic platforms that enables regioselective arylation and alkylation of indoles with a wide variety of halides (including those containing post transformable functionalities and heteroaromatic rings). This mechanochemical strategy also brings unique reactivity and high step&#8208;economy in producing functionalized N&#8208;free indole products.

         <title>The Role of Base in Reaction Performance of Photochemical Synthesis of Thiazoles: An Integrated Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the prediction of the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole. Different AI/ML methods are then employed for model training and testing. Feature analysis is conducted through the model interpretation process, enabling further exploration into the reaction mechanisms. We then chose two substrates of distinct structures and verified the predictions through experimental benchwork. This represents a novel reaction with different bases.







Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) is emerging as pivotal in synthetic chemistry, offering revolutionary potential in retrosynthetic analysis, reaction conditions and reaction prediction. We have combined chemical descriptors, primarily based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, with various AI/ML tools such as Multi&#8208;Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole in photoredox reactions. Significantly, our models underscore the critical role of the molecular structure and physicochemical characteristics of the base, especially the total atomic polarizabilities, in the rate&#8208;determining steps involving cyclohexyl and phenethyl moieties of the substrate. Moreover, we validated our findings in articles through experimental studies. It showcases the power of AI/ML and quantum chemistry in shaping the future of organic chemistry.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Solvatochirochromism of Single Benzene Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents is reported. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.







Abstract
Solvents influence the structure, aggregation and folding behaviors of solvatochromic compounds. Ultrasensitive solvent mediated chiroptical response is conducive to the fabrication of molecular platform for sensing and recognition, which however, remains great challenges in conceptual or applicable design. Here we report a cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents. Compared to the ratiometrically responsive systems, the chiroptical activities could be triggered or inverted depending on the substituents of chiral entities with an ultralow solvent volume fraction (&lt;1&#8197;vol&#8201;%). One drop of dipolar solvents shall significantly induce the emergence or inversion of chiroptical signals in bulky phases. Based on the experimental and computational studies, the ultrasensitivity is contributed to the intimate interplay between solvents and chiral compounds that anchors the specific chiral conformation. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.

         <title>Pertechnetates &#8211; A Structural Study Across the Periodic Table</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of pertechnetate salts has been extended for a majority of the elements of the periodic table. A systematic crystallographic study of their coordination and level of hydration gives insight into periodic trends. The picture shows the M&#8722;Otc bond lengths of all known pertechnetates.







Abstract
The number of crystal structures of pertechnetates derived from aqueous solutions has been expanded from seven to over 30. We report the conversion of NH4TcO4 to aqueous HtcO4 via acidic cation exchange. This is followed by the synthesis and structural elucidation of pertechnetate salts of alkaline earth (AE), transition metal I and lanthanoids (Ln) elements. Various degrees of hydration and coordination are discussed. Where possible, a comparison with the perrhenate homologues is made. The described syntheses and materials may be used as novel starting materials for extended technetium research.

         <title>Influence of Polymer Side Chain Size and Backbone Length on the Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Polymer Bottlebrushes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) can assemble into supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes in water when conjugated to hydrophilic polymers. Here we investigate the effect of side and main chain lengths of the attached polymers on the resulting morphologies. Both longer main and side chains induce a morphological transition from cylindrical to spherical micelles, but the latter can even prevent any form of aggregation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush&#8208;like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of perfect polar dipole alignment in ferroelectric lattices of organic non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) materials demonstrates the potential for crystal engineering by rational design to craft materials with advanced optical performance. The methoxyphenyl series of acetophenone azines feature polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). These third&#8208;generation chromophores feature superior triple T&#8208;contacts and improved crystal growth, and they excel because of their enhanced NLO properties.







Abstract
An improved design is described for ferroelectric crystals and implemented with the &#8220;methoxyphenyl series&#8221; of acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines with Y=F (1), Cl (2), Br (3), or I (4). The crystal structures of these azines exhibit polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). Azines 1, 3, and 4 form true racemates whereas chloroazine 2 crystallizes as a kryptoracemate. Azines 1&#8211;4 are helical because of the N&#8722;N bond conformation. In true racemates the molecules of opposite helicity (M and P) are enantiomers A(M) and A*(P) while in kryptoracemates they are diastereomers A(M) and B*(P). The stacking mode of PBAMs is influenced by halogen bonding, with 2&#8211;4 showcasing a kink due to directional interlayer halogen bonding, whereas fluoroazine 1 demonstrates ideal polar stacking by avoiding it. Notably, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines display a stronger bias for dipole parallel alignment, attributed to the linearity of the biphenyl moiety as compared to the phenoxy series of (PhO, Y)&#8208;azines with their non&#8208;linear Ph&#8722;O&#8722;Ph moiety. The crystals of 1&#8211;4 all feature planar biphenyls and this synthon facilitates their crystallization through potent triple T&#8208;contacts and enhances their nonlinear optical (NLO) performance by increasing conjugation length and affecting favorable chromophore conformations in the solids.

         <title>A Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction for the Synthesis of Diindolylmethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation &#8211; organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes is presented. The synthesis of 21&#8197;derivatives with overall yields of up to 85&#8201;% showed that we were able to expand the range of readily accessible diidolylmethanes while demonstrating the utility of our presented method.







Abstract
Herein, we present an efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes. Classic syntheses have relied on (Lewis) acid activation of aldehydes, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive in handling. In contrast, the combination of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and subsequent organocatalytic activation of the in&#8208;situ formed aldehydes allows the use of readily available and stable alkenes with various functional groups while avoiding acidic conditions to expand the range of available diindolylmethanes. A broad scope of diindolylmethanes was prepared in yields up to 85&#8201;% demonstrates the utility of the presented method.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Access to N,O&#8208;Acetals from Enamides by Means of Electron&#8208;Poor Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamides can be converted into their N,O&#8208;acetals using just electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimides together with light, without the need for thiophenol as additive or strong acids as catalyst.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;acetals are found as structural motifs in natural products and are important synthetic precursors for N&#8208;acylimines as building blocks in organic synthesis for C&#8722;C&#8208;bond formation and amines. For the synthesis of N,O&#8208;acetals, an acid&#8208;, base&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic method is reported applying N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide and N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;2,5,8,11&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide as extremely electron&#8208;deficient photocatalysts. The first perylene bisimide highly selectively photocatalyzes the formation of the N,O&#8208;acetals as products in high yields, and the second and more electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide allows these reactions without thiophenol as an H&#8208;atom transfer reagent. Calculated electron density maps support this. The reaction scope comprises different substituents at the nitrogen of the enamides and different alcohols as starting material. Dehydroalanines are converted to non&#8208;natural amino acids which shows the usefulness of this method for organic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Flip via Subtle Electronic Perturbation in Axially Ligated Diiron(III) Porphyrin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slight electronic perturbation at the axial ligand of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip from high to intermediate via an admixed state. This is at par with the metalloenzymes, which employ minute perturbations around the periphery of the active sites, leading to spin state transitions.







Abstract
Spin state switching in the metal center is a crucial phenomenon in many enzymatic reactions in biology. The spin state alteration, a critical step in cytochrome P450 catalysis, is driven most likely through a weak perturbation upon substrate binding in the enzyme, which is still not well clarified. In the current work, the spin state transition of iron(III) from high to intermediate via an admixed state is observed upon a subtle electronic perturbation to the sulphonate moieties coordinated axially to a diiron(III)porphyrin dimer. While electron&#8208;donating substituents stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of iron(III), strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing groups stabilize an intermediate&#8208;spin state, whereas the moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of axial ligands resulted in an admixed state. Confirmation of the molecular structures and their spin states have been made utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, M&#246;ssbauer, magnetic, EPR, and 1H NMR spectroscopic investigations. The position of the signals of the porphyrin macrocycle in the paramagnetic 1H NMR is found to be very characteristic of the spin state of the iron center in solution. The Curie plot for the pure high&#8208;spin complexes shows the signals&#8242; temperature dependency in line with the Curie law. Conversely, the pure intermediate&#8208;spin state of iron exhibits an anti&#8208;Curie temperature dependence, whereas the admixed&#8208;spin state of iron displays significant curvature of the lines in the Curie plot. An extensive DFT analysis displays a linear dependence between the energy difference between d
 and d
 orbital versus Fe&#8722;Npor distance for the complexes reported here. Furthermore, a strong linear correlation between the Fe&#8722;O distance and the spin density over the oxygen atom, as well as the Fe&#8722;Npor distance for the complexes, has been observed. Thus, a slight electronic perturbation at the axial ligand of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip. This is at par with the metalloenzymes, which employ minute perturbations around the periphery of the active sites, leading to spin state transitions.

         <dc:description>
A environmentally benign and efficient method for the synthesis of pyridazino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles has been developed via a novel [3+3] annulation reaction of 2&#8208;alkenylindoles and hydrazonyl chlorides. This reaction proceeded smoothly in the presence of base with excellent yield and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A novel [3+3] annulation reaction of 2&#8208;alkenylindoles with hydrazonyl chlorides in the presence of base for the formation of pyridazino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles was developed. This approach provided a convenient and efficient way to synthesize a series of functionalized pyridazino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles derivatives. The method exhibited a broad substrate scope and provided the corresponding pyridazino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles products with excellent yields.

         <title>Nanoreactor Confined and Enriched Intermediates for Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>

Copper sulfide nanoreactor (donated as CuS&#8722;NR) catalyst was fabricated for eCO2RR to C2+ products and the corresponding FE reaches 53&#8201;%, which is the highest value reported for copper sulfide&#8208;based catalysts. The excellent C&#8722;C coupling performance comes from the confinement and enrichment of intermediate in the nanoreactor.







Abstract
In the process of electroreduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, it is imperative to enhance the concentration of key intermediate species on the catalyst surface. The utilization of micro&#8208;nano reactors to achieve confinement effects has been widely observed in various catalytic reactions, yet it has seldom been employed in eCO2RR. Here, we present a novel nanoreactor composed of stacked CuS nanosheets for eCO2RR to C2+ products. In comparison to catalyst comprising of nanosheet with open space, the C&#8722;C coupling within this confined nanospace is significantly enhanced, resulting in the increase of Faraday efficiency (FE) of C2+ products to 53&#8201;%. In situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy reveals the confinement and enrichment of key intermediate by the nanoreactor. Our research findings demonstrate that a meticulously designed nanoreactor can elevate the selectivity of C2+ products, thereby aiding in the design of eCO2RR catalysts.

The combination of magnetometry and multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal large positive axial zero&#8208;field splitings, D&#8217;s, for 8 and 9 (24&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 32&#8197;cm&#8722;1), and in&#8208;depth ligand field analyses on top of wave function based ab initio calculations demonstrated that the Co(II) out&#8208;of&#8208;equatorial plane distance, &#948;, determines the sign and magnitude of D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal high spin Co(II) complexes.







Abstract
Here, we combined magnetometry, multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance, and wave function based ab initio calculations to investigate magnetic properties of two high spin Co(II) complexes Co(BDPRP) (BDPRP=2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;R)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidi&#8208;nyl)methyl)pyridine, R=H for 8; R=tBu for 9). Complexes&#8197;8 and 9 featuring effective D3h symmetry were found to possess D=24.0 and 32.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively, in their S=3/2 ground states of 
. Ligand field analyses revealed that the low&#8208;lying d&#8208;d excited states make either positive or vanishing contributions to D. Hence, total positive D values were measured for 8 and 9, as well as related D3h high spin Co(II) complexes. In contrast, negative D values are usually observed for C3v congeners. In&#8208;depth analyses suggested that lowering symmetry from D3h to C3v induces orbital mixing between 
 and 
 and admixes excited state 
 into the ground state. Both factors turn the total D value progressively negative with the increasing distance (&#948;) of the Co(II) center out of the equatorial plane. Therefore, &#948; determines the sign and magnitude of final D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal S=3/2 Co(II) complexes as measured for a series of such species with varying &#948;.

         <title>Designing Ionic Ir(III) Cyclometalated Complexes as Photocatalysts for Light Assisted ATRP of MMA. A Combined Experimental and Mechanistic Study</title>

A new family of ionic Ir(III)&#8208;complexes was designed, prepared and assessed for the visible light assisted ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA). A complete experimental and mechanistic study is performed to shed light on the key factors for the proper control of the polymerization process.







Abstract
A new family of ionic Ir(III) cyclometalated complexes with general formula [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br], was designed and prepared to be assessed as photocalysts for the visible light assisted ATRP polymerization of MMA. To this purpose, our design strategy involved both: i) the decoration of the cyclometalating (CN) and the ancillary (NN) ligands with various electron withdrawing and/or electron donor substituents and, ii) the use of Br&#8722; as the counter anion for these cationic Ir(III) species. After an extensive screening in which the [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br]&#8208;type compounds were compared to the model neutral complex fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3], the &#8220;fully&#8221; amino&#8208;substituted ion pairs abbreviated as [10][Br] and [11][Br], exhibited the best photocatalytic performances under irradiation with CFL lamps. It is worth noting that the outcomes of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments combined with theoretical DFT calculations, enlightened the role played by the Ir(III) complexes in the mechanism of the photoATRP process, and suggested the rationalization of the different performances that were highlighted by our Ir(III) catalyst in the visible light assisted photopolymerization of MMA.

         <title>From Stilbenes to carbo&#8208;Stilbenes: an Encouraging Prospect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel bis&#8208;carbo&#8208;benzenic molecules, derived from the stilbene parent, are explored beyond carbo&#8208;naphthalene and carbo&#8208;biphenyl. The synthesis, structure, and properties of these carbo&#8208;stilbenes are investigated using experimental and computational methods. The molecules exhibit isomerization, with cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers, and the calculated cis&#8208;isomer shows a helical structure. The UV&#8208;vis spectra display broad bands, and voltammograms indicate classical behavior for carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives.







Abstract
Beyond previously described carbo&#8208;naphthalene and carbo&#8208;biphenyl, a novel type of bis&#8208;carbo&#8208;benzenic molecules is envisaged from the stilbene parent. The synthesis, structure, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of two such carbo&#8208;stilbenes are described at complementary experimental and computational DFT levels. In the selected targets, the bare skeletal carbo&#8208;mer of carbo&#8208;stilbene is decorated by 8 or 10 phenyl groups, 0 or 2 tert&#8208;butyl groups, and 2 n&#8208;octyl chains, the later substituents being introduced to compensate anticipated solubility issues. As in the parent stilbene series, isomers of the phenylated carbo&#8208;stilbenes are characterized. The cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers are, however, formed in almost equal amounts and could not be separated by either chromatography or crystallization. Nevertheless, due to a slow interconversion at the NMR time scale (up to 55&#8201;&#176;C) the 1H NMR signals of both isomers of the two carbo&#8208;stilbenes could be tentatively assigned. The calculated structure of the cis&#8208;isomer exhibits a helical shape, consistent with the observed magnetic shielding of phenyl p&#8208;CH nuclei residing inside the shielding cone of the facing C18 ring. The presence of the two isomers in solution also gives rise to quite broad UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra with main bands at ca 460, 560 and 710&#8197;nm, and a significant bathochromic shift for the decaphenylated carbo&#8208;stilbene vs the di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;octaphenylated counterpart. Square wave voltammograms do not show any resolution of the two isomers, giving a reversible reduction wave at &#8722;0.65 or &#8722;0.58&#8197;V/SCE, and an irreversible oxidation peak at 1.11&#8197;V/SCE, those values being classical for most carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives. Calculated NICS values (NICS(1)=&#8722;12.5&#177;0.2&#8197;ppm) also indicate that the aromatic nature of the C18 rings is not markedly affected by the dialkynylbutatriene (DAB) connector between them.

We report a general, regioselective, and metal free &#947;&#8208;fluorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls via silyl dienol ethers that are readily prepared from simple ketones and aldehydes. The transformation displays broad scope including 27 cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes providing &#947;&#8208;fluoro compounds in 28&#8211;91&#8201;% yield. Notably, the reported conditions are also suitable for the synthesis of challenging tertiary fluorides. The regioselectivity of the reaction was studied on a series of acyclic siloxydienes and was observed to be sensitive to the conformational flexibility of the substrate. Diversification of the &#947;&#8208;fluorocarbonyls demonstrates the promise of fluorine as a stereocontrol element.

         <title>N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Sulfurdiimides are Strongly Redox Tuned</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 4&#8208; and 2,4,6&#8208;substituted diaryl sulfur diimides induce a large dependence on redox properties, such as the one&#8208;electron reduction CV waves shown here, that correlate linearly with the redox MO energies. One&#8208;electron transfers are confirmed using in&#8197;situ EPR spectroscopy, identifying radical anions that have longer lifetimes the more electron withdrawing the substituents.







Abstract
The synthesis and extensive characterization of nine aryl sulfur diimides (SDIs, Ar&#8722;NSN&#8722;Ar) are presented with a robust computational and experimental investigation of the fundamental properties of these important members of the thiazyl family of compounds, with particular attention paid to their highly tunable electrochemical behaviour. This is the first work to undertake a systematic comparison of the electrochemical profiles of a coherent series of SDIs to demonstrate and quantify the response of their reduction potentials to substituent electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing properties. This effect is found to be not only exceptionally strong, but also correlates very closely with computed orbital energies. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to determine the nature, localization, and qualitative lifetimes of the radical anions of SDIs. This work also addresses significant misconceptions about physical properties of SDIs. Experimental data and modern computational methods are employed to provide a resolute answer to the long&#8208;standing contention of the solution&#8208;state conformations of SDIs, and to correct historical mistakes in the assignment of infrared spectroscopic data. High&#8208;quality crystal structures of all SDIs in this work showcase the utility of the recently introduced structural refinement software NoSpherA2, enabling full anisotropic refinement of H&#8208;atoms with accurate C&#8722;H bond lengths.

         <title>Cavity Catalysis of an Enantioselective Reaction under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavity catalysis: Vibro&#8208;polaritonic states influence an enantioselective reaction under strong coupling. An increase in the conversion yield is obtained by coupling the carbonyl band of the reactant to an infrared cavity without affecting the enantiomeric excess. These experiments underline the use of polaritonic chemistry for selective control of chemical reactions by coupling to vacuum fluctuations.







Abstract
Strong light&#8208;matter interaction is emerging as an exciting tool for controlling chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate an L&#8208;proline&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric Aldol reaction under vibrational strong coupling. Both the reactants (4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone) carbonyl bands are coupled to an infrared photon and react in the presence of L&#8208;proline. The reaction mixture is eluted from the cavity, and the conversion yields and enantiomeric excess are quantified using NMR and chiral HPLC. The conversion yields increase by up to 90&#8201;% in ON&#8208;resonance conditions. Interestingly, a large increase in the conversion yield does not affect the enantiomeric excess. Further control experiments were carried out by varying the temperature, and we propose that the rate&#8208;limiting step may not be the deciding factor in enantioselectivity. Whereas the formation of the enamine intermediate is modified by cavity coupling experiments. For this class of enantioselective reactions, strong coupling does not change the enantiomeric excess, possibly due to the large energy difference in chiral transition states. Strong coupling can boost the formation of enamine intermediate, thereby favouring the product yield. This gives more hope to test polaritonic chemistry based on enantioselective reactions in which the branching ratios can be controlled.

         <title>Ligand Centered Reactivity of a Transition Metal Bound Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN). Despite no longer exhibiting a constrained geometry when coordinated to metal centres, the P(NNN) phosphine retains its ability to activate polar E&#8722;H bonds (including those of amines and ammonia).







Abstract
The electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar (C2v symmetric) acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN), are described. On complexation to metal centers, the phosphine was found to adopt a distorted trigonal pyramidal structure with a high barrier to pyramidal inversion (22.3&#8197;kcal/mol at 298&#8197;K for Au[P(NNN)]Cl). Spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations carried out at the density functional level of theory indicate that P(NNN) is a moderate &#963;&#8208;donor, with significant &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. Despite the distortion undergone by the phosphorus atom on coordination to metal centers, the P(NNN) ligand retains its ability to react with small molecule substrates with polar E&#8722;H bonds (MeOH, NH2Ph, NH3). It does so in a concerted fashion across one of the P&#8722;N bonds, and reversibly in the case of amine substrates. This cooperative bond activation chemistry may ultimately prove beneficial in catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;We report on the electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar acridane-derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN). Despite no longer exhibiting a constrained geometry when coordinated to metal centres, the P(NNN) phosphine retains its ability to activate polar E&#8722;H bonds (including those of amines and ammonia).

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Multicatalytic Cerium Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Cleavage of O&#8722;H Bearing Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>

An approach toward general &#946; C&#8722;C bond scission reactions of carboxylic acids and hemiacetals is presented. The present work demonstrates the power of a multicatalytic cerium&#8208;based photoredox platform to enable direct hydrodecarboxylation of carboxylic acids as well as redox&#8208;neutral ring cleavage of lactol derivatives.







Abstract
The need for synthetic methodologies capable of rapidly altering molecular structure are in high demand. Most existing methods to modify scaffolds rely on net exothermicity to drive the desired transformation. We sought to develop a general strategy for the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds &#946; to hydroxyl groups independent of inherent substrate strain. To this end we have applied a multicatalytic cerium photoredox&#8208;based system capable of activating O&#8722;H bonds in lactols to deliver formate esters. The same system is also capable of effecting hydrodecarboxylation and hydrodecarbonylation reactions. Initial mechanistic probes demonstrate atomic chlorine (Cl&#8901;) is generated under the reaction conditions, but substrate activation through cerium&#8208;alkoxides or &#8208;carboxylates cannot be ruled out.

         <title>A New Molybdenum Blue Structure Type: How Uranium Expands this Family of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding uranyl nitrate to a solution that would otherwise crystallize the MB wheel Mo154 instead directed the formation and crystallization of Mo72U8, a new MB structure type. Uranium(IV) can be used as both heterometal and reductant in the formation of Mo90U10 type MB wheels. A dehydration induced phase change leads to formation of a sheet of these wheels connected by uranyl oxygen to molybdenum bonds, the first reported of their kind.







Abstract
The assembly of molybdenum polyoxometalates (POMs) has afforded large discrete nanoclusters with varied degrees of reduction such as the ~20&#8201;% reduced molybdenum blues. While many heterometals have been incorporated into these clusters to afford new properties, uranium has yet to be reported. Here we report the first uranium containing molybdenum blue clusters and the unique properties exhibited by this incorporation. The uranyl ion (UO22+) directs formation of Mo72U8, a square POM comprised of two faces connected by eight edge&#8208;sharing molybdenum dimers. Mo72U8, a chiral cluster, crystallizes as a racemic mixture and, in the solid state, has a &#8216;negative&#8217; charge localized on one face of the cluster opposite the &#8216;positively&#8217; charged face of another cluster. Using U(IV) as both heterometal and molybdenum reductant afforded crystals of Mo97U10, a wheel cluster with a heptamolybdate cap on one face. Mo97U10 dissociates in solution, losing the heptamolybdate, to form Mo90U10. Using more solvent during synthesis afforded crystals of Mo90U10S4 which, instead of heptamolybdate, contains four sulfate ions. Crystals of Mo90U10S4 undergo a dehydration induced phase change where clusters form a sheet through oxide bridges. Half of the bridges are cation&#8208;cation interactions between the uranyl oxygen atom and molybdenum, the first reported of this kind.

Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) analogues of Wittig hydrocarbon, [(NHC)(Stil)(NHC)] (3a&#8208;c) (NHC = SIPr (1a) = C[N(Dipp)CH2]2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr (1b) = C[N(Dipp)CH]2; Me&#8208;IPr (1c) = C[N(Dipp)CMe]2 and Stil = C6H4CHCHC6H4) have been reported as crystalline solids. 3a&#8208;c are prepared by two&#8208;electron reductions of the corresponding bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;imidazoli(ni)um bromides [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)](Br)2 (2a&#8208;c) with KC8 in &gt;94&#8201;% yields. 2a&#8208;c are accessible by the nickel catalyzed direct C&#8722;C coupling of NHCs (1a&#8208;c) with (E)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;dibromostilbene. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3a,b yields the corresponding radical cations [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)]B(C6F5)4 4a,b. All compounds have been characterized by UV&#8208;Vis/NMR/EPR spectroscopy as well as 2a, 3a, and 3b by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of representative systems have been analyzed by quantum chemical calculations.

A new series of ferroelectric molecular crystals is described: the methoxyphenyl acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines with Y=F (1), Cl (2), Br (3), or I (4). The crystals of 1&#8211;4 not only exhibit the desired polar stacking of beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs), but the results exceed expectations. Crystals 1&#8211;4 feature planar biphenyl moieties enhancing PBAM stability and NLO performance. Avoiding interlayer halogen bonding allows perfect polar stacking of PBAMs of fluoroazine 1. Chloroazine 2 presents a unique case of a kryptoracemate due to conformational helicity. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Glaser and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400182).

The ancient Eastern legend of master swordsmiths Gan Jiang and Mo Ye recounts their creation of legendary blades through a harmonious blend of raw materials, skilled craftsmanship, and the application of intense physical energy. The depicted process mirrors this fusion of elements, as the mechanical energy applied to magnesium, akin to the smiths&#8242; hammer strikes, triggers a transformative catalytic reaction that yields chemically enriched 2&#8208;arylindoles.

         <title>Expanding Chemical Frontiers: Approaches for Generating Diverse and Bioactive Natural Product&#8208;Like Compounds Libraries from Extracts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining natural and synthetic chemical spaces is achievable through the generation of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; that incorporate structural elements from natural and synthetic precursors, by directly chemically modifying natural extracts. The review provides insights into this approach, covering alterations from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling, and highlighting achievements, promises and technical challenges in the field.







Abstract
The realms of natural products and synthetic compounds exhibit distinct chemical spaces that not only differ but also complement each other. While the convergence of these two domains has been explored through semisynthesis and conventional pharmacomodulation endeavours applied to natural frameworks, a recent and innovative approach has emerged that involves the combinatorial generation of libraries of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; (NPLCs) through the direct synthetic derivatization of natural extracts. This has led to the production of numerous NPLCs that incorporate structural elements from both their natural (multiple saturated rings, oxygen content, chiral centres) and synthetic (aromatic rings, nitrogen and halogen content, drug&#8208;like properties) precursors. Through careful selection of extracts and reagents, specific bioactivities have been achieved, and this strategy has been deployed in various ways, showing great promise without reaching its full potential to date. This review seeks to provide an overview of reported examples involving the chemical engineering of extracts, showcasing a spectrum of natural product alterations spanning from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling. It also includes an analysis of the accomplishments, perspectives and technical challenges within this field.

This review examines mono&#8208;alkylation methodologies targeting key nitrogen moieties in organic building blocks and pharmaceuticals. Focusing on chemical precision in drug discovery, it addresses challenges in achieving one&#8208;pot mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylations, emphasizing sustainable alternatives to traditional alkylating agents. Categorized by alkylating agent type, the review guides researchers in selecting suitable methods for mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylation.







Abstract
This review provides a comprehensive overview of mono&#8208;alkylation methodologies targeting crucial nitrogen moieties &#8211; amines, amides, and sulfonamides &#8211; found in organic building blocks and pharmaceuticals. Emphasizing the intersection of chemical precision with drug discovery, the central challenge addressed is achieving one&#8208;pot mono&#8208;selective short&#8208;chain N&#8208;alkylations (methylations, ethylations, and n&#8208;propylations), preventing undesired overalkylation. Additionally, sustainable, safe, and benign alternatives to traditional alkylating agents, including alcohols, carbon dioxide, carboxylic acids, nitriles, alkyl phosphates, quaternary ammonium salts, and alkyl carbonates, are explored. This review, categorized by the nature of the alkylating agent, aids researchers in selecting suitable methods for mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylation.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transformations for the Construction of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 26, May 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of asymmetric carbene reactions for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary center have been summarized: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization process.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic carbene reactions have been well documented in the last few decades for the expeditious assembly of chiral molecules with structural diversity. However, the enantioselective construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a challenge in this area. In this review article, two types of asymmetric carbene reactions that beyond cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, and B&#252;chner reaction, have been summarized for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization reaction. Especially, the asymmetric metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation process, which has emerged as a practical and versatile method for the expeditious assembly of complex architectures from readily available chemical resources, is a complementary approach for the expeditious assembly of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.

The Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction provided a powerful method for the preparation of various chiral compounds containing an allylic moiety. Chiral palladium/phosphine complex efficiently promoted a wide range of difunctionalization of 1,n&#8208;dienes (n=2&#8211;4) for constructing C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N) bond simultaneously. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and highlights the significant achievements.







Abstract
Transition&#8211;metal catalyzed tandem asymmetric reactions were powerful tools to access various chiral compounds. Many strategies have been developed for the coupling of 1,n&#8208;dienes with aryl halides via a tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost process. However, the control of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemistry remains a challenging task. This minireview details the recent advances in the field of asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions catalyzed by palladium complex, which have opened new opportunities and expanded our understanding in this area of research in recent years.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Azines are fundamentally different in that their helicity is a function of the N&#8722;N bond conformation and chirality results in the absence of chiral centers.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202400182).

Invited for the cover of this issue are Harmeet Bhoday, Nathan Knotts, and Rainer Glaser at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Joe Miner, the university mascot, is a silent and honorary co&#8208;author and personifies the spirit of the old west and the determination to succeed (our emphasis). The image depicts one (MeO&#8208;Ph, Y)&#8208;azine molecule and a model of a perfectly polar stacked bilayer. The floodlight illumination presents a graphic metaphor of second&#8208;harmonic generation (frequency doubling) by the crystalline ferroelectric materials.

         <title>The Complete Assessment of Small Molecule and Peptidomimetic Inhibitors of Sortase A Towards Antivirulence Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA). Sortase A (SrtA) is a critical virulence factor present ubiquitously in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria of which many are considered pathogenic. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells, by anchoring extracellular matrix&#8208;binding proteins to the bacterial outer cell wall. By targeting virulence factors, effective treatment can be achieved, without inducing antibiotic resistance to the treatment. All in all, this would lead to a more sustainable, long&#8208;term approach to treating bacterial infections, including ones that display multiple resistance to current therapeutics. Currently, it appears there are many promising approaches available that have the potential to advance into further clinical development, with peptidomimetic and in vivo active small molecules among the most promising. There are currently no approved drugs on the market targeting SrtA, despite its promise, adding to the relevance of this review article, as it extends to the pharmaceutical industry additionally to academic researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>Telescoped Flow Synthesis of Azacyclic Scaffolds Exploiting the Chromoselective Photolysis of Vinyl Azides and Azirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient chromoselective photochemical process is presented for the synthesis of 2H&#8208;azirines and 1,3&#8208;diazabicylo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;3&#8208;enes from readily available vinyl azides. The method exploits continuous flow photochemistry to enable the safe consumption of the hazardous azide group and provides uniform irradiation using high&#8208;power LEDs at 365&#8208;450 nm. Additionally, a scaled telescoped process has been developed providing access to drug&#8208;like 1,6&#8208;dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines via integrated ring&#8208;expansion and oxidation reactions. Given the prevalence of various azacyclic targets in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials applications it is anticipated that this methodology will enable further exploitations of these important scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient and Scalable &#8220;Second Generation&#8221; Total Synthesis of the Marine Polyketide Limaol Endowed with Antiparasitic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cluster of four skipped exo&#8208;methylene substituents on the &#8220;northern&#8221; wing of limaol renders this marine natural product unique in structural terms. This arguably non&#8208;thermodynamic array gains kinetic stability by populating conformations which impede isomerization to a partly or fully conjugated polyene. This analysis suggested that the difficulties encountered in our first total synthesis had not been caused by an overly fragile character of this unusual substructure; rather, an unfavorable steric microenvironment about the spirotricyclic core was accountable. To remedy the issue, the bulky silyl ethers were replaced by acetates; this simple change allowed all problems to be addressed, the overall yield to be multiplied, and the material throughput to be increased more than eighty&#8208;fold per run. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success was a gold&#8208;catalyzed spirocyclization reaction; the reasons why a Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalyst is needed and the origin of the excellent levels of selectivity were delineated. The modified protecting group pattern also allowed for a much&#8208;improved fragment coupling process by a reagent controlled asymmetric allylation. Finally, a new route to the &#8220;northern&#8221; sector was established by leveraging the power of asymmetric hydrogenation of a 2&#8208;pyrone derivative. Limaol was found to combine appreciable antiparasitic activity with very modest cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have established a facile and efficient protocol for the generation of germyl radicals by employing photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using a catalytic amount of EDA complex of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds simply upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any transition metal or photocatalyst. This protocol also affords silyl radical from silyl hydride.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Metalation on the Ionic TiO2 Surface to Enhance Metal&#8208;CO2 Interaction During Photochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 adsorption on the catalyst&#8217;s surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal&#8208;CO2] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO2 nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]x@TiO2), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs&#8217; charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cux[POM]@TiO2). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO2 core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs&#8217; surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo&#8208;harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of CuII/I and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction potentials. Photochemical CO2 reduction with Cux[POM]@TiO2 results in 30 &#181;mol gcat.&#8208;1 CO (79%) and 8 &#181;mol gcat&#8208;1 of CH4 (21%).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 adsorption on the catalyst&#8217;s surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal-CO2] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO2 nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]x@TiO2), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs&#8217; charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cux[POM]@TiO2). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO2 core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs&#8217; surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo-harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of CuII/I and multi-electron CO2 reduction potentials. Photochemical CO2 reduction with Cux[POM]@TiO2 results in 30 &#181;mol gcat.-1 CO (79%) and 8 &#181;mol gcat-1 of CH4 (21%). Quasi-in-situ Raman study provides evidence in support of CO2 adsorption on the Cux[POM]@TiO2 surface. 13C and D2O labeling studies validates the {Cu-[CO2]-} adduct formation. Despite the photo-harvesting ability of Nax[POM]@TiO2 itself, the poor CO2 adsorption ability of sodium ions highlights the crucial role of copper ion CO2 photo-reduction. Characterization of the {M-[&#951;2-CO2]-} species via surface tuning validates the CO2 activation and photochemical reduction pathway proposed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterizing the oligomers distribution along the aggregation pathway of amyloid A&#223;1&#8208;40 by NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study delves into the early aggregation process of the A&#946;1&#8208;40 amyloid peptide, elucidating the associated oligomers distribution. Motivated by the acknowledged role of small oligomers in the neurotoxic damage linked to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, we present an experimental protocol for preparing 26&#8208;O&#8208;acyl isoA&#946;1&#8208;40, a modified A&#946;1&#8208;40 peptide facilitating rapid isomerization to the native amide form at neutral pH. This ensures seed&#8208;free solutions, minimizing experimental variability. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of coupling NMR diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) with the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) reconstruction method, for effective characterization of early aggregation processes. This innovative approach efficiently maps oligomers distributions across a wide spectrum of initial peptide concentrations offering unique insights into the evolution of oligomers relative populations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach assessing the impact of Epigallocathechin gallate, a known remodeling agent of amyloid fibrils, on the oligomeric distributions of aggregated A&#223;1&#8208;40. The DOSY&#8208;ILT proposed approach stands as a robust and discriminating asset, providing a powerful strategy for rapidly gaining insight into potential inhibitors&#8217; impact on the aggregation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Porous Aromatic Frameworks Embedding Polyoxometalates for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are promising functional porous solids known for their feasible amenability and extraordinary stability. When the framework&#160;modified by ionic functional groups, the given ionic PAFs (iPAFs) exhibited charged channels for adsorption, separation and catalysis. However, the surface areas of ionic porous frameworks are usually lower than the neutral ones, and their synthesis limited by specific strategies and complex modifying processes. To overcome these problems, we proposed an intuitive route to construct ionic porous framework with high specific surface area, through a multivariable synthesis strategy. Herein, multivariate ionic porous aromatic framework (MTV&#8208;iPAFs) material named PAF&#8208;270 was synthesized from readily available building units with ionic functional groups. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited hierarchical structure with the highest specific surface area among reported imidazolium functionalized PAFs. Leveraging its physical and chemical properties, we explored its availability for polyoxometalates loading and heterogeneous catalysis. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited high adsorption capacity up to 50% for both H3O40PW12 (HPW) and (NH4)5H6PV8Mo4O40 (V8). HPW@PAF&#8208;270 and V8@PAF&#8208;270 exhibited excellent catalytic abilities for oleic acid esterification and extractive oxidative desulfurization, respectively. Due to the stability of PAFs, these materials also showed remarkable resistance to temperature and pH changes. These results highlight the potential application of MTV&#8208;iPAFs as functional porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ytterbium(II) Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Single and Double Hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Enynes with the conjugated alkene and alkyne moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry. However, neither 4,1&#8208;hydrophosphination nor dihydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes has been reported. In this paper,&#160;the divalent ytterbium and calcium amide complexes supported by silaimine&#8208;functionalized cyclopentadiene ligands (C5Me4&#8208;Si(L)=NR) were developed, which successfully catalyzed the efficient single and double hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphines. These two hydrophosphination reactions selectively produced homoallenyl phosphines and (E)&#8208;propenylene diphosphines, respectively. This work demonstrated the potential of hemilabile silaimine&#8208;Cp ligands in supporting the efficient and selective rare&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth catalysts.</dc:description>

Additional in vivo experiments using such a modified peptide show there is a general tolerance of biarylitide crosslinking P450 enzymes for histidine to tryptophan mutations within their minimal peptide substrate sequences despite the lack of such residues noted in natural biarylitide gene clusters. This work further highlights the impressive ability of P450s from biarylitide biosynthesis pathways as biocatalysts for the formation of a range of sidechain crosslinked tripeptides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In 1977 Weiss and Grimes, by means of mass spectrometry and 1H and 11B NMR spectroscopy, proposed two structures (I and II) for the ferraborane (&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe(B5H10), isoelectronic with ferrocene. In this work, by means of high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations, we confirm the experimental structures of the two isomers with their corresponding energies, and assign the reported 1H and 11B NMR chemical shifts. A striking result from this study is the planarization (3D &#8594; 2D) of the B5H10&#8211; ligand &#8208; an unknown isolated anion, isoelectronic with aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion C5H5&#8211; &#8208; when attached to the (&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe+ moiety, thus resulting in a more stable ferraborane isomer II.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Axially chiral  cycloalkylidenes are interesting but less developedaxially chiral molecules. Here, a bispidine&#8208;based chiral amine catalytic system was developed to promote efficiently the asymmetric Knoevenagel condensation ofN&#8208;protected oxindoles and benzofuranones with 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones. A variety of alkylidenecycloalkanes with stable axial chirality were obtained in good yields with high er. Based on the absolute configuration determination of product and DFT calculations, a possible mechanism of stereoselective induction was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Catalytic Approach for the Synthesis of Peptide&#8211;Oligonucleotides Conjugates in Aqueous Solution or On&#8208;Column</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8211;oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs) are covalent architectures composed of a DNA or RNA molecules linked to a peptide. These constructs have found widespread applications ranging from hybrid nanomaterials to gene&#8208;targeted therapies. Considering the important role of POCs, a new catalytic approach for their preparation is reported here, that could be applied either on solid support in anhydrous media, or post&#8208;synthetically in aqueous buffer. Single amino acids, peptides and cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) were conjugated to various oligo(ribo)nucleotides with high conversions and good isolated yields. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on more than 35 examples including an analogue of a commercial therapeutic oligonucleotide. Other conjugation partners, such as deoxycholic acid and biotin were also successfully conjugated to oligonucleotides. To highlight the potential of this catalytic approach, these conditions have been applied to iterative processes, which is of high interest for the development of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopy and Photochemistry of [Al, N, C, O, H]: Connectivity to Aluminium&#8208;Bearing Species in the Universe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminium is one of the most abundant metals in the universe and impacts the evolution of various astrophysical environments. Currently detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules represent only a small fraction of the aluminium budget, suggesting that aluminium may reside in other species. AlO and AlOH molecules are abundant in the oxygen&#8208;rich supergiant stars such as VY Canis Majoris, a stellar molecular factory with 60+ molecules including the prebiotic NC&#8208;bearing species. Additional Al&#8208;bearing molecules with N, C, O, and H may form in O&#8208;rich environments with radiation&#8208;accelerated chemistry. Here, we present spectroscopic identification of novel aluminium&#8208;bearing molecules composed of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] from the reactions of Al atoms and HNCO in solid argon matrix, which are potential Al&#8208;bearing molecules in space. Photoinduced transformations among six [Al, N, C, O, H] isomers and three [Al, N, C, O] isomers, along with their dissociation reactions forming the known interstellar species, have been disclosed. These results provide new insight into the chemical network of astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing species in space.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous proton batteries have received increasing attention due to their outstanding rate performance, stability and high capacity. However, the selection of anode materials in strongly acidic electrolytes poses a challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous proton batteries. This study optimized the proton reaction kinetics of layered metal oxide WO3 by introducing interlayer structured water and coating polyaniline on its surface to prepare organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material (WO3&#183;2H2O@PANI). We constructed an aqueous proton battery with WO3&#183;2H2O@PANI anode and MnO2@GF cathode. After 1500 cycles at a current density of 10 A g&#8208;1, the capacity retention rate can still reach 80.2%. These results can inspire the development of new aqueous proton batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Manganese is currently experiencing a great deal of attention in homogeneous catalysis as a sustainable alternative to platinum group metals due to its abundance, affordable price and low toxicity. While homogeneous nitrogen fixation employing well&#8208;defined transition metal complexes has been an important area of research in coordination chemistry, manganese derivatives have been only sporadically used in this research area. In this contribution, the authors systematically cover manganese organometallic chemistry related to N2 activation spanning almost 60 years, identify apparent pitfalls and outline encouraging perspectives for its future development.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;diboration of 1,3&#8208;butadiynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diborylalkenes are useful building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and organic materials. We demonstrate a metal&#8208;free phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cis&#8208;diboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes with B2pin2 to afford cis&#8208;diboryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes in good yields with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 Z/E selectivity). The diboration product can be conveniently transformed into densely functionalized 1,3&#8208;enynes.

Trialkyl phosphines PMe3 and PEt3 catalyze the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;diboration of 1,3&#8208;butadiynes to give 1,2&#8208;diboryl enynes. The products were utilized to synthesize 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetraaryl enynes using a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura protocol and can readily undergo proto&#8208;deborylation.

&lt;p&gt;Diborylalkenes are useful building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and organic materials. We demonstrate a metal-free phosphine-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diboration of 1,3-diynes with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to afford &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diboryl-1,3-enynes in good yields with high regio- and stereo-selectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and &amp;gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; selectivity). The diboration product can be conveniently transformed into densely functionalized 1,3-enynes.

         <title>Regulation Strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction performance. Regulation strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C or Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts are summarized in this Review from 5 perspectives: (1)&#8197;coordinated atoms, (2)&#8197;environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3)&#8197;dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4)&#8197;metal&#8208;based particle promoters, and (5)&#8197;curved carbon layers.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and alkaline membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have received great attention as energy devices of the next generation. Accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics is the key to improve PEMFC and AEMFC performance. Platinum&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used catalysts for the ORR, but their high price and low abundance limit the commercialization of fuel cells. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) is considered to be the most likely material class to replace Pt&#8208;based catalysts, among which Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic ORR performance and have made great progress in the past decades. With the improvement of synthesis technology and a deeper understanding of the ORR mechanism, some reported Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts have shown excellent ORR activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Inspired by the progress, regulation strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts are summarized in this Review from 5&#8197;perspectives: (1)&#8197;coordinated atoms, (2)&#8197;environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3)&#8197;dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4)&#8197;metal&#8208;based particle promoters, and (5)&#8197;curved carbon layers. We also make suggestions on some challenges facing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C research.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design and Synthesis of Lipid A Derivatives to Modulate Cytokine Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on co&#8208;crystal structure of LPS with TLR4&#8208;MD2, a range of bis&#8208; and monophosphoryl lipid A derivatives was designed and synthesized to probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of the proximal glucosamine for inducing the production of a wide variety of cytokines by human monocytes.







Abstract
Agonists of Toll like receptors (TLRs) have attracted interest as adjuvants and immune modulators. A crystal structure of TLR4/MD2 with E. coli LPS indicates that the fatty acid at C&#8208;2 of the lipid A component of LPS induces dimerization of two TLR4&#8208;MD2 complexes, which in turn initiates cell signaling leading to the production of (pro)inflammatory cytokines. To probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of lipid A, a range of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;phosphoryl lipid A derivatives with different modifications at C&#8208;2 were prepared by a strategy in which 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl ethers were employed as permanent protecting group that could be readily removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The C&#8208;2 amine was protected as 9&#8208;fluorenylmethyloxycarbamate, which at a later stage could be removed to give a free amine that was modified by different fatty acids. LPS and the synthetic lipid As induced the same cytokines, however, large differences in activity were observed. A compound having a hexanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 still showed agonistic properties, but further shortening to a butanoyl abolished activity. The modifications had a larger influence on monophosphoryl lipid As. The lipid As having a butanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 could selectively antagonize TRIF associated cytokines induced by LPS or lipid A.

         <title>Construction of Ultrafine PtIr Clusters Supported on Co3O4 Nanoflowers for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fabricating the combination of ultrafine PtIr nanoclusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires, the as&#8208;obtained PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 hybrid catalysts exhibit OER/HER and overall water splitting performances superior to the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts, owing to the heterogeneous structure, ultrafine metal clusters and strong interaction between noble metal and transition metal species.







Abstract
Green hydrogen production through electrochemical overall water splitting has suffered from sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, inferior conversion efficiency, and high cost. Herein, ultrafine PtIr clusters are synthesized via an electrodeposition method and decorated on the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires (PtIr&#8208;Co3O4). The encouraging performances in electrochemical OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are achieved over the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst, with the overpotentials as low as 410 and 237&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Due to the ultralow loading of PtIr clusters, the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst exhibits 1270&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 for OER at the overpotential of 400&#8197;mV. Our detailed analyses also show that the strong interactions between the ultrafine PtIr clusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers enable the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst to afford 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting at the potential of 1.57&#8197;V, accompanied by high durability for 100&#8197;h.

         <title>External Electric Field Control of Exciton Motion in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrins excel as light&#8208;harvesting complexes, but their unsuitability for photovoltaics stems from poor transport properties causing significant exciton loss. While arranging them in surface&#8208;anchored metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PP&#8208;SURMOFs) aids charge carrier dissociation, it doesn&#8242;t notably enhance conductivity. To address this, we propose guiding exciton diffusion indirectly with an external electric field. Fields as low as 0.1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1 induce a Stark effect, reducing band gaps in PP&#8208;SURMOFs. Applied as a gradient, this creates a unidirectional hopping pathway, potentially reducing exciton diffusion lengths and enhancing their utility in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Porphyrins are excellent light&#8208;harvesting complexes. Presently they are unsuitable for photovoltaic applications, as their excellent light absorbance is compensated to a large extent by their poor transport properties, where most excitons are lost by recombination. Arranging porphyrins in regular, strongly bound, lattices of surface&#8208;anchored metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PP&#8208;SURMOFs) may facilitate charge carrier dissociation, but does not significantly enhance the conductive properties. In most cases, photogenerated excitons traverse undirected, Brownian motion through a hopping process, resulting in a substantial diffusion length to reach electrodes, leading to significant exciton loss through recombination. Here, we propose to guide exciton diffusion indirectly by an external electric field. We show that electric fields, even as strong as 1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1, do not affect the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of the porphyrins. However, fields of 0.1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1 and even less demonstrate a notable Stark effect, with slight band gap reductions, for some PP&#8208;SURMOFs. When applied as an electric field gradient, for instance, via the substrate, it creates a unidirectional hopping pathway for the excitons. Consequently, we expect a significant reduction of exciton diffusion length leading to increased utilization of photogenerated excitons as they reach the electrodes. This strategy holds promise for integrating photoactive molecules in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>A Fluorination Strategy and Low&#8208;Acidity Anchoring Group in Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two self&#8208;assembled hole transport materials with low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid, and a fluorination strategy have been developed. With the new hole transport materials, high&#8208;performance PSCs were fabricated with high&#8208;quality perovskite layer and excellent interfacial contacts, and a champion PCE of 20.32&#8201;% was achieved with remarkably enhanced stability.







Abstract
Herein, we synthesized two donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type small organic molecules with self&#8208;assembly properties, namely MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA and MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA, both containing a low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid. After systematically investigation, it is found that, with the fluorination, the MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA demonstrates a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, higher hole mobility, higher hydrophobicity and stronger interaction with the perovskite layer than that of MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA. As a result, the device based&#8208;on MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA displays a better crystallization and morphology of perovskite layer with larger grain size and less non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the device using MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA as hole transport material achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.32&#8201;% and remarkable stability. After being kept in an N2 glove box for 116&#8197;days, the unsealed PSCs&#8217; device retained 93&#8201;% of its initial PCE. Even exposed to air with a relative humidity range of 30&#177;5&#8201;% for 43&#8197;days, its PCE remained above 91&#8201;% of its initial condition. This study highlights the vital importance of the fluorination strategy combined with a low acidity anchoring group in SAMs, offering a pathway to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>On the Synthesis and Structure of &#8216;Naked&#8217; Ga(I) and In(I) Salts and the Surprising Stability of Simple Ga(I) and In(I) Salts in the Coordinating Solvents Ether and Acetonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free Choices: In this work we introduce a route to solvent&#8208;free &#8216;naked&#8217; GaI and InI salts that may serve as starting materials to introduce GaI and InI to any desired system. Their markedly different structures are compared and analyzed in detail. In addition, the isolation of [M(OEt2)2]+ and [M(MeCN)2]+ (M=Ga, In) complex salts and the limits of stability of MI against disproportionation are explored.







Abstract
In this work, we present the solid&#8208;state structures of solvent&#8208;free Ga[pf] and In[pf] salts ([pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3), which are very rare examples of salts with truly &#8216;naked&#8217; metal cations. Both salts may serve as starting materials for subvalent gallium and indium chemistry with very weakly coordinating ligands providing the freedom of choice for solvents and ligands for the future. On the other hand, we report and rationalize the formation and isolation of [M(OEt2)2][pf] and [M(MeCN)2][pf] (M=Ga, In), underlining the surprising stability of these subvalent group 13&#8197;M+ ions against disproportionation. Unexpectedly, dicoordinate and carbene analogous [M(L)2]+ ions with the [pf]&#8722; counterion are stable in L=acetonitrile and diethyl ether at room temperature, opening up possible applications for example in organic synthesis and catalysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes was developed, which shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity, and broad group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation demonstrates its promising applications in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.







Abstract
Introduction of the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group into organic compounds has garnered substantial interest because of its significant role in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we report a hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated radical process for C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes. The reaction shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), and broad functional group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of bioactive molecules demonstrates its promising application potential. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction follows a radical addition and subsequent elimination pathway.

On&#8208;surface synthesis of heterochiral heptahelicene oligomers via Ullman coupling has been reported. Annealing helicene monomers equipped with spacer linkers and Br ligands on an Au(111) surface in UHV conditions resulted in helicene oligomers with a 100&#8201;% monomer coupling yield. The oligomers were characterized by AFM/STM and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
We report on&#8208;surface synthesis of heterochiral 1D heptahelicene oligomers after deposition of a racemic heptahelicene monomer on an Au(111) surface followed by Ullmann coupling under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Structure, chirality and mode of adsorption of the resulting dimers to octamers are inferred from the scanning probe microscopy and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling Exhibiting Unexpectedly Small Primary Kinetic Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Probing quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in chemical reactions is crucial to understanding and developing new transformations. Primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) beyond the semiclassical maximum values of 7&#8210;10 (room temperature) are commonly used to assess substantial QMT contributions in one&#8208;step hydrogen transfer reactions, because of the much greater QMT probability of protium vs. deuterium. Nevertheless, we report here the discovery of a reaction model occurring exclusively by H&#8208;atom QMT with residual primary H/D KIEs. A 2&#8208;hydroxyphenylnitrene, generated in N2 matrix, was found to isomerize to an imino&#8208;ketone via sequential (domino) QMT involving anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization (rate determining step) and [1,4]&#8208;H shift reactions. These sequential QMT transformations were also observed in the OD&#8208;deuterated sample, and unexpected primary H/D KIEs between 3 and 4 were measured at 3 to 20 K. Analogous residual primary H/D KIEs were found in the anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization QMT of 2&#8208;cyanophenol in a N2 matrix. Evidence strongly indicates that these intriguing isotope&#8208;insensitive QMT reactivities arise due to the solvation effects of the N2 matrix medium, putatively through coupling with the moving H/D tunneling particle. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocompatible Synthesis of Macrocyclic Thiazol(in)e Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic peptides containing a thiazole or thiazoline in the backbone are considered privileged structures in both natural compounds and drug discovery, owing to their enhanced bioactivity, stability, and permeability. Here, we present the biocompatible synthesis of macrocyclic peptides from N&#8208;terminal cysteine and C&#8208;terminal nitrile. While the N&#8208;terminal cysteine is incorporated during solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, the C&#8208;terminal nitrile is introduced during cleavage with aminoacetonitrile, utilizing a cleavable benzotriazole linker. This method directly yields the fully functionalized linear peptide precursor. The biocompatible cyclization reaction occurs in buffer at physiological pH and room temperature. The resulting thiazoline heterocycle remains stable in buffer but hydrolyzes under acidic conditions. While such hydrolysis enables access to macrocyclic peptides with a complete amide backbone, mild oxidation of the thiazoline leads to the stable thiazole macrocyclic peptide. While conventional oxidation strategies involve metals, we developed a protocol simply relying on alkaline salt and air. Therefore, we offer a rapid and metal&#8208;free pathway to macrocyclic thiazole peptides, featuring a biocompatible key cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazole&#8208;functionalized Organoboranes Exhibiting Dynamic Intramolecular N&#8594;B&#8208;Coordination and Cyanide&#8208;selective Anion Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from two different cyano&#8208;functionalized organoboranes, we demonstrate that 1,3&#8208;dipolar [3+2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition can serve to generate libraries of alkyl&#8208;tetrazole&#8208;functionalized compounds capable of intramolecular N&#224;B&#8208;Lewis adduct formation. Due to the relatively low basicity of tetrazoles, structures can be generated that exhibit weak and labile N&#224;B&#8208;coordination. The reaction furnishes 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;alkylated regio&#8208;isomers that exhibit different effective Lewis&#8208;acidities at the boron centers, and vary in their optical absorption and fluorescence properties. Indeed, we identified derivatives capable of selectively binding cyanide over fluoride, as confirmed by 11B NMR. This finding demonstrates the potentialities of this synthetic strategy to systematically fine&#8208;tune the properties of lead structures that are of interest as chemical sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain boundary defect engineering in rutile iridium oxide boosts efficient and stable acidic water oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PEMWE&#160;is considered a promising technology for coupling with renewable energy sources to achieve clean hydrogen production. However, constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic OER&#160;and the acidic abominable environment render the grand challenges in developing the active and stable OER electrocatalyst, leading to low efficiency of PEMWE. Herein, we develop the rutile&#8208;type IrO2 nanoparticles with abundant grain boundaries and the continuous nanostructure through the joule heating and sacrificial template method. DFT calculations verified that grain boundaries can modulate the electronic structure of Ir sites and optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, resulting in the accelerated kinetics. The 350&#8208;IrO2&#160;affords a rapid OER process with 20 times higher mass activity (0.61 A mgIr&#8208;1) than the commercial IrO2 at 1.50 V vs. RHE. Benefiting from the reduced overpotential and the preservation of the stable rutile structure, 350&#8208;IrO2 exhibits the stability of 200 h test at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with only trace decay of 11.8 mV. Moreover, the assembled PEMWE with anode 350&#8208;IrO2 catalyst outputs the current density up to 2 A cm&#8208;2 with only 1.84 V applied voltage, long&#8208;term operation for 100 h without obvious performance degradation at 1 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Engineering of Acridine Donor to Optimize Color Purity of Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>9,9&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) is one of the most widely used electron donor for constructing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, DMAC&#8208;based emitters often suffer from the imperfect color purity, particularly in blue emitters, due to its strong electron&#8208;donating capability. To modulate donor strength, 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC were designed by introducing the electron&#8208;withdrawing 2&#8208;fluorophenyl and 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl at the 2,7&#8208;positions of DMAC. These donors were used, in combination with 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor, to develop novel TADF emitters 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ. Compared to the F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;free reference emitter, both two emitters showed hypsochromic effect in fluorescence and comparable photoluminescence quantum yields without sacrificing the reverse intersystem crossing rate constants. In particular, 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ based OLED exhibited a blue shift by up to 39 nm and significantly improved Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.36, 0.55) to (0.22, 0.41), while the external quantum efficiency kept stable at about 22.5%. This donor engineering strategy should be valid for improving the color purity of large amount of acridine based TADF emitters. It can be predicted that pure blue TADF emitters should be feasible if these F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;modifed acridine donors are combined with other weaker electron acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Performance&#160;of Bio&#8208;Based Amphoteric Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the global surfactant market continues to expand, there is an increasing need to develop bio&#8208;based alternatives in the shift towards a circular economy. This study focuses on the synthesis of polar, amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide surfactants starting from biomass&#8208;derived monosaccharides and demonstrating their potential in various applications. The synthesis involved a reductive amination of the sugars with an alkylamine and formaldehyde followed by oxidation to produce N&#8208;oxide surfactants. These bio&#8208;based surfactants exhibited promising properties, including high solubility, foamability, surface tension reduction, and critical micelle concentration. In particular, N&#8208;GalA1.10 and N&#8208;GalA1.12 showed comparable performance to commercial surfactants. Furthermore, these bio&#8208;based surfactants demonstrated significantly lower skin irritation potential when compared to petrochemical&#8208;derived counterparts like sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), making them potentially suitable for personal care products. The biodegradability assessment revealed that N&#8208;GalA1.12 exhibited good biodegradation, indicating its potential environmental compatibility. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of bio&#8208;based N&#8208;oxide surfactants derived from monosaccharides as sustainable and skin&#8208;friendly alternatives to traditional amphoteric surfactants, like cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB)</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxy Resins with Controllable "Thermally Conductive&#8208;Self&#8208;Healing" Synergies: a New Material to Meet the Needs of Flexible Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the popularization of 5G technology and artificial intelligence, thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials. Although many compounds containing both performances have been synthesized, there is little systematic theory to explain this coordination mechanism. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies for discussing the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. A series of electronic&#8208;grade biphenyl epoxies (4,4'&#8208;bis(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (1), 4,4'&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (2), 4,4'&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (3), and 4,4'&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)butoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (4) were synthesized and characterized. Furthermore, they were cured with decanedioic acid to produce polymers. Results showed that alkyl chains can both affect the two properties, and the epoxies suitable for specific application scenarios can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. In terms of thermal conductivity, compound 1 was a most promising material. However, compound 4 was expected to be utilized in flexible electronic devices because of its acceptable thermal conductivity, self&#8208;healing ability, transparency, and flexibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Novel Water&#8208;Soluble Cationic Platinum(II) Organometallic Complexes with Phenanthroline and Imidazolic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents are widely used in the treatment of cancer. However, their effectiveness is limited by severe adverse reactions, drug resistance, and poor water solubility. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of new water&#8208;soluble cationic monofunctional platinum(II) complexes starting from the [PtCl(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)] (1, phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) precursor, specifically [Pt(NH3)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (2), [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (3), and [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (4), which deviate from traditional requirements for antitumor activity. These complexes were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects in comparison to cisplatin, using immortalized cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), human renal carcinoma cells (Caki&#8208;1), and normal human renal cells (HK&#8208;2). While complex 2 showed minimal effects on the cell lines, complexes 3 and 4 demonstrated higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin. Notably, complex 4 displayed the highest cytotoxicity in both cancer and normal cell lines. However, complex 3 exhibited the highest selectivity for renal tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) among the tested complexes, compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2). This resulted in a significantly higher selectivity than that of cisplatin and complex 4. Therefore, complex 3 shows potential as a leading candidate for the development of a new generation of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, utilizing biocompatible imidazole ligands while demonstrating promising anticancer properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthracene carboximides (ACIs) conjugated with gluco&#8208;, galacto&#8208; and mannopyranosides are synthesized, by glycosylation of N&#8208;hydroxyethylanthracene carboximide acceptor with glycosyl donors.&#160; Glycoconjugation of anthracene carboximide increases the aq. solubility by more than 3&#8208;fold.&#160; The glycoconjugates display red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, as compared to anthracene.&#160;&#160; Large Stokes shift (&#955;abs/ &#955;em = 445/525 nm) and high fluorescence quantum yields (&#1060;) of 0.86 and 0.5 occur in THF and water, respectively. The ACI&#8208;glycosides undergo facile photodimerization in aqueous solutions, leading to the formation of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer, as a mixture of syn and anti&#8208;isomers.&#160; Solution phase and solid&#8208;state characterizations by dynamic light scattering (DLS), microscopic imaging by atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopies reveal self&#8208;assembled vesicle structures of ACI glycosides. These self&#8208;assembled structures act as multivalent glycoclusters for ligand&#8208;specific lectin binding, as evidenced by the binding of Man&#8208;ACI to Con A, by fluorescence and turbidity assays. The conjugates do not show cellular cytotoxicity (IC50) till concentrations of 50 &#956;M with HeLa and HepG2 cell lines and are cell&#8208;permeable, showing strong fluorescence inside the cells.&#160; These properties enable the glycoconjugates to be used in cell imaging. The non&#8208;selective cellular uptake of the glycoconjugates suggests a passive diffusion through the membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/Polyimide Mixed Matrix Membrane for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A&#160;novel defect&#8208;engineered MOF (quasi ZrFum or Q&#8208;ZrFum) was synthesized via a controlled thermal deligandation process and incorporated into a CO2&#8208;philic 6FDA&#8208;durene polyimide (PI) matrix to form Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded MMMs. Defect&#8208;engineered MOFs and fabricated MMMs were investigated in terms of their characteristic properties and separation performance. The incorporation of defects into the MOF structure increases the pore size and provides unsaturated active metal sites that positively affect CO2 molecule transport. After the deligandation process, the interfacial compatibility between the Q&#8208;ZrFum particles and the PI matrix increases, which improves the mechanical strength of Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded membranes. MMM containing 5 wt.% of defect&#8208;engineered Q&#8208;ZrFum exhibits excellent CO2 permeability of 1308 Barrer which increased by 99% compared to the pure PI membrane (656 Barrer) at a feed pressure of 2 bar. Moreover, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity reached 44 and 26.6 which increased by about 70 and 16%, respectively. This study emphasizes that defect&#8208;engineered MOFs can be promising candidates for use as filler in the preparation of MMMs for the future development of membrane&#8208;based gas separation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for using Quaternary Ammonium Salts as Alternative Reagents in Alkylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines strategies for using quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) as alternative and solid reagents in alkylation reactions, enabling safer chemical synthesis methods for researchers. Unlike traditional reagents, which entail notable health and safety hazards, QAS present a safer alternative, being non&#8208;carcinogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive.







Abstract
Alkylation reactions are pivotal in organic chemistry, with wide&#8208;ranging utilization across various fields of applied synthetic chemistry. However, conventional reagents employed in alkylations often pose substantial health and exposure risks. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) present a promising alternative for these transformations offering significantly reduced hazards as they are non&#8208;cancerogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive. Despite their potential, their use in direct organic transformations remains relatively unexplored. This review outlines strategies for utilizing QAS as alternative reagents in alkylation reactions, providing researchers with safer approaches to chemical synthesis.

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Metallogels: Drug Loading and Eu(III) as Structural Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu(III) is combined with iminodiacetic acid to create luminescent hydrogels, with tunable rheological properties. Utilizing Eu(III) luminescence as a structural probe, we propose molecular structures for the materials. We also assess their capacity for loading bioactive molecules. This research could inspire luminescent hydrogel development for optical and biomedical materials, leveraging Eu(III) luminescence for advanced material characterization.







Abstract
Supramolecular metallogels combine the rheological properties of gels with the color, magnetism, and other properties of metal ions. Lanthanide ions such as Eu(III) can be valuable components of metallogels due to their fascinating luminescence. In this work, we combine Eu(III) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) into luminescent hydrogels. We investigate the tailoring of the rheological properties of these gels by changes in their metal:ligand ratio. Further, we use the highly sensitive Eu(III) luminescence to obtain information about the chemical structure of the materials. In special, we take advantage of computational calculations to employ an indirect method for structural elucidation, in which the simulated luminescent properties of candidate structures are matched to the experimental data. With this strategy, we can propose molecular structures for different EuIDA gels. We also explore the usage of these gels for the loading of bioactive molecules such as OXA, observing that its aldose reductase activity remains present in the gel. We envision that the findings from this work could inspire the development of luminescent hydrogels with tunable rheology for applications such as 3D printing and imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery platforms. Finally, Eu(III) emission&#8208;based structural elucidation could be a powerful tool in the characterization of advanced materials.

         <title>Distinctive Chiral Conformations Induced to Poly (naphthalene&#8211;1,4&#8208;diyl) by Helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective Polymerization and Circularly Polarized Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8211;helical &#8220;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8221; as a novel chiral structure and single&#8211;handed helical conformation as one of the well&#8211;known, ordered chiral structures are induced to poly (naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) by circularly polarized light irradiation and asymmetric polymerization, respectively. The former conformation is stable only in the solid state while the latter resists racemization by aggregation in solution. Both conformations contribute to efficient circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Optically active poly(naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) was prepared through helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization of the corresponding monomers and also through circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation, resulting in distinctive circular dichroism (CD) spectral patterns. Chirality of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization &#8208;based polymer is ascribed to preferred&#8211;handed helicity while that of the CPL&#8211;based polymer to a non&#8211;helical, chiral conformation (&#8216;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8217;) with preferred&#8211;handedness which was stable only in the solid state. The helix of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8211;based polymer gradually racemized in tetrahydrofuran while it was stabilized by aggregate formation in a hexane&#8211;dichloromethane solution. Both helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8208; and CPL&#8211;based polymers exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Dinuclear Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes as Anticancer Drug Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are presented. The metal complexes primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, causing cell death by apoptosis. The lead compound demonstrated to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid upon treatment with micromolar concentrations.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Chemotherapy remains one of the most dominant forms for anticancer treatment. Despite their clinical success, the used chemotherapeutic agents are associated with severe side effect and pharmacological limitations. To overcome these drawbacks there is a need for the development of new types of chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are proposed. The metal complexes were found to be internalized by an energy dependent endocytosis pathway, primary accumulating in the mitochondria. The rhenium(I) complexes demonstrated to induce cell death against a variety of cancer cells in the micromolar range through apoptosis. The lead compound showed to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid at micromolar concentrations.

         <title>Syntheses of &#945;(2,8) Sialosides Containing NeuAc and NeuGc by Using Double Carbonyl&#8208;Protected N&#8208;Acyl Sialyl Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl and N&#8208;glycoyl sialyl donors underwent efficient &#945;(2,8) sialylation in dichloromethane, allowing for the chemical synthesis of &#945;(2,8) disialosides involving the compounds containing both NeuAc and NeuGc. The selective ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;glycolylcarbamate in these sialosides without losing the N&#8208;glycolyl group was accomplished under a lower reaction temperature than that required for N&#8208;acetyl carbamate.







Abstract
We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc&#8208;containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl sialyl donors. The 7&#8208;O,9&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl protection of an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;5&#8208;N,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;protected sialyl donor markedly increased the &#945;&#8208;selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N&#8208;acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N&#8208;acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N&#8208;glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N&#8208;acetyl carbamate due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxygen in the N&#8208;acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N&#8208;glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C&#8208;6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3&#8208;diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.

         <title>Construction of Supramolecular Polymers and Covalent Polymers via the Same Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of monomers were designed, which embodied diazonium salt units and phenolic hydroxyl groups respectively. First, supramolecular polymers were prepared driven by hydrogen bonds between diazonium salt and hydroxyl. Besides, covalent polymers could be obtained upon ultraviolet irradiation followed by the self&#8208;assembly process. In this way, both supramolecular polymers and covalent polymers were successfully synthesized using same monomers.







Abstract
Nature owns the ability to construct structurally different polymers from the same monomers. While polymers can be classified as covalent polymers (CPs) and supramolecular polymers (SPs), it is still difficult to synthesize CPs and SPs using same monomers like nature do. Herein, M1 with two diazo salts on both the ends was designed. Additionally, hydroquinone was chosen to be M2 for the existence of two hydroxyl groups. When mixing at room temperature, M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled to SPs via N&#8230;H hydrogen bonds. In another way, upon the exposure to ultraviolet irradiation when blending M1 with M2, CPs were fabricated in the presence of covalent bonds. The excellent thermal stability of CPs was determined by TGA and DSC, while the great corrosion resistance of covalent polymers was detected by acid or alkali immersion. In this way, constructing two kinds of polymers using the same monomers was successfully achieved. This shows tremendous potential in fields of polymer science, supramolecular chemistry, which would boom the development of polymers.

         <title>Accelerating Cellular Uptake with Unnatural Amino Acid for Inhibiting Immunosuppressive Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrates that the integration of unnatural amino acids (L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine) into peptide assemblies significantly accelerates their accumulation within prostate cancer cells, boosting their capacity to hinder cancer proliferation. This work paves a way for engineering supramolecular medicine, potentially heightening the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based treatments for prostate cancer. It may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for treating other cancers.







Abstract
Targeting immunosuppressive metastatic cancer cells is a key challenge in therapy. We recently have shown that a rigid&#8208;rod aromatic, pBP&#8722;NBD, that responds to enzymes and kill immunosuppressive metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells in mimetic bone microenvironment. However, pBP&#8722;NBD demonstrated moderate efficacy against CRPC cells. To enhance activity, we incorporated the unnatural amino acid L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine (L&#8208; or D&#8722;BiP) into pBP&#8722;NBD, drastically increasing cellular uptake and CRPC inhibition. Specifically, we inserted BiP into pBP&#8722;NBD to target mOS (Saos2 and SJSA1) and CRPC (VCaP and PC3) cells with overexpressed phosphatases. Our results show that the D&#8208;peptide backbone with an aspartate methyl diester at the C&#8208;terminal offers the highest activity against these immunosuppressive mOS and CRPC cells. Importantly, imaging shows that the peptide assemblies almost instantly enter the cells and accumulate primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum of Saos2, SJSA1, and PC3 cells and at the lysosomes of VCaP cells. By using BiP to boost cellular uptake and self&#8208;assembly within cancer cells, this work illustrates an unnatural hydrophobic amino acid as a versatile and effective residue to boost endocytosis of synthetic peptides for intracellular self&#8208;assembly.

         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe for visualizing Zn2+ in biological samples through microscopy has been designed. The probe was inspired by the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein, which was extended with an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline ionophore. A probe&#8211;Zn2+ complex is shown glowing green inside a cell, lighting up the scene and illustrating how the sensor indicates the presence of the ion.

The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative annulation reaction of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium salts with alkynes via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation to obtain &#960;&#8208;expanded imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium derivatives is reported. Methodology is compatible with a wide range of substrate scope including pharmacophere containing scaffolds. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated fused imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium derivatives have been achieved via C&#8722;H activation of quinoline&#8208;functionalized NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) and oxidative coupling with internal alkynes. The reaction occurred with high efficiency, broad substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and utilized into a gram&#8208;scale.

&lt;p&gt;The ruthenium-catalyzed oxidative annulation reaction of imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium salts with alkynes &lt;i&gt;via N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene-directed C&#8722;H activation to obtain &#960;-expanded imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium derivatives is reported. Methodology is compatible with a wide range of substrate scope including pharmacophere containing scaffolds. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation complement the synthetic work.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II)-catalyzed synthesis of &#960;-conjugated fused imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium derivatives have been achieved &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H activation of quinoline-functionalized NHC (NHC&lt;i&gt;=N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene) and oxidative coupling with internal alkynes. The reaction occurred with high efficiency, broad substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and utilized into a gram-scale. Synthetic applications of the coupled product have been exemplified in the late-stage derivatization of various highly functionalized scaffolds. Moreover, most of the annulated products exhibit intense fluorescence and have potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Mechanistic studies have provided insights into the spectroscopic characterization of key five-membered ruthenacycle intermediate and Ru(0) sandwich species. Based on several control experiments, deuterium-kinetic isotope effect, and thermodynamic activation parameters the mechanistic finding demonstrated that fused imidazo-[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium C(2)&#8722;H bond cleavage is the rate-determining step and ruling out the possibility of reductive elimination for controlling the rate of reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extended Reichardt's Dye&#8211;Synthesis and Solvatochromic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new pyridinium phenolate dyes with phenylene &#960;&#8208;extension were synthesised and all exhibited strong negative solvatochromism similar to the well&#8208;known Betaine 30 dye. This contrasts with the &#960;&#8208;extended Betaine 21 previously reported to show poor solvatochromism. We found Betaine 21 to be significantly more solvatochromic than reported, with its alleged insensitivity attributed to degradation in certain solvents.







Abstract
Three new pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes based on the benchmark solvatochromic dye Betaine 30 were synthesised. The dyes contained phenylene spacers between the donor and acceptor groups. Their UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra were measured, with the dyes showing strong negative solvatochromic behaviour comparable to that of Betaine 30. These results stood in contrast to the behaviour of the &#960;&#8208;extended dye Betaine 21, originally reported in 1963. This dye was synthesised and found to be significantly more solvatochromic than previously reported but prone to degrade. All &#960;&#8208;extended dyes synthesised were found to be unstable in certain solvents. Although the increased distance between donor and acceptor did not enhance solvatochromism to the extent predicted, it was still determined that the reduced planarity caused by a phenylene spacer is not as detrimental as believed.

         <title>Elucidation of Design Criteria for V&#8208;based Redox Mediators: Structure&#8208;Function Relationships that Dictate Rates of Heterogeneous Electron Transfer</title>

Structure function relationships of vanadium oxide complexes (V1=[V(acac)3]; V6=[V6O7(OMe)12] or [V6O13(TRISNO2)2]&#8722;3; V18=V18O46(NO3)]&#8722;5) in acetonitrile that dictate heterogeneous rate constants. Elucidation of design criteria for redox mediators.







Abstract
Redox mediators are attractive solutions for addressing the stringent kinetic stipulations required for efficient energy conversion processes. In this work, we compare the electrochemical properties of four vanadium complexes, namely [V(acac)3], [V6O7(OMe)12], [nBu4N]3[V6O13(TRISNO2)2], and [nBu4N]5[V18O46(NO3)] in non&#8208;aqueous solutions on glassy carbon electrodes. The goal of this study is to investigate the electron transfer kinetics and diffusivity of these compounds under identical experimental conditions to develop an understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships that dictate the physicochemical properties of vanadium oxide assemblies. Complex selection was dictated by two criteria &#8211; (1)&#8197;nuclearity of the transition metal complexes (2)&#8197;distribution of electron density in the native electronic configuration. Our analyses establish that electronic communication between metal centers significantly impacts charge transfer kinetics of these vanadium&#8208;based compounds.

         <title>Exploring a De Novo Route to Bradyrhizose: Synthesis and Isomeric Equilibrium of Bradyrhizose Diastereomers&#8800;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8197;novo approach to synthesize d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester is presented. The strategy uses transfer hydrogenation, an Achmatowicz rearrangement and alkene oxidations as key steps in the synthesis. The effect of the configuration at C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;9 on the isomeric composition of the reducing sugars in water was analyzed and compared with the natural product.







Abstract
A de&#8197;novo asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester precursor is described. Key transformations used in the stereodivergent approach include two Noyori asymmetric reductions, an Achmatowicz rearrangement, diastereoselective alkene oxidations, and the first example of a palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of a vinylogous pyranone. The isomeric composition of the bicyclic reducing sugars obtained was analyzed and their behaviour was compared to the natural product, revealing key stereocentres that impact the overall distribution.

         <title>Influence of Lattice Defects on Trans&#8208;Oligoene Substructure Formation in Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Statistical Raman spectroscopy of iodinated graphene reveals a clear correlation between trans&#8208;oligoene substructure&#8208;Raman modes and the number of defects that indicates strong interaction within the graphene lattice. An upper limit of chain length of ~1&#8197;nm was thus determined for substructures probed at 532&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The photochemical reaction of iodine and graphene induces strong new Raman modes due to the formation of trans&#8208;oligoene substructures in graphene domains. This unique reactivity was demonstrated before on defect&#8208;free graphene, however leaving the influence of e.&#8201;g. carbon vacancies, unexplored. Here, we investigate the photochemical reaction applied on graphene with varying average distances of lattice defects and statistically analyze the characteristic Raman modes which develop with the iodination reaction. We show that the iodination reaction does not lead to Raman&#8208;active defects and thus, the newly formed trans&#8208;oligoene substructures do not contribute to the D&#8208;mode of graphene. A statistical analysis reveals the correlation between the average distance of lattice defects and the intensity of the v1&#8208;mode. For defective graphene with average defect distances below ~1&#8197;nm no new Raman modes evolve, which is the lower limit of the substructure size probed at 532&#8197;nm and explains why this observation was not possible before using common graphene oxide as graphene source.

We have established a convenient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides, which exhibit the characteristic optical properties reflecting the electronic effects of the &#946; nitrogen atom. The ortho&#8208;hydroxyphenyl derivative underwent ESIPT in solution to emit considerably Stokes&#8208;shifted fluorescence in the range of 600&#8211;800&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Inclusion of a heteroatom to the phosphole ring is a promising strategy to intrinsically modulate the optical properties of phosphole derivatives. We report on a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides that were efficiently prepared via sequential C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling, dehydrative [3+2] cycloaddition, and ring&#8208;oxidation reactions. The inclusion of one nitrogen atom into the benzophosphole framework caused red shifting of the absorption and emission maxima, reflecting the greater stabilization of the LUMO level. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzazaphosphole oxide underwent excited state intramolecular proton transfer and emitted a weak fluorescence from the excited state of the N&#8722;H tautomer.

         <title>Selective Transition Enhancement in a g&#8208;Engineered Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diradical formed by functionalizing the yttrium(III)&#8208;phthalocyaninato radical with a nitroxide radical, is characterized by an engineered g&#8208;tensor asymmetry and a weak exchange coupling. Interestingly, its behavior is reminiscent of a spin qutrit, exhibiting two EPR transitions characterized by different Rabi frequencies and whose amplitudes can be selectively enhanced by proper choice of microwave power or magnetic field.







Abstract
A diradical with engineered g&#8208;asymmetry was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#8901; radical platform. Various spectroscopic techniques and computational studies revealed that the electronic structures of the two spin systems remained minimally affected within the diradical system. Fluid&#8208;solution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments revealed a weak exchange coupling with |J| ~ 0.014&#8197;cm&#8722;1, subsequently rationalized by CAS&#8208;SCF calculations. Frozen solution continuous&#8208;wave (CW) EPR experiments showed a complicated and power&#8208;dependent spectrum that eluded analysis using the point&#8208;dipole model. Pulse EPR manipulations with varying microwave powers, or under varying magnetic fields, demonstrated that different resonances could be selectively enhanced or suppressed, based on their different tipping angles. In particular, Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra revealed absorptions of MW power&#8208;dependent intensities, while Field&#8208;Swept Spin Nutation (FSSN) experiments revealed two distinct Rabi frequencies. This study introduces a methodology to synthesize and characterize g&#8208;asymmetric two&#8208;spin systems, of interest in the implementation of spin&#8208;based CNOT gates.

         <title>Unrevealing the Nitrogen Elusive Chirality of 3&#8208;Sulfanyl and 3&#8208;Sulfinyl N&#8208;Tosyl Isoindolinones by ECD Spectra: An Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality of sp2 nitrogen atoms in organic compounds is a somewhat unexpected and subtle effect already detected in the crystal state. However, revealing this effect in solution is rather challenging. A theoretical&#8208;computational study, supported by electronic circular dichroism spectra has captured such an elusive feature. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Palombi, M. Aschi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400232).

         <dc:description>
A tight&#8208;bite bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) is involved in two distinct reactions. The first reaction, featuring the organic aniline p&#8208;toluidine, forms cyclodisilazane through the oxidative addition of both N&#8722;H bonds across two SiII atoms. Conversely, reaction with Fe(CO)5 yields a four&#8208;membered NSi2Fe2 ring featuring a Fe&#8722;Fe bond length of 2.6892(13)&#8197;&#197;. This investigation sheds light on the diverse reactivity of bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) compounds, providing valuable insights into their potential applications in main&#8208;group chemistry.

A series of cobalt polynitrides has been discovered by using laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells under high pressure that demonstrate an increasing degree of nitrogen polymerization with increasing pressure. Synthesis under high pressure and high temperature, coupled with single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;Raman imaging spectroscopy, offers significant advantages in elucidating the crystal structures of these nitrides along with the prospect of recovering of these materials under ambient conditions.

         <title>Chiral Induction in a Self&#8208;Assembled Pd4 Coordination Cage with Chiral Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic interplay of coordination bonds within metal&#8208;organic cages offers a unique avenue for structural evolution in response to external stimuli, presenting a promising strategy for the construction of chiral assemblies. This adaptability is crucial for the selective synthesis of homochiral assemblies and advancement of asymmetric catalysis. In this study, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral square&#8208;planar Pd(II) acceptor with a C2&#8208;symmetric tetrapyridyl donor resulted in the formation of a racemic mixture of the chiral octahedral cage Pd4L2. The existence of this racemic mixture was confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We encoded chiral information into the asymmetric cavity of the cage by encapsulating chiral aromatic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media. The inclusion of a chiral guest induces a preference for one enantiomeric conformation of the cage over the other, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards a single, enantiopure host&#8208;guest complex. While the concept of chiral guest recognition by a chiral host is well&#8208;established, this work constitutes a remarkable example of guest&#8208;mediated chirality transfer leading to the formation of a single enantiopure coordination complex from achiral building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;containing azamacrocycles from chiral triazolopeptoids: synthesis and solid&#8208;state studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new chiral 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic oligoamides (i.e.: triazolopeptoid 4 and 5) were obtained through solid&#8208;phase synthesis of linear precursors followed by high dilution macrocyclization reaction. Theoretical (DFT) and spectroscopic (NMR) studies revealed the intricate interplay between the Na&#8208;chiral side chains and their conformational attitudes. BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of the tertiary amide groups of known 1&#8208;3 and newly synthesized 4 gave novel azamacrocycles 6&#8208;9. Detection of borane complexes of azamacrocycles 6 and 9 (i.e.: 10 and 11), corroborated by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, demonstrated the peculiar properties of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrorings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cu/MnOx Composite with Copper&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Oxygen Vacancies as a Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are anticipated to be the next generation of important energy storage devices to replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the ongoing use of lithium resources and the safety hazards associated with organic electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Manganese&#8208;based compounds, including MnOx materials, have prominent places among the many zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Additionally, Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material's internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4 mAh g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Therefore, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) Amphiphilicity Tunes the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer of Pyrenol&#8208;based Polyphotoacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of light to change the properties of light&#8208;responsive polymers opens avenues for targeted release of cargo with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. Recently, we established photoacid polymers as light&#8208;switchable macromolecular amphiphiles. In these systems, light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) causes changes in amphilicity. However, as the intermolecular process itself critically depends on the local environment of the photoacid unit within the polymer, the overall amphiphilicity directly influences ESPT. Thus, understanding the impact of the local environment on the photophysics of photoacidic side chains is key to material design. In this contribution we address both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of ESPT in oxazoline&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers with pyrenol&#8208;based photoacid side chains. We will compare the effect of polymer design, i.e. statistical and block arrangements, i.e. in poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;(6/8&#8208;hydroxyperene)sulphonylaziridine)] and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;block&#8208;poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(2&#8208;(3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxypyrene)sulphona mide)propyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), on the intermolecular proton transfer reaction by combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. ESPT appears more prominent in the statistical copolymer compared to a block copolymer with overall similar pyrenol loading. We hypothesize that the difference is due to different local chain arrangements adopted by the polymers in the two cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Uptake and Release of Semiochemicals in Channel&#8208;type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Pore Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semiochemicals can be used to manipulate insect behaviour for sustainable pest management strategies, but their high volatility is a major issue for their practical implementation. Inclusion of these molecules within porous materials is a potential solution to this issue, as it can allow for a slower and more controlled release. In this work, we demonstrate that a series of Zr(IV) and Al(III) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with channel&#8208;type pores enable controlled release of three semiochemicals over 100 days by pore size design, with the uptake and rate of release highly dependent on the pore size. Insight from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations indicates that this is due to weaker MOF&#8208;guest interactions per guest molecule as the pore size increases. These MOFs are all stable post&#8208;release and can be reloaded to show near&#8208;identical re&#8208;release profiles. These results provide valuable insight on the diffusion behaviour of volatile guests in MOFs, and for the further development of porous materials for sustainable agriculture applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Cross&#8722;Metathesis with 2,5&#8722;Dimethyl&#8722;2,4&#8722;Hexadiene Enables Isobutylenyl / Prenyl Functionalizations and Rubber Valorization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,5&#8722;Dimethyl&#8722;2,4&#8722;hexadiene is a readily available and easily managable compound, whose symmetric and polymethylated dienic structure should be prone to engage in cross&#8722;metathesis reactions with other alkenes, but this has not been apparently exploited so far. Here we show that this reactant enables the easy synthesis of tri&#8722; and tetra&#8722;susbtituted alkenes (i.e. isobutylenyl and prenyl groups) from simple alkenes under mild reaction conditions, not only with the conventional 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst but also with other Grela&#8722;type catalysts such as StickyCat,TM AquaMetTM and GreenCat.TM The use of liquid and low volatile 2,5&#8722;dimethyl&#8722;2,4&#8722;hexadiene avoids the use of gaseous alkene reactants and, besides, showcases the reactivity of polyisoprene (rubber), thus allowing to optimize the reaction conditions for rubber upcycling, after metathesis reaction of the pristine or used polymer with simple alkenes. These results bring low volatile isoprene&#8722;type compounds as privileged poly&#8722;substituted reactants for alkene cross&#8722;metathesis reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Control Over Nitric Oxide Photorelease via a Molecular Keypad Lock</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on Boolean logic, molecular keypad locks secure molecular information, typically with an optical output. Here we investigate a rare example of a molecular keypad lock with a chemical output. To this end, the light&#8208;activated release of biologically important nitric oxide from a ruthenium complex is studied, using proton concentration and photon flux as inputs. In a pH&#8208;dependent equilibrium, a nitritoruthenium(II) complex is turned into a nitrosylruthenium(II) complex, which releases nitric oxide under irradiation with visible light. The precise prediction of the output nitric oxide concentration as function of the pH and photon flux is achieved with an artificial intelligence approach, namely the adaptive neuro&#8208;fuzzy inference system. In this manner an exceptionally high level of control over the output concentration is obtained. Moreover, the provided concept to lock a chemical output as well as the output prediction may be applied to other (photo)release schemes.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism of a Chiral Triplet Nitrene Investigated under Matrix&#8208;Isolation Conditions in para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>VCD spectra of chiral high&#8208;spin organic radicals are expected to show a strong intensity enhancement and are thought to be difficult to predict using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical methods. Herein we show that the chiral triplet nitrene obtained from photochemical cleavage of N2 from enantiopure 2&#8208;azido&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorenol does not feature extraordinarily strong intensities and that the experimental spectra match nicely with calculated ones. Thereby, this study demonstrates the general feasibility of studies on chiral high&#8208;spin organics by MI&#8208;VCD.</dc:description>

         <title>New architecture based on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and spin crossover complexes to detect volatile organic compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the encapsulation of a spin crossover complex C1 [FeII(L)] (L: 4&#8208;amino&#8208;, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylmethylene)hydrazide) inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows solvatochromism under Volatile Organic compounds (VOCs) sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex. More specifically, this compound shows an interesting reversible color change under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption and can therefore be considered as a new kind of optical VOCs chemosensor, opening new doors for developing a broad range of VOCs optical sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Unspecific Peroxygenase (UPO) can be Tuned for Oxygenation or Halogenation Activity by Controlling the Reaction pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unspecific Peroxygenases (UPOs) are increasingly significant enzymes for selective oxygenations as they are stable, highly active and catalyze their reactions at the expense of only hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Their structural similarity to chloroperoxidase (CPO) means that UPOs can also catalyze halogenation reactions based upon the generation of hypohalous acids from halide and H2O2. Here we show that the halogenation and oxygenation modes of a UPO can be stimulated at different pH values. Using simple aromatic compounds such as thymol, we show that, at a pH of 3.0 and 6.0, either brominated or oxygenated products respectively are produced. Preparative 100 mg scale transformations of substrates were performed with 60&#8211;72% isolated yields of brominated products obtained. A one&#8208;pot bromination&#8208;oxygenation cascade reaction on 4&#8208;ethylanisole, in which the pH was adjusted from 3.0 to 6.0 at the halfway stage, yielded sequentially brominated and oxygenated products 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethyl alcohol and 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy acetophenone with 82% combined conversion. These results identify UPOs as an unusual example of a biocatalyst that is tunable for entirely different chemical reactions, dependent upon the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Alcohols to &#946;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Vinylsulfones by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral secondary alcohols, serving as essential structural motifs, hold significant potential for diverse applications. The exploration of effective synthetic strategies toward these compounds is both attractive and challenging. Herein, we present an asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael reaction involving aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles and &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl vinylsulfones catalyzed by bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS), achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 98% ee). Additionally, a sequential process including asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael and debenzylation, facilitated by BPS/Lewis acid cooperation, was revealed for synthesizing diverse chiral secondary alcohol compounds in high yields (81&#8208;88%) with consistent stereoselectivities. Furthermore, mechanistic explorations and subsequent results unveiled that the enantioselectivity originates from hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair interactions between the BPS catalyst and the substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Fusion Elevates the Electronic Mobility of Azabenzannulated Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The backwardness of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors still exists compared with the p&#8208;type counterparts. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is of great importance for organic electronic devices and their integrated circuits. In recent years, azabenzannulated perylene diimide (PDI), as one of immense bay&#8208;region&#8208;annulated PDI derivatives, has drawn considerable attentions. However, the electronic mobilities of azabenzannulated PDI derivatives are barely satisfactory. In this contribution, the peripheral benzene ring in azabenzannulated PDI 2 was fused to the ortho position by intermolecular C&#8722;H arylation cyclization. This endows the resultant azabenzannulated PDI 4 a planar configuration as well as electron deficient pentagonal ring. As a result, the electronic mobility of 4 is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the nonfused azabenzannulated PDI 2. This work shall pave a new avenue in elevating the performance of azabenzannulated PDI in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>RuPHOX&#8208;Ru Catalyzed Asymmetric Cascade Hydrogenation of 3&#8208;Substituted Chromones for the Synthesis of Corresponding Chiral Chromanols&#8203;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient RuPHOX&#8208;Ru catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been achieved under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 99% yield, &gt;99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr). Control reactions and deuterium labelling experiments revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution process occurs during the subsequent hydrogenation of the C=O double bond, which is responsible for the high performance of the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation. The resulting products allow for several transformations and it was shown that the protocol provides a practical and alternative strategy for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented Metal&#8208;organic Framework Membranes for Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes, which are recognized as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platforms applied in various separation processes, have attracted widespread attention. Nonetheless, to overcome the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, which is crucial for achieving efficient separation, it is important to rationally design and manipulate MOF membrane structure. Given remarkable advances in the past decade, a timely summary of recent advancement in this field has become indispensable. This review introduces major strategies for fabricating oriented MOF membranes, including in situ growth, contra&#8208;diffusion method, interface&#8208;assisted approach, and laminated nanosheet assembly. New insights into their updated progress and potential are elucidated. Of particular note, recent development and emerging applications of oriented MOF membranes, illustrating their potential to address environmental and energy challenges, are highlighted. Finally, remaining challenges facing their bath production and practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>From Criegee to Breslow: How &#960;&#8208;Donors Steer the Route of Olefin Ozonolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ozonolysis of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins could lead to currently unknown urea O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates. However, our DFT computations predict that strongly polarized double bonds prefer to accept an oxygen atom from ozone rather than undergoing the usually encountered cycloaddition reaction. The product of this reaction is a precursor of the Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
While &#960;&#8208;bonds typically undergo cycloaddition with ozone, resulting in the release of much&#8208;noticed carbonyl O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates, lone&#8208;pairs of electrons tend to selectively accept a single oxygen atom from O3, producing singlet dioxygen. We questioned whether the introduction of potent electron&#8208;donating groups, akin to N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, could influence the reactivity of double bonds &#8211; shifting from cycloaddition to oxygen atom transfer or generating lesser&#8208;known, yet stabilized, donor&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates. Consequently, we conducted a comparative computational study using density functional theory on a series of model olefins with increasing polarity due to (asymmetric) &#960;&#8208;donor substitution. Reaction path computations indicate that highly polarized double bonds, instead of forming primary ozonides in their reaction with O3, exhibit a preference for accepting a single oxygen atom, resulting in a zwitterionic species formally identified as a carbene&#8208;carbonyl adduct. This previously unexplored reactivity potentially introduces aldehyde umpolung chemistry (Breslow intermediate) through olefin ozonolysis. Considering solvent effects implicitly reveals that increased solvent polarity further directs the trajectories toward a single oxygen atom transfer reactivity by stabilizing the zwitterionic character of the transition state. The competing modes of chemical reactivity can be explained by a bifurcation of the reaction valley in the post&#8208;transition state region.

         <title>Advances in the Continuous Flow Synthesis of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;Membered Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This short review summarises key developments for the synthesis of strained 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems exploiting continuous flow synthesis. These important carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic scaffolds are readily accessed via photochemical, electrochemical and temperature sensitive strategies.







Abstract
Small carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic ring systems have experienced a significant increase in importance in recent years due to their relevance in modern pharmaceuticals, as building blocks for designer materials or as synthetic intermediates. This necessitated the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of these strained ring systems focusing on effectiveness and scalability. The high ring strain of these entities as well as the use of high&#8208;energy reagents and intermediates has often challenged their synthesis. Continuous flow approaches have thus emerged as highly effective means to safely and reliably access these strained scaffolds. In this short review, key developments in this field are summarised showcasing the power of continuous flow approaches for accessing 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems via thermal, photo&#8208; and electrochemical processes.

         <title>Formation of Peroxynitrite, [O&#8722;N&#8722;O&#8722;O]&#8722;, via a Cascade of Reactions between Ozonide and Ammonia</title>

         <dc:description>
[ONOO]&#8722; has been encountered along a cascade of reactions between KO3 and ammonia in the presents of a partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based cation. For the first time, high resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite ion have been obtained and single crystals were studied by Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report on an unexpected reaction between ammonia and potassium ozonide dissolved in liq. NH3 resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite, [ONOO]&#8722;, which exclusively happens in the presence of a specific partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based ammonium cation. High&#8208;resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite anion in cis&#8208;conformation have been obtained. We further studied this molecule anion by single crystal Raman spectroscopy. The cis and trans isomers of peroxynitrite were analysed computationally with respect to their relative energies, the cis&#8208;trans transition barrier and their decomposition pathways to the nitrate anion. By experimentally examining cations decorated with fluorine ligands to different degrees, we demonstrate that fluorine specific interactions play a crucial role in the unexpected formation of peroxynitrite and as a conspicuously structure directing factor for the underlying crystalline solid phases, exhibiting distinct micro&#8208;separations of fluorine and hydrogen enriched regions.

The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly.







Abstract
Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial &#963;&#8208;holes as halogen&#8208;bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side&#8208;arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self&#8208;aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod&#8208;like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.

Framework and polymeric nanoreactor have been regarded for improving cascade chemical reaction in the tumor microenvironment. Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzymes have been activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. In this review, we identify the significance of dual&#8208;enzyme cascade in the tumor microenvironment which regulated by ROS activity. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, ROS formation, including cascaded enzymes along with synergistic therapy.







Abstract
Framework and polymeric nanoreactors (NRs) have distinct advantages in improving chemical reaction efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzyme is activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. High levels of H2O2 induce self&#8208;destruction of the vesicles by releasing quinone methide to deplete glutathione and suppress the antioxidant potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoreactors results in efficient tumor ablation via suppressing cancer&#8208;cell metabolism. The main driving force would be to take advantage of the distinct metabolic properties of cancer cells along with the high peroxidase&#8208;like activity of metalloenzyme/metalloprotein. A cascade strategy of dual enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and nitroreductase (NTR) wherein the former acts as an O2&#8208;consuming agent such as overexpression of NTR and further amplified NTR&#8208;catalyzed release for antitumor therapy. The design of cascade bioreductive hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery via GOx regulates NTR upregulation and NTR&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanoclusters in cascaded enzymes along with chemo&#8208;radiotherapy with synergistic therapy are illustrated. Finally, we outline the role of the nanoreactor strategy of cascading enzymes along with self&#8208;synergistic tumor therapy.

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials for Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays an important role in evading tumor immunity and conferring resistance to immunotherapy. Nanomaterials targeting various immune components in the suppressive TIME can alter the tumor inhibition state, promote the therapeutic effect of anti&#8208;tumor drugs, and enhance anti&#8208;tumor efficacy In this review, we provided an overview of key briefly viewed the key components within the suppressive TIME and various nanoparticles designed to target these components for applications in cancer immunotherapy. Through comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of immune cells in sculpting anti&#8208;tumor immunity, next&#8208;generation nanoscale immunotherapies can be rationally designed to orchestrate a pro&#8208;immunogenic tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising results in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle&#8208;based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle&#8208;based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.

         <title>Tunable Optical Anisotropy in Rare&#8208;earth Borates with Flexible [BO3] Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borates have garnered a lot of attention in the realm of solid&#8208;state chemistry due to their remarkable characteristics, in which the synthesis of borates with isolated [BO3] by adding rare&#8208;earth elements is one of the main areas of structural design study. Five new mixed&#8208;metal Y&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth borates, Ba2ZnY2(BO3)4, KNa2Y(BO3)2, Li2CsY4(BO3)5, LiRb2Y(BO3)2, and RbCaY(BO3)2, have been discovered using the high&#8208;temperature solution approach. Isolated [BO3] clusters arranged in various configurations comprise their entire anionic framework, allowing for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081 under 1064 nm. In this study, we characterize the relative placements of their [BO3] groups and examine how their structure affects their characteristics. The origin of their considerable optical anisotropy has been proven theoretically. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates' anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Gaining Insights into the Interplay between Optical and Magnetic Properties in Photoexcited Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe early and recent advances in the fascinating field of combined magnetic and optical properties of inorganic coordination compounds and in particular of 3d&#8208;4f single molecule magnets. We cover various applied techniques which allow for the correlation of results obtained in the frequency and time domain in order to highlight the specific properties of these compounds and the future challenges towards multidimensional spectroscopic tools. An important point is to understand the details of the interplay of magnetic and optical properties through performing time&#8208;resolved studies in the presence of external fields especially magnetic ones. This will enable further exploration of this fundamental interactions i.e. the two components of electromagnetic radiation influencing optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction of C60 with methylammonium lead iodide perovskite surfaces: Unveiling the Role of C60 in Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the interaction between fullerene (C60) and perovskite surfaces is pivotal for advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior of C60 on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations. We explore various surface terminations and defect configurations to elucidate the influence of surface morphology on the C60&#8208;perovskite interaction, computing the adsorption energy and transfer of charge. Our results reveal distinct adsorption energies and charge transfer mechanisms for different surface terminations, shedding light on the role of surface defects in modifying the electronic structure and stability of perovskite materials. Furthermore, we provide insights into the potential of C60 to passivate surface defects, playing a relevant role in the surface reconstruction after the formation of defects. This comprehensive understanding of C60&#8208;perovskite interactions offers valuable guidelines about the role of fullerenes on surface structure and reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Natural light&#8208;responsive rhodopsins play a critical role in visual conversion, signal transduction, energy transmission, etc., which has aroused extensive interest in the past decade. Inspired by these gorgeous works of living beings, scientists have constructed various biomimetic light&#8208;responsive nanochannels to mimic the behaviors of rhodopsins. However, it is still challenging to build stimuli&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannels only regulated by visible light as the rhodopsins are always at the sub&#8208;nanometer level and regulated by visible light. Pillar[6]arenes have an open cavity of 6.7 &#197;, which can selectively recognize small organic molecules. They can be connected to ions of ammonium or carboxylate groups on the rims. Therefore, we designed and synthesized the amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived side chains of pillar[6]arenes with opposite charges. The sub&#8208;nanochannels were constructed through the electrostatic interaction of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived pillar[6]arenes. Then, the natural chromophore of the retinal with visible light&#8208;responsive performance was modified on the upper edge of the sub&#8208;nanochannel to realize the visible light switched on and off. Finally, we successfully constructed a visible light&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannel, providing a novel method for regulating the selective transport of energy&#8208;donating molecules of ATP.</dc:description>

Heterogeneous catalysts not only facilitate synergistic enhancement of distinct catalytic centers compared to their homogeneous counterparts, but also allow for the easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements in developing heterogeneous carriers, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and others, for synergistic catalytic reactions. The advantages of porous materials in heterogeneous catalysis originate from their ability to provide a high surface area, facilitate enhanced mass transport, offer a tunable chemical structure, ensure the stability of active species, and enable easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. Both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into suitable porous carriers to create heterogeneous dual photocatalysts for organic transformations. Notably, experimental evidence from reported cases has shown that the catalytic efficacy of heterogeneous catalysts often surpasses that of their homogeneous analogues. This enhanced performance is attributed to the proximity and confinement effects provided by the porous nature of the carriers. It is expected that porous carriers will provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse catalysts, thus exhibiting superior performance across a range of organic transformations and appealing prospect for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Coordination Chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalytic Sites by Ru Species to Accelerate the Polysulfide Conversion Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is compromised by the loss of sulfur as dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte and consequently the polysulfide redox shutting effect. Accelerating the conversion kinetics of polysulfide intermediates into sulfur or lithium sulfide through electrocatalysis has emerged as a root&#8208;cause solution. Co&#8208;N&#8208;C composite electrocatalyst is commonly used for this purpose. It is illustrated here that how the effectiveness can be improved by modulating the coordination chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalytic sites through introducing Ru species (RuCo&#8208;NC). The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8208;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8208;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Using Ru to modulate the electronic structure in the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C configuration and the additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8208;Nx species can manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with RuCo&#8208;NC can reduce the capacity fade rate from 0.11% per cycle without catalyst (initial capacity of 701 mAh g&#8208;1) to 0.054% per cycle (initial capacity of 1074 mAh g&#8208;1) over 400 cycles at 0.2 C rate. The results of this study provide the evidence for a feasible catalyst modification strategy for the polysulfide electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Syntheses of (partially) aromatic nitrogen heterocycles increasingly rely on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8211;C&#8208; and C&#8211;N&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here we describe a different approach to the synthesis of indolines by a domino C(sp3)&#8211;H activation, 1,2&#8208;addition, and defluorinative SNAr&#8208;cyclization sequence to provide the target 1,2&#8208;diarylindolines (1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) from ortho&#8208;fluorinated methyl&#8208;arenes and N&#8208;aryl imines (benzylidene anilines) in a cyclocondensation that is mediated by potassium hexa&#173;methyl&#173;di&#173;silazide (KHMDS) as base exclusively. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process via C&#8211;H and C&#8211;F bond activation provides a one&#8208;step entry into a wide array of indoline scaffolds (43 examples, up to 96% yield). This privileged substructure is common in natural products and pharmaceuticals alike, and cannot be accessed by traditional condensation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Single Acyclic Phosphonate Nucleotide (ZNA) Modifications on DNA Duplex Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An acyclic phosphonate&#8208;linked nucleic acid backbone (ZNA) demonstrated the capability to support duplex formation and propagate genetic information in vivo, unveiling its potential for evolution into a synthetic genetic system (XNA). To determine the structural impact of such modification, modified Dickerson Drew DNA dodecamers (DDDs) were prepared by solid phase synthesis, each containing either an (R) or (S) isomeric form of a cytosine ZNA nucleotide. While the DDD is known to adopt a stable duplex, both duplex and hairpin forms were simultaneously observed for both modified oligonucleotides by NMR spectroscopy over a broad temperature range (5&#8211;65 &#176;C). Diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments allowed to separate duplex and hairpin signals based on the different diffusion constants of both conformational states. For the oligomer containing (R)&#8208;ZNA, only the duplex form occurred at 5 &#176;C, while it was not possible to determine by NMR a single hairpin conformation at higher temperatures. In the case of the (S)&#8208;ZNA nucleoside modified oligomer, both hairpin and duplex forms were observable at 0 &#176;C, while a single hairpin conformation was detected at 37 &#176;C, suggesting a higher destabilizing effect on dsDNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Sites of the C&#8208;type Lectin&#8208;Like Fold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

C&#8208;type lectins, a large superfamily of proteins, are crucial in immunity and homeostasis. Their C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain enables them to bind a wide range of ligands, including those not dependent on Ca2+ interactions. This adaptability is further enhanced by their variable domain architecture and conformational plasticity. Secondary binding sites, often located away from the primary site, contribute to the C&#8208;type lectin functional diversity by accommodating different ligands, thus offering potential for drug discovery by fine&#8208;tuning biological responses and increasing selectivity.







Abstract
C&#8208;type lectins are a large superfamily of proteins involved in a multitude of biological processes. In particular, their involvement in immunity and homeostasis has rendered them attractive targets for diverse therapeutic interventions. They share a characteristic C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain whose adaptability enables them to bind a broad spectrum of ligands beyond the originally defined canonical Ca2+&#8208;dependent carbohydrate binding. Together with variable domain architecture and high&#8208;level conformational plasticity, this enables C&#8208;type lectins to meet diverse functional demands. Secondary sites provide another layer of regulation and are often intricately linked to functional diversity. Located remote from the canonical primary binding site, secondary sites can accommodate ligands with other physicochemical properties and alter protein dynamics, thus enhancing selectivity and enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the biological response. In this review, we outline the structural determinants allowing C&#8208;type lectins to perform a large variety of tasks and to accommodate the ligands associated with it. Using the six well&#8208;characterized Ca2+&#8208;dependent and Ca2+&#8208;independent C&#8208;type lectin receptors DC&#8208;SIGN, langerin, MGL, dectin&#8208;1, CLEC&#8208;2 and NKG2D as examples, we focus on the characteristics of non&#8208;canonical interactions and secondary sites and their potential use in drug discovery endeavors.

         <title>Design of Bright Chemogenetic Reporters Based on the Combined Engineering of Fluorogenic Molecular Rotors and of the HaloTag Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bright chemogenetic reporters based on the HaloTag technology with green to red emission range were obtained by combining the molecular engineering of chemically&#8208;accessible fluorescent molecular rotors with mutations of the HaloTag protein. The reporters are suitable for wash&#8208;free live cell imaging with good contrast and the design strategy facilitates the future diversification and optimization of the properties.







Abstract
The combination of fluorogenic probes (fluorogens) and self&#8208;labeling protein tags represent a promising tool for imaging biological processes with high specificity but it requires the adequation between the fluorogen and its target to ensure a good activation of its fluorescence. In this work, we report a strategy to develop molecular rotors that specifically target HaloTag with a strong enhancement of their fluorescence. The divergent design facilitates the diversification of the structures to tune the photophysical and cellular properties. Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash&#8208;free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.

         <title>Metal Free Functionalization of Saturated Heterocycles with Vinylarenes and Pyridine Enabled by Photocatalytic Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylarenes as synthetic linchpins towards the pyridine and 3D fragments conjugation enabled by metal free photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is described, which exhibit broad substrate scope, mild conditions, and excellent regioselectivity. This reaction tolerates late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules.







Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are important class of structural scaffolds in small&#8208;molecule drugs, natural products, and synthetic intermediates. Here, we disclosed a metal free, mild, and scalable functionalization of saturated heterocycles using vinylarenes as a linchpin approach. Key to success of this transformation is the employing of simple and cheap benzophenone as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst. This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions. The potential pharmaceutical utility of the procedure has also been demonstrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules. Initial mechanism studies and control experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions

         <title>Heptagonal Molecular Tiling via Self&#8208;Assembly of Heptagonal Phenylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling has been demonstrated at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface by the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring long alkoxy substituents. The heptagonal molecules align in an antiparallel pattern, which resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of the heptagonal cores.







Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level scrutinization of on&#8208;surface tiling garners considerable interest among scientists. Herein, we demonstrate molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling using the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring 14 long alkoxy substituents at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface using scanning tunneling microscopy. This heptagonal macrocycle produces an antiparallel pattern at the 1&#8208;phenyloctane&#8211;graphite interface through van der Waals interactions between the alkoxy chains. This pattern resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of heptagonal cores owing to intermolecular interactions between the alkoxy chains. Conversely, at the 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene&#8211;graphite interface, the heptagonal molecule forms an oblique pattern composed of four independent molecular orientations. This phenomenon arises from core distortion induced by the coadsorption of the solvent molecules within the intrinsic macrocyclic pores. This study elucidates the design strategy &#8211; specifically, the choice of heptagonal molecular building block &#8211; for heptagonal tiling and fills a crucial gap in the field of two&#8208;dimensional crystal engineering.

         <title>Perfluoroalkylation of Triarylamines by EDA Complexes and Ulterior Sensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;Electrocyclization to Perfluoroalkylated endo&#8208;Carbazoles. Mechanistic and Photophysical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkylation reactions of triarylamines with perfluoroalkyl iodides by visible&#8208;light irradiation of EDA complexes have been achieved. When these perfluoroalkylated triarylamines are subjected to acetone&#8208;sensitized irradiation, a highly stereospecific electrocyclization to endo perfluoroalkylated carbazoles is obtained. Mechanistic and photophysical insights are studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;M. Bonesi, A. Postigo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400905).

         <title>Directed Evolution and Immobilization of Lactobacillus brevis Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Rivastigmine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To produce the key chiral intermediate of Rivastigmine, directed evolution was employed to enhance the specific activity of an alcohol dehydrogenase by over 100&#8208;fold under optimal conditions. Co&#8208;immobilization of this alcohol dehydrogenase with glucose dehydrogenase on magnetic nanoparticles yields easily recyclable biocatalysts. The biocatalytic reduction was combined with further chemical steps to achieve the chemoenzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%, demonstrating the synthesis of this important drug in an environmentally friendly and inexpensive manner.







Abstract
Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi&#8208;rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co&#8208;immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%. This study offers an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Amino Acid Derivative Coordination Compounds: Novel Contrast Agent and Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of multidimensional coordination compounds have been synthesized based on glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Magnetic resonance imaging studies and chiroptical properties have been explored.







Abstract
In this work a family of multidimensional (2&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethyl) amino acid coordination compounds have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized. For this purpose, glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine have been selected as starting amino acids and Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ as metallic nodes. From one side, for Mn2+ based dimer magnetic resonance imaging studies have been conducted, prompted by the number and disposition of the coordinated water molecules and taking into consideration the promising future of manganese&#8208;based coordination compounds as bio&#8208;compatible substitutes to conventional Gd based contrast agents. From another side, d10 block metal&#8208;based complexes allowed exploring photoluminescence properties derived by in&#8197;situ synthesized ligands. Finally, amino acid preserved structural chirality allowed us to examine chiroptical properties, particularly focusing on circularly polarized luminescence.

Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) have significant promise as chemical sensors for the differentiation of chiral analytes due to their highly tuneable nature. This review discusses the spectroscopic methods used for chiroptical sensing including photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance. Future directions are highlighted with a view towards the incorporation of CMOFs into chemical sensor devices.







Abstract
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) are a rapidly growing field reflecting their potential as selective and sensitive chemical sensors for chiral analytes. The highly tuneable nature of CMOFs enables the size, shape, and non&#8208;covalent interactions to be optimised towards specific analytes to engender strong intermolecular interactions and sensing responses. While CMOFs as chiral chemical sensor devices have been explored with electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), bipolar and chemiresistive sensing techniques, the CMOFs as chiral chemical sensors using spectroscopic methods has received significantly less attention. This review examines the synthesis of CMOFs for chemical sensors with spectroscopic methods such as photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance with a view towards their incorporation into chemical sensor devices. Future directions of the field are highlighted for the generation of functional devices.

         <title>An Enantioselective Aminocatalytic Cascade Reaction Affording Bioactive Hexahydroazulene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalysis opens up for a novel cascade reaction concept where 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines first undergo an enantioselective [6+4] cycloaddition with trienamines, followed by a spontaneously series of reactions to provide chiral hexahydraoazulenes, of which some show bioactivity.







Abstract
A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8722;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), up to 96&#8201;% ee, and yields up to 52&#8201;%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and (Photo)Catalytic Behavior of Ce&#8208;MOFs Containing Perfluoroalkylcarboxylate Linkers: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>

Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer potential for photodegradation of organic dyes in new perfluorinated Ce&#8208;MOFs.







Abstract
Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure. We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8211;3.1&#8197;eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.

         <title>Construction of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) Solid Solutions for Improving Solar Fuels Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by H2O Vapour</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a molten&#8208;salt approach to synthesize Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) solid solutions. Expand the light&#8208;harvesting wavelength range. Additionally, we found that with the introduction of ZnFe2O4, the photogenerated electrons transition from CoO4 tetrahedron to FeO6 octahedron, and the FeO6 octahedron becomes the photocatalytic reduction site. The introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Indenoannulated Tridecacyclene: An All&#8208;Carbon Seven&#8208;Stage Redox&#8208;Amphoter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenoannulated tridecacyclene, an unprecedented saddle&#8208;shaped non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon, has been synthesized. Under electrochemical conditions, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid subunits in the charged states. Chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the corresponding dication and dianion, which were comprehensively characterized both in experiment and theory.







Abstract
We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization

In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non-benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
