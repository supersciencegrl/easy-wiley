         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Foldamers with Axial Chirality: Chiroptical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the construction of chiral foldamers and their chiroptical properties. Fabrication, properties and application of the rotatable folded systems with respect to the generation of axial chirality, the regulation of folding behavior and the evolution of chiroptical properties are illustrated. Furthermore, the applications of chiral foldamers in optical chirality sensing and asymmetric synthesis are briefly introduced.







Abstract
Folding phenomenon refers to the formation of a specific conformation widely featured by the intramolecular interactions, which broadly exist in biomacromolecules, and are closely related to their structures and functions. A variety of oligomeric folded molecules have been designed and synthesized, namely &#8220;foldamer&#8221;, exhibiting potentials in pharmaceutical and catalysis. Molecular folding is a promising strategy to transfer chirality from substituents to the whole skeleton, when chirality transfer, amplification, evolution, and other behaviors could be achieved. Investigating chirality using foldamer model deepens the understanding of the structure&#8208;function correlation in biomacromolecules and expands the molecular toolbox towards chiroptical and asymmetrical chemistry. Substitutes with abundant hydrogen bonding sites conjugated to a rotatable aryl group afford a parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like conformation, which enables the emergence and manipulation of axial chirality. This concept aims to give a brief introduction and summary of the hydrogen bonded foldamers with anchored axial chirality, by taking some recent cases as examples. Design principles, control over axial chirality and applications are also reviewed.

         <title>A Hydride&#8208;Substituted Homoleptic Silylborate: How Similar is it to its Diborane(6)&#8208;Dianion Isostere?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;dihydride&#8208;substituted silylborate was synthesized via an &#8220;Umpolung&#8221; approach using a chlorosilane and a boron&#8208;centered nucleophile. Except for the B&#8722;Si vs. B&#8722;B cores, the silylborate is identical to a prominent diborane(6) dianion, allowing a direct comparison of their reactivities after H&#8722; abstraction. The resulting B(&#956;&#8208;H)E product is isolable for E=B, but constitutes a (still synthetically useful) transient intermediate for E=Si.







Abstract
The B&#8208;nucleophilic 9H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene dianion reacts with 9&#8208;chloro&#8208;9&#8208;silafluorene to afford air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable silylborate salts M[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2] (M[HBSiH], M=Li, Na). Li[HBSiH] and Me3SiCl give the B&#8722;pyridine adduct Ar2(py)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2 ((py)BSiH) or the chlorosilane Li[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(Cl)Ar2] (Li[HBSiCl]) in C6H6&#8208;pyridine or THF. In both cases, the first step is H&#8722; abstraction at the B center. The resulting free borane subsequently binds a py or thf ligand. While the py adduct is stable at room temperature, the thf adduct undergoes a 1,2&#8208;H shift via the cyclic B(&#956;&#8208;H)Si intermediate BHSi, which is afterwards attacked at the Si atom by a Cl&#8722; ion to give Li[HBSiCl]. DFT calculations were employed to support the proposed reaction mechanism and to characterize the electronic structure of BHSi. Treatment of Li[HBSiCl] with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IMe introduces the neutral donor at the Si atom and leads to Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(IMe)Ar2 (HBSi(IMe)), a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;stabilized silylene.

Except for the B&#8722;Si vs. B&#8722;B cores, the silylborate is identical to a prominent diborane(6) dianion, allowing a direct comparison of their reactivities after H&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; abstraction.

Li[&lt;b&gt;HBSiH&lt;/b&gt;] and Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl give the B&#8722;pyridine adduct Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;(py)BSiH&lt;/b&gt;) or the chlorosilane Li[Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H)B&#8722;Si(Cl)Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (Li[&lt;b&gt;HBSiCl&lt;/b&gt;]) in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-pyridine or THF.

         <title>Optimization of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)</title>

Ready to screen. A library of cationic bis(acylhydrazones) as putative G4&#8208;DNA ligands was prepared by a straightforward condensation of the corresponding building blocks. Screening the resulting samples (without any isolation or purification steps) by fluorescence&#8208;melting experiments identified three novel hits, whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNA targets were studied in detail by several biophysical methods and molecular modeling.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine&#8208;rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high&#8208;throughput methods that allow the generation of congeneric series of G4&#8208;targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigating their interactions with the targets. We have developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well&#8208;established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables the rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNAs of different topologies were studied in detail by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.

         <title>Interfacial C&#8722;S Bonds of g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
</title>

The effective construction of interfacial C&#8722;S bond and built&#8208;in electric field in g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterojunction improves the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting excellent CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of a S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized the g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8197;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10&#8201;%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic activity.

The built-in electric field at the interface of a S-scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized the g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; S-scheme heterostructure through in&#8197;situ deposition of Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; (BBS) on porous g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (P-CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built-in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction performance of 10&#8201;%Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (BBS/P-CN) reaches 32.78&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P-CN, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P-CN and BBS. The S-scheme charge-transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge-transfer and catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dithiolopyrrolones are Prochelators that are Activated by Glutathione</title>

Natural prochelators: Dithiolopyrrolones are promising antibiotics. They are reduced by glutathione after cell entry. The activated dithiol chelates essential metal ions in cells. We also report an expedient synthesis for natural derivatives.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs), such as holomycin, are natural products that hold promise as scaffolds for antibiotics as they exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. They consist of a unique bicyclic core containing a disulfide that is crucial for their biological activity. Herein, we establish the DTPs as prochelators. We show that the disulfides are reduced at cellular gluathione levels. This activates the drugs and initiates interactions with targets, particularly metal coordination. In addition, we report an expedient synthesis for the DTPs thiolutin and aureothricin, providing facile access to important natural DTPs and derivatives thereof.

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Gb3 Enriched Lipid Domains: Impact of Isomerization on Gb3&#8208;Shiga Toxin B Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it on: Gb3 sphingolipids with azobenzene groups serve as light&#8208;triggered nano&#8208;tools to control lipid and protein domains. By using the ability of Gb3 to bind Shiga toxin, its photo&#8208;isomerization alters the protein distribution on liquid&#8208;ordered domains and induces submicrometer&#8208;sized protein lakes. This may offer new strategies for controlling the structure of biological membranes including membrane&#8208;interacting proteins.







Abstract
The plasma membrane is a complex assembly of proteins and lipids that can self&#8208;assemble in submicroscopic domains commonly termed &#8220;lipid rafts&#8221;, which are implicated in membrane signaling and trafficking. Recently, photo&#8208;sensitive lipids were introduced to study membrane domain organization, and photo&#8208;isomerization was shown to trigger the mixing and de&#8208;mixing of liquid&#8208;ordered (lo) domains in artificial phase&#8208;separated membranes. Here, we synthesized globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) glycosphingolipids that harbor an azobenzene moiety at different positions of the fatty acid to investigate light&#8208;induced membrane domain reorganization, and that serve as specific receptors for the protein Shiga toxin (STx). Using phase&#8208;separated supported lipid bilayers on mica surfaces doped with four different photo&#8208;Gb3 molecules, we found by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy that liquid disordered (ld) domains were formed within lo domains upon trans&#8208;cis photo&#8208;isomerization. The fraction and size of these ld domains were largest for Gb3 molecules with the azobenzene group at the end of the fatty acid. We further investigated the impact of domain reorganization on the interaction of the B&#8208;subunits of STx with the photo&#8208;Gb3. Fluorescence and atomic force micrographs clearly demonstrated that STxB binds to the lo phase if Gb3 is in the trans&#8208;configuration, whereas two STxB populations are formed if the photo&#8208;Gb3 is switched to the cis&#8208;configuration highlighting the idea of manipulating lipid&#8208;protein interactions with a light stimulus.

         <title>The HD Reaction of Nitrogenase: a Detailed Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism is presented for the reaction D +2H++2e&#8722;&#8594;2HD of the enzyme nitrogenase, developed with density functional simulations of a 486&#8208;atom model of the active site FeMo&#8208;co and surrounding protein. It explains the accumulated experimental data and connects with the enigmatic N2&#8594;NH3 reaction of the enzyme.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the enzyme that converts N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions. The chemical mechanism of this catalysis at the active site FeMo&#8208;co [Fe7S9CMo(homocitrate)] is unknown. An obligatory co&#8208;product is H2, while exogenous H2 is a competitive inhibitor. Isotopic substitution using exogenous D2 revealed the N2&#8208;dependent reaction D2+2H++2e&#8722;&#8594;2HD (the &#8216;HD reaction&#8217;), together with a collection of additional experimental characteristics and requirements. This paper describes a detailed mechanism for the HD reaction, developed and elaborated using density functional simulations with a 486&#8208;atom model of the active site and surrounding protein. First D2 binds at one Fe atom (endo&#8208;Fe6 coordination position), where it is flanked by H&#8722;Fe6 (exo position) and H&#8722;Fe2 (endo position). Then there is synchronous transfer of these two H atoms to bound D2, forming one HD bound to Fe2 and a second HD bound to Fe6. These two HD dissociate sequentially. The final phase is recovery of the two flanking H atoms. These H atoms are generated, sequentially, by translocation of a proton from the protein surface to S3B of FeMo&#8208;co and combination with introduced electrons. The first H atom migrates from S3B to exo&#8208;Fe6 and the second from S3B to endo&#8208;Fe2. Reaction energies and kinetic barriers are reported for all steps. This mechanism accounts for the experimental data: (a)&#8197;stoichiometry; (b)&#8197;the N2&#8208;dependence results from promotional N2 bound at exo&#8208;Fe2; (c)&#8197;different N2 binding Km for the HD reaction and the NH3 formation reaction results from involvement of two different sites; (d)&#8197;inhibition by CO; (e)&#8197;the non&#8208;occurrence of 2HD&#8594;H2+D2 results from the synchronicity of the two transfers of H to D2; (f)&#8197;inhibition of HD production at high pN2 is by competitive binding of N2 at endo&#8208;Fe6; (g)&#8197;the non&#8208;leakage of D to solvent follows from the hydrophobic environment and irreversibility of proton introduction.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Functional Groups Induced Tuning MOFs&#8217; 2D into 1D Pore Channels for Pipeline Natural Gas Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the ligand functionalized by the NH2 group or Cl atom, the 2D &#8220;zigzag&#8221; pore channel of a new pillar&#8208;layer tfz&#8208;d&#8208;MOF based upon the [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(COO)6(NC5H4)4] cluster was finely tuned to be the 2D &#8220;straight&#8221; one or the 1D &#8220;straight&#8221; one, respectively. Experiments and simulations of three isostructural MOFs further revealed that the selective C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 adsorptions were apparently improved because of their structural changes of pore channels. For the first time, tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs with strengthened host&#8211;guest interactions in the gas adsorption and separation was demonstrated by our work.







Abstract
The solvothermal reactions of CoCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, 3,5&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (H2L) and isonicotinic acid (HL1)/3&#8208;amino isonicotinic acid (HL2)/3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid (HL3) successfully led to three tfz&#8208;d topological pillar&#8208;layer [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(COO)6(NC5H4)4] cluster&#8208;based MOFs, namely, [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L1)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMA]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai76, SNNU&#8208;Bai=Shaanxi Normal University Bai's group), [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L2)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai77) and [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai78). With the 2D pore channels in SNNU&#8208;Bai76 and SNNU&#8208;Bai77 being tuned to the 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78, C3H8 and C2H6 adsorption uptakes are apparently improved and the IAST selectivities of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 almost remain, which indicate that SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may be one potential separation material for the pipeline natural gas purification. These were further confirmed by the breakthrough experiments for the simulated pipeline natural gas (C3H8/C2H6/CH4&#8201;:&#8201;5/10/85 gas mixture) of three isostructural MOFs. Furthermore, GCMC simulations revealed that due to one of the pore channels blocked by Cl atoms in a couple of 3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid with the changed conformation as the pillar, the pore wall of the formed 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may interact with the adsorbed C3H8 or C2H6 molecule more strongly, for which more atoms of framework at the new adsorption site will interact with the adsorbed gas molecule by more intermolecular interactions. This was also evidenced by the increased binding energies, being consistent with the tuning of adsorption enthalpies for C3H8 and C2H6 gas molecules, and the reduced C3H8 and C2H6 gas diffusion coefficients in SNNU&#8208;Bai78. Very interestingly, this work is the first example of finely tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs toward strengthened host&#8211;guest interactions for the gas adsorption and separation.

         <title>Photoresponsive Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous liquids have typically focused on static components which require temperature and pressure swings, or sonication, to release gas from the system. Here, a new photoresponsive type&#8197;III porous liquid is reported, formed by dispersing a known photoresponsive metal&#8211;organic framework in an ionic liquid, creating a porous liquid capable of releasing gas upon irradiation with UV light.







Abstract
Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free&#8208;flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non&#8208;porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release which involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO2 over CH4 and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Molybdenocenes with Strong Metabolic Effects Inhibit Tumour Growth in Mice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molybdenocenes containing lipophilic substituted Cp ligands as well as bioactive chelating ligands have shown cytotoxicity against lung, colon and ovarian cancer in&#8197;vitro; one complex showed the greatest anticancer activity of any Mo&#8208;based agent known to date. Significant tumour growth inhibition was observed in in&#8197;vivo studies while proteomics showed the most active compound had a strong effect on cellular metabolic processes.







Abstract
A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In vitro experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts. In vivo experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8722;Cp)2MoCl2 and the in&#8197;vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.

         <title>Programmable Photocatalytic Activity of Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks Used as Metallaphotocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various multicomponent COFs bearing both a moiety for photosensitization and complexation of nickel catalysts were synthesized using reticulation with different 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene nodes. This enabled the switching between persistent, charge&#8208;separated species or efficient charge&#8208;carrier mobility for different metallaphotocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions based on the node unit. The frameworks showed recyclability and the possibility to drive the reactions using red light irradiation.







Abstract
The multicomponent approach allows to incorporate several functionalities into a single covalent organic framework (COF) and consequently allows the construction of bifunctional materials for cooperative catalysis. The well&#8208;defined structure of such multicomponent COFs is furthermore ideally suited for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. We report a series of multicomponent COFs that contain acridine&#8208; and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable the usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto&#8208;enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge&#8208;separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel&#8208;loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross&#8208;couplings even using red light irradiation.

We report a series of multicomponent COFs that contain acridine- and 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5-benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable the usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light-mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross-couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto-enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge-carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge-separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel-loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross-couplings even using red light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recyclable GO&#8208;Arginine Hybrids for CO2 Fixation into Cyclic Carbonates</title>

CO2 fix: A new covalently modified graphene&#8722;arginine oxide has been synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale, spectroscopically characterized and effectively used for CO2 fixation and transformation into cyclic carbonates. Dedicated control experiments led to a full rationale of the reaction profile.







Abstract
New covalently modified GO&#8208;guanidine materials have been realized in a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and purified by an innovative microfiltration. The use of these composites in the fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates is demonstrated. Mild operating conditions, high yields (up to 85&#8201;%), wide scope (15 examples) and recoverability/reusability (up to 5 cycles) of the material account for the efficiency of the protocol. Dedicated control experiments shed light on the activation modes exerted by GO&#8208;l&#8208;arginine during the ring&#8208;opening/closing synthetic sequence.

Cyclodextrins. Attachment of a bis&#8208;mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate terminated glycan to &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin increases both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome, indicating potential application for improved treatments for lysosomal metabolite accumulation







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) and derivatives are approved therapeutics in &gt;30 clinical settings. &#946;&#8208;CDs have also shown promise as therapeutics for treatment of some lysosomal storage disorders, such as Niemann&#8208;Pick disease type C, and other disease states which involve metabolite accumulation in the lysosome. In these cases, &#946;&#8208;CD activity relies on transport to the lysosome, wherein it can bind hydrophobic substrate and effect extraction. The post&#8208;translational attachment of N&#8208;glycans terminated in mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) residues is the predominant method by which lysosomal enzymes are targeted to the lysosome. In this work we covalently attach a synthetic biantennary bis&#8208;M6P&#8208;terminated N&#8208;glycan to &#946;&#8208;CD and study the effect of the added glycans in a mammalian cell line. The formation of a host guest complex with a Cy5 fluorophore allows study of both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome by fluorescence microscopy. Results indicate that the rates of both internalisation and lysosomal transport are increased by the attachment of M6P&#8208;glycans to &#946;&#8208;CD, indicating that M6P&#8208;glycan conjugation may improve the therapeutic effectiveness of &#946;&#8208;CD for the treatment of disorders involving hydrophobic metabolite accumulation in the lysosome.

         <title>Merging Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Functionalization and Cascade Cyclization to Enable Propargylic Alcohols as Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reverse regioselective insertion of propargyl alcohols into a rhodacycle is utilized to achieve indole&#8208;based precursors of a vinylogous iminium ion intermediate. Generation and trapping of this intermediate in&#8197;situ with different internal and external nucleophiles results in polycyclic cores of indole&#8208;containing natural products. Experimental studies along with DFT, NCI plots throw light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Reported herein is a reactivity of propargyl alcohols as &#8220;Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons&#8221; in a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of acetanilides, leading to the synthesis of core structures of isocryptolepine, &#947;&#8208;carbolines, dihydrochromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles, and diindolylmethanes (DIM) derivatives. The transformation involves a rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and heteroannulation to yield indoles followed by a cascade cyclization with both external and internal nucleophiles to afford diverse products. The role of the hydroxy group, the key function of the silver additive, the origin of the reverse regioselectivity and the rate&#8208;determining step, are rationalized in conformity with the combination of experimental, noncovalent interaction analysis and DFT studies. This protocol is endowed with several salient features, including one&#8208;pot multistep cascade approach, exclusive regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance and synthesis of variety of molecular frameworks.

         <title>Coordination of Pnictogenylboranes Towards Tl(I) Salts and a Tl&#8208; Mediated P&#8722;P Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of NMe3&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes with Tl(I) salts of weakly coordinating anions led to rare examples of Tl coordination compounds [Tl(EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3)n]+ (n=1, 3; E=P, As) featuring mono and threefold coordination of pnictogenylboranes. In addition, by using CH2Cl2 as a solvent, an unprecedented, Tl&#8208;promoted P&#8722;P coupling was observed, leading to [Me3N&#8901;BH2PH2&#8208;PHBH2&#8901;NMe3]+. During these investigations, novel Tl[WCA] salts were prepared and the synthesis of EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3 was improved towards greater accessibility.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of only Lewis&#8208;base (LB)&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3 (E=P, As) towards Tl(I) salts has been studied. The reaction of Tl[BArCl] (BArCl=[B(3,5&#8208;C6H3Cl2)4]&#8722;) with the corresponding pnictogenylborane results in the formation of [Tl(EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3)][BArCl] (1&#8201;a: E=P; 1&#8201;b: E=As). Whereas the Tl ion in 1&#8201;a/b is monocoordinated, the exchange of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the Tl(I) salt leads to the formation of a trigonal pyramidal coordination mode at the Tl atom by coordination of three equivalents of EH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 in [Tl(EH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3)3][WCA] (2&#8201;a: E=P, WCA=TEFCl; 2&#8201;b: E=As, WCA=TEF) (TEF=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;, TEFCl=[Al{(OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4]&#8722;). Furthermore, by using two equivalents of PH2BH2&#8901;NMe3, a Tl(I)&#8208;mediated P&#8722;P coupling takes place in CH2Cl2 as solvent resulting in [Me3N&#8901;BH2PH2PHBH2&#8901;NMe3][WCA] (WCA=TEF, 3&#8201;a; BArCl, 3&#8201;b; TEFCl, 3&#8201;c). In contrast, for the arsenic derivatives 1&#8201;b and 2&#8201;b, no coupling reaction is observed. The underlying chemical processes are elucidated by quantum chemical computations.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Lanthanide MOF Materials Encapsulated with Viologen Derivatives: Characterization, Photophysical Properties and Sensing on Nitrophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six novel 3D Ln&#8208;NH2BDC MOFs encapsulating pbpyCl2 have been designed and synthesized. They are sensitive to visible light and exhibit a good reversible photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence phenomena. Moreover, they have a good detection effect on nitrophenols, especially 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenol (TNP).







Abstract
Viologens (1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyls) possessing electron&#8208;deficient properties and redox activity are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8211;organic hybrid photochromic materials. Thus, viologen&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties; however, the syntheses of lanthanide&#8208;viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials still face many challenges. For example, the structures and properties of the final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations. In this work, host&#8208;guest composite&#8208;material Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs were constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl2. The pbpy2+ moieties are uniformly embed by their &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure by electrostatic interactions. Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy2+ moieties, Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs have reversible photochromic properties: they can change color after irradiation and can return to the original color after being protected from light or heating. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity decreases with illumination time and recovers in the dark. As a result, Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs show both photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence. Based on the outstanding fluorescence performance of the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs, they also show a wonderful effect for detecting nitrophenols, especially TNP.

         <title>Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive Chromism of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Bisflavin Based on the Aggregation and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisflavin 1&#8201;a exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsive chromism: The fluorescent color of 1&#8201;a can be controlled upon variation of concentration, temperature, solvent, and additives based on the specific aggregation and redox properties arising from highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform. The utility is demonstrated by multi&#8208;colored drawing with 1&#8201;a inks with various concentrations.







Abstract
Multistimuli&#8208;responsive chromism was observed for vinylene&#8208;linked bisflavin 1&#8201;a with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform. The yellow emission of a dilute solution of 1&#8201;a in CHCl3 (0.2&#8197;mM) observed at 298&#8197;K under UV excitation was changed to orange or red emission upon (1) an increase of concentration, (2) a decrease of temperature, and (3) variation of the solvent. This is in contrast to the almost non stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism of the N&#8208;methylated bisflavin analogue 1&#8201;b and monoflavin 2&#8201;a. Mechanistic investigation by 1H NMR analysis under various conditions revealed that the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation platform and imide moiety of 1&#8201;a generate controllability in the formation of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;ordered aggregates, which induce variation of the emission color upon change. Bisflavin 1&#8201;a also exhibited redox&#8208;induced chromism, where the orange emission of 1&#8201;a was quenched by the addition of hydrazine under anaerobic conditions, and changed back to the original emission upon subsequent bubbling of O2 gas.

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Thiourea S&#8208;Oxides through Direct Thiourea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulking up: Thiourea S&#8208;oxides are usually short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates in the oxidation of thioureas and can be considered as heavier homologues of the elusive N&#8208;heterocyclic Criegee intermediates. Preparation and isolation was possible by introduction of bulky substituents on the nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Thiourea S&#8208;oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates (urea O&#8208;oxides). However, the preparation of such S&#8208;oxides is rather challenging, and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D4 double hybrid density functional, it was found that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea S&#8208;oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong &#960;&#8208;donation from the thiourea's nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea S&#8208;oxides in isolated yields of 35&#8211;40&#8201;%. The S&#8208;oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl&#8208;substituted thiourea S&#8208;oxide complexed with residual mCBA could be characterized by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino&#8208;substituted C=S+&#8722;O&#8722; moiety.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bulking up&lt;/b&gt;: Thiourea &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxides are usually short-lived reactive intermediates in the oxidation of thioureas and can be considered as heavier homologues of the elusive N-heterocyclic Criegee intermediates. Preparation and isolation was possible by introduction of bulky substituents on the nitrogen atoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiourea &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino-substituted Criegee intermediates (urea &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-oxides). However, the preparation of such &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxides is rather challenging, and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD-PBEP86-D4 double hybrid density functional, it was found that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong &#960;-donation from the thiourea's nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxides in isolated yields of 35&#8211;40&#8201;%. The &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl-substituted thiourea &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxide complexed with residual &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;CBA could be characterized by means of X-ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino-substituted C=S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; moiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been developed. This process allows direct access to &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers, which cannot be formed in analogous catalytic reactions. The silyl&#8208;protected carboxylic acid generated from acrylic acid and a hydrosilane indicates a good affinity with CuH catalysis than other alkenes to form the copper enolate dominantly.







Abstract
Stereoselective construction of unprotected &#946;&#8208;amino acids is a significant challenge owing to the lack of methods for the catalytic generation of highly enantioenriched carboxylic acid enolates. In this study, a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed, which provides a direct and scalable synthetic method for enantioenriched &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers. The protocol features in&#8197;situ generation of transiently protected carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane and their diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling with ketimines. The synthetic utility of this process was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescent Materials with Multiple Emission Colors and Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>

A straightforward heat&#8208;treatment strategy is proposed to load 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride into the matrix of boric acid to produce powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. The confinement effect of boric acid is responsible for the high emission efficiency of products.







Abstract
Developing solid luminescent materials with a unity quantum yield and tunable emission color is promising, although it is still a difficult task. A straightforward heat&#8208;treatment method has been developed to load 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) into the matrix of boric acid (BA) to produce powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. Our results suggest that the emission of the powders originates from PTCDA, and the tunability of the emission color is caused by the hydrolysis of PTCDA in the alkaline environment. The near&#8208;unity quantum yield is attributed to the BA matrix, which confines PTCDA. In addition, the powder also shows excellent thermal stability that allows its application in light&#8208;emitting diodes. The above results are important for the development of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials for various applications, and also provide a clue for studying the emission properties of luminescent materials.

         <title>Aluminium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8722;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CBG aluminium&#8208;dihydride (I) is used as a catalyst for reducing esters with good tolerance of reducible functionalities. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that compound I catalyzed the hydroboration of epoxides into Markovnikov&#8208;branched products. The earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive Al&#8208;based catalysts are attractive and alternatives to expensive transition and lanthanide&#8208;based metal catalysts.







Abstract
In this work, the molecular aluminium dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminium dihydride in the C&#8722;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.

Good chemistry, like great music, sometimes needs a good collaboration. The Cover Picture shows a combination of nitrogen&#8208;deleting anomeric amide power (discovered by Levin's group from the University of Chicago) and parallel synthesis capabilities of Ukrainian chemists, which resulted in a combinatorial library obtained through formal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling and a unique synthetically accessible chemical space of nearly 600&#8197;K representatives.

         <title>Oxidative N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalysis are reviewed according to the strategies that rely on typical NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, including acyl/imidoyl azolium, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium, and azolium peroxide species, as well as NHC&#8208;derived ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM), aza&#8208;fulvene, and triaza&#8208;diene intermediates, with particular focus on mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is a by now consolidated organocatalytic platform for a number of synthetic (asymmetric) transformations via diverse reaction modes/intermediates. In addition to the typical umpolung processes involving acyl anion/homoenolate equivalent species, implementation of protocols under oxidative conditions greatly expands the possibilities of this methodology. Oxidative NHC&#8208;catalysis allows for oxidative and oxygenative transformations through specific manipulations of Breslow&#8208;type species depending upon the oxidant used (external oxidant or O2/air), the derived NHC&#8208;bound intermediates paving the way to non&#8208;umpolung processes through activation of carbon atoms and heteroatoms. This review is intended to update the state of the art in oxidative NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that appeared in the literature from 2014 to present, with a strong focus to crucial intermediates and their mechanistic implications.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 4, January 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free metal halide Perovskite nanocrystals have emerged with promising properties to circumvent the important issues that still need to be addressed, such as stability and Pb toxicity, to enable practical and safe applications of perovskites.







Abstract
Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A=CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8722;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Ring Opening of Cyclic Amines with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong boron Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 in combination with phenylsilane enables the regioselective cleavage of one out of two or three carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in cyclic secondary and tertiary amines, respectively. This amine deconstruction extends to large saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the functional&#8208;group tolerance is good.







Abstract
Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fission of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen&#8208;containing skeletons.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The strong boron Lewis acid&lt;/b&gt; B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in combination with phenylsilane enables the regioselective cleavage of one out of two or three carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in cyclic secondary and tertiary amines, respectively. This amine deconstruction extends to large saturated nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and the functional-group tolerance is good.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fission of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen-containing skeletons. Unlike approaches starting from cyclic tertiary amines, methods that can directly open secondary amines are still scarce. The present work discloses an efficient reductive ring opening of either of these cyclic amines using PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalysis. By this, the direct transformation of unstrained cyclic amines into the corresponding acyclic amines is achieved in a simple one-pot operation. A stepwise mechanism proceeding through the intermediacy of silylammonium ions followed by reductive cleavage of a carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond was experimentally verified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Catalyzed Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones: A Solvent Controlled Divergent Access of gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Containing Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in a divergent fashion. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to various styrene derivatives benefitted with the formation of two essential classes of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing tetrahydrofuran&#8208;ring and linear ketones in a divergent fashion. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations strongly support the proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
Selective defluorinative functionalization of trifluoromethyl ketones is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the exhaustive mode of the process. To meet the demands for the installation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene unit for the construction of the molecular architectures of well&#8208;known pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, a distinct pathway is thereby highly desirable. Here, a protocol is introduced that allows the divergent synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene group containing tetrahydrofuran derivatives and linear ketones via single C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis in the presence of suitable olefins as trapping partner. The choice of appropriate solvent and catalyst plays a significant role in controlling the divergent behavior of this protocol. Highly reducing photo&#8208;excited catalysts are found to be responsible for the generation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketone (DFMK) radicals as the key intermediate via a SET process. This protocol also results in a high diastereoselectivity towards the formation of partially fluorinated cyclic ketal derivatives with simultaneous construction of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;O bonds. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations are performed to address the origin of diastereoselectivity as well as the divergence of this protocol.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Holey Graphene Modified Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/C as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode for Rechargeable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional holey graphene modified Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/C cathode has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable solid&#8208;state ball milling and calcination processes with holey graphene (HG) as the conductive carrier and sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as the precursors. The introduction of HG has greatly improved the electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion kinetics of the electrode.







Abstract
Polyanion&#8208;type Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low cost and high safety. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) holey graphene (HG) modified NFPP/C material (NFPPCHG) has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable ball milling strategy with sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as precursors. The introduction of HG can obviously improve the specific surface area, electronic conductivity, and ions transport performance of NFPPCHG and largely enhance its electrochemical properties. The prepared NFPPCHG delivers a high reversible capacity of 118&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and keeps a considerable capacity of 53&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at an ultrahigh rate of 100&#8197;C. NFPPCHG also shows excellent performance at 55&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, in situ distribution of relaxation time analysis further demonstrates NFPPCHG has superior electrochemical kinetics. In addition, the HC//NFPPCHG full cell displays good performance, suggesting great potential of the prepared material for practical applications.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray Triggered Coordination&#8208;Bond Breakage in Dysprosium&#8208;Organic Framework and its Impact on Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray (&#955;=0.71073&#8197;&#197;) irradiation induces the breakage of Dy&#8722;OH2 coordination bond in a 3D framework Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X). The phase transition is accompanied with significant change in the magnetic properties due to the change in the coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.







Abstract
Photosensitive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (Ln&#8722;SMM) are very attractive for their potential applications in information storage, switching, and sensors. However, the light&#8208;driven structural transformation in Ln&#8722;SMMs hardly changes the coordination number of the lanthanide ion. Herein, for the first time it is reported that X&#8208;ray (&#955;=0.71073&#8197;&#197;) irradiation can break the coordination bond of Dy&#8722;OH2 in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic framework Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), in which the {Dy2(OPO)2} dimers are cross&#8208;linked by dianthracene&#8208;phosphonate ligands. The structural transformation proceeds in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) fashion, forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X). The phase transition is accompanied by a significant change in magnetic properties due to the alteration in coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.

         <title>ZnTe/rGO Composite as the Fully Zinced Conversion&#8208;Type Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion between ZnTe and Te leads to an ultra&#8208;flat discharge plateau, and avoids &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polytellurides in aqueous electrolyte. Besides, fully zinced ZnTe in graphene wrapping shrinkage when charged to Te, providing spare space to alleviate volume expansion of Te during discharge. As a result, ZnTe/rGO composite exhibits high capacity, stable output voltage and good cycle stability.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) can provide flat plateau slop and stable output potential, compared to general intercalation&#8208;type cathodes.

     alt="ZnTe/rGO Composite as the Fully Zinced Conversion-Type Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solid-to-solid conversion between ZnTe and Te leads to an ultra-flat discharge plateau, and avoids &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polytellurides in aqueous electrolyte. Besides, fully zinced ZnTe in graphene wrapping shrinkage when charged to Te, providing spare space to alleviate volume expansion of Te during discharge. As a result, ZnTe/rGO composite exhibits high capacity, stable output voltage and good cycle stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversion-type cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) can provide flat plateau slop and stable output potential, compared to general intercalation-type cathodes. The high volumetric capacity and stable output potential of Te make it a promising cathode for ZIBs, but sluggish kinetics and large volume change hinder its further application. To address these issues, we revisit fully zinced ZnTe and construct ZnTe/rGO composites as the new conversion-type cathode. The electrode undergoes a solid-to-solid conversion reaction and shows a stable output potential with ultra-flat discharge plateau slop of 0.09&#8197;V (Ah&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. When ZnTe is de-zinced and transformed to Te during charge process, it has a volume shrinkage which generates empty space in graphene matrix for latter volume expansion of Te. The graphene matrix also improves conductivity and reaction kinetics of the cathode. Due to the combination of pre-zincation of ZnTe, graphene matrix and the elimination of &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; process, ZnTe/rGO electrode exhibits a high and stable capacity of 186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 300 cycling, with almost no decay after initial 10 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Distance&#8208;Triggered Distinct Aryl Migrations on Azidodiboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two bis&#8208;haloboranes fused by biphenylene and xanthrene were employed to construct azidodiboranes but resulted in different products. The boron&#8208;boron separation distances were identified as the intrinsic factors for the pathway&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Derived from structurally similar precursors, two different azidodiboranes went through distinct aryl migration reactions triggered by different boron&#8208;boron separation distances. Biphenylene based diborane with a shorter boron&#8208;boron distance underwent heterolateral aryl migration to form a seven&#8208;membered azadiborepin, while xanthrene based diborane with a longer boron&#8208;boron distance afforded a stable bis&#8208;azidoborane scaffold. The pyrolysis of such a bis&#8208;azidoborane led to eight&#8208;membered oxazadiborocine through homolateral aryl migration and subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the boron&#8208;boron separation distances were the intrinsic factors for the distinct migrations.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization of Hypervalent Carbon Compounds Bearing 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton: Penta&#8208; versus Tetra&#8208;Coordinate Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds were characterized by gas&#8208;phase techniques, including photodissociation spectroscopy and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. For a compound with moderate electron&#8208;donating ligands bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, coexistence of penta&#8208; and tetra&#8208;coordinate forms was revealed, highlighting the significant effects of the environments on the stability of hypervalent carbons.







Abstract
In this study, we afford explicit characterizations of the electronic and geometrical structures of recently reported hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds by using gas&#8208;phase characterization techniques: photodissociation spectroscopy (PDS) and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS). In particular for a compound with moderately electron&#8208;donating ligands, bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, the coexistence of tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate isomers is confirmed, consistent with solution characterizations. It is in sharp contrast to the exclusive tetra&#8208;coordinate form (with normal valence of the central carbon atom) in the single crystal. This suggests that a non&#8208;polar environment makes the penta&#8208;coordinate structure thermodynamically most stable. This delicate difference between the tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate structures, which depends on the environment, is a close reflection of the lower activation barrier of the SN2 reaction found in neutral solvent or gas&#8208;phase reactions.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts via Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry involves selective biocompatible reactions between functional groups that are not normally present in biology. It has been used to probe biomolecules in living systems, and has advanced biomedical strategies such as diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, challenges and opportunities encountered when translating in vitro bioorthogonal approaches to in vivo settings are presented with a focus on methods to deliver the bioorthogonal reaction components. These methods include metabolic bioengineering, active targeting, passive targeting, and simultaneously used strategies. The suitability of bioorthogonal ligation reactions and bond cleavage reactions for in vivo applications is critically appraised, and practical considerations such as the optimum scheduling regimen in pretargeting approach are discussed.

         <dc:description>Construction of sub&#8208;5 nm long&#8208;range ordered structures through self&#8208;assembly has received increasing attention. Herein, a series of ODMS&#8208;based thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) containing perylene diimide (PDI) were designed and synthesized. These LCs can form ordered nanostructures with periodic sizes around 5 nm including smectic J (SmJ), oblique columnar (Colob), and hexagonal columnar (Colh) phases with change in the volume fraction of ODMS, where the layer spacing of the SmJ phase is less than 5 nm. Thin films with parallel oriented nanolines with line width less than 5 nm can be obtained on PDMS&#8208;modified silicon substrates by spin&#8208;casting and simple thermal annealing processes. Moreover, owing to the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between PDI cores, these nanolines are long&#8208;range ordered with uniaxial orientation in relatively large areas (1.5&#215;1.5 &#956;m2) with over 300 continuous microdomains without pre&#8208;patterning.

         <title>Facile synthesis of bis&#8208;pentafluoroarylated anthracene derivatives for n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diphenylanthracene (DPA) and its derivatives are promising semiconducting materials for p&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, to develop n&#8208;type semiconducting materials with an anthracene core, pentafluorobenzene was introduced into anthracene via C&#8211;H direct arylation, enabling the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (DPA&#8208;F) derivatives. The high reactivity of the pentafluorobenzene C&#8211;H bond allows direct arylation for synthesizing DPA&#8208;F derivatives in a single step. The introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups provides the anthracene derivatives with n&#8208;type semiconducting properties, in contrast to the p&#8208;type properties of the parent DPAs. Among the synthesized compounds, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene shows a high electron mobility of 0.12 &#177; 0.02 cm2/Vs and an on/off ratio &gt;106 in OFETs. The high crystallinity results in the smooth electron transport. This study provides a facile synthetic method for n&#8208;type semiconducting materials and insights into the molecular design of the positional effects of aromatic substituents on anthracene.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium
salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum
chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and
trimethylamine, exhibiting similar pK a values, both facilitate the complex formation.
However, in contrast to experiments, these calculations show a slightly lower barrier with the
amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and
imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keeps these species associated in
solution through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters
that are essential for the metal complex formation. The neutral amine, however, remains
mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective
base.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
On&#8208;DNA! Aspartic acid&#8208;derived Wittig ylides were generated onto DNA and have been validated for Wittig olefination with various aldehydes to develop on&#8208;DNA

&#8208;unsaturated peptidomimetics. These were further converted into heterocyclic core&#8208;containing peptidomimetics through diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS).







Abstract
The DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology represents a revolutionary drug&#8208;discovery tool with unprecedented screening power originating from the association of combinatorial chemistry and DNA barcoding. The chemical diversity of DELs and its chemical space will be further expanded as new DNA&#8208;compatible reactions are introduced. This work introduces the use of DOS in the context of on&#8208;DNA peptidomimetics. Wittig olefination of aspartic acid&#8208;derived on&#8208;DNA Wittig ylide, combined with a broad substrate scope of aldehydes, led to formation of on&#8208;DNA 
,
&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The synthesis of on&#8208;DNA multi&#8208;peptidyl&#8208;ylides was performed by incorporating sequential amino acids onto a monomeric ylide. Di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrameric peptidyl&#8208;ylides were validated for Wittig olefination and led to on&#8208;DNA 
,
&#8208;unsaturated&#8208;based peptidomimetics, an important class of intermediates. One on&#8208;DNA aryl Wittig ylide was also developed and applied to Wittig olefination for synthesis of on&#8208;DNA chalcone&#8208;based molecules. Furthermore, DOS was used successfully with electron&#8208;deficient peptidomimetics and led to the development of different heterocyclic cores containing on&#8208;DNA peptidomimetics.

         <title>Influence of Triptycene Annulation on the Photochromism of Diphenylnaphthopyrans: Entropic Control of Thermal Reversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropically&#8208;controlled photochromism: The proximal and distal annulation of naphthopyran with rigid triptycene leads to regioisomeric naphthopyrans, which display highly divergent photochromic behaviors. The proximate isomer is so strained that its photogenerated colored open form enjoys more freedom to resist back cyclization. This constitutes the first example of entropically&#8208;controlled photochromism for the celebrated class of naphthopyrans.







Abstract
Regioisomeric naphthopyrans annulated with triptycene, i.&#8201;e., Prox&#8208;NP and Dist&#8208;NP, display divergent photochromic behaviors. While steady&#8208;state photolysis of Dist&#8208;NP led to a very labile colored intermediate that is not observable at room temperature, Prox&#8208;NP yielded a remarkably stable species characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as the TT isomer of o&#8208;quinonoid intermediate (Prox&#8208;NPQ) with t1/2 ca. 0.18&#8197;years at 298&#8197;K. The kinetic analysis of thermal reversion reveals that the bleaching of Prox&#8208;NPQ is entropically controlled; the steric effect due to the rigid triptycene scaffold renders Prox&#8208;NP a highly constrained system such that the photogenerated colored o&#8208;quinonoid form is more entropically relaxed. This constitutes the first instance of an entropically&#8208;controlled thermal reversion for the celebrated class of photochromic naphthopyrans. Based on the response of Prox&#8208;NP and its colored intermediate Prox&#8208;NPQ to different stimuli, namely, light, heat, and acid, the molecular system can be likened to a logic gate with the &#8216;INHIBIT&#8217; function.

         <title>The Effect of Hydrogenation on the Contest between Aromaticity and Antiaromaticity in Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off&#8208;nucleus isotropic shielding isosurfaces computed using DFT show that a key feature of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), its antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered cyclic conjugated subsystem with 16 &#960; electrons that is formally preserved in all hydrogenated norcorroles, unexpectedly becomes less and less antiaromatic in the series H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc, which is predicted to end in the completely nonaromatic H8NiNc.







Abstract
Magnetic shielding studies demonstrate that successive hydrogenation of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), a stable molecule combining aromatic and antiaromatic features, first weakens and then eliminates the central antiaromatic region, even though the NiNc antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered conjugated cycle with 16 &#960; electrons, is formally preserved throughout the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series. The differences between aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic isotropic shielding distributions and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) values in these hydrogenated porphyrin analogues are highlighted by comparing the results for the members of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series to those for the aromatic NiII porphyrin complex. The results strongly support the unexpected and counterintuitive conclusion that H8NiNc will be nonaromatic, without even a trace of antiaromaticity. Based on these findings, H8NiNc is predicted to be the most stable member of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series.

The electrical plugs highlight the alkyne carbons attacked by the palladium catalyst, which then undergoes transmetalation with the arylboronic acid. Typical combinations of the ligand and alkyne substituent to give endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts are shown on the boxes at the end of the outlets. Methanol as solvent not only activates the carbonyl oxygen, but also promotes transmetalation with the arylboronic acid. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsukamoto and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203068).

Schematic illustration of &#945;&#8208;HER2M IgG modification in a 2&#8208;step approach using a redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging and an azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
A highly effective 2&#8208;step system for site&#8208;specific antibody modification and conjugation of the monoclonal antibody Herceptin (commercially available under Trastuzumab) in a cysteine&#8208;independent manner was used to generate labelled antibodies for in vivo imaging. The first step contains redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging (ReACT) of thioethers via engineered methionine residues to introduce specific alkyne moieties, thereby offering a novel easy way to fundamentally change the process of antibody bioconjugation. The second step involves modification of the introduced alkyne via azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition &#8242;click&#8242; conjugation. The versatility of this 2&#8208;step approach is demonstrated here by the selective incorporation of a fluorescent dye but can also be applied to a wide variety of different conjugation partners depending on the desired application in a facile manner. Methionine&#8208;modified antibodies were characterised in vitro, and the diagnostic potential of the most promising variant was further analysed in an in vivo xenograft animal model using a fluorescence imaging modality. This study demonstrates how methionine&#8208;mediated antibody conjugation offers an orthogonal and versatile route to the generation of tailored antibody conjugates with in vivo applicability.

         <dc:description>Achieving site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity is enormously challenging for substrates with multi&#8208;reactive sites in organic reactions.

When we screened the reaction conditions, we inspiringly found that the different bases controlled the palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity of the substrates: (i) Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) promoted the benzyl C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of the substrates providing dihydropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones at 100 oC, and isomerization of the dihydropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones gave isoquinoline derivatives at a higher temperature (140 oC); (ii) Sodium acetate (NaOAc) mediated the aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation of the substrates affording seven&#8208;membered biphenyl N&#8208;heterocycles; (iii) Sodium dichloroacetate (Cl2HCCO2Na) facilitated occurrence of the reductive Heck reaction of the substrates affording 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoindol&#8208;2(8H)&#8208;ones; (iv) Sodium trifluoroacetate (F3CCO2Na) assisted performance of the domino Heck reaction/aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of the substrates leading to the spiro heterocycles.

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Modulation of Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene, molecular motor, etc.) were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light (CPL) was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of CPL have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad&#8208;scope Syntheses of [11C/18F]Trifluoromethylarenes from Aryl(mesityl)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for labeling aryl trifluoromethyl groups to provide novel radiotracers for use in biomedical research with positron emission tomography (PET) are keenly sought. We report a broad&#8208;scope method for labeling trifluoromethylarenes with either carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min) or fluorine&#8208;18 (t1/2 =109.8 min) from readily accessible aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts. In this method, the aryl(mesityl)iodonium salt is treated rapidly with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]CuCF3 or [18F]CuCF3. The mesityl group acts as a spectator allowing radiolabeled trifluoromethylarenes to be obtained with very high chemoselectivity. Radiochemical yields from aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts bearing either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at meta&#8208; or para&#8208; position are good to excellent (67&#8211;96%). Ortho&#8208;substituted and otherwise sterically hindered trifluoromethylarenes still give good yields (15&#8211;34%). Substituted heteroaryl(mesityl)iodonium salts are also viable substrates. The broad scope of this method was further exemplified by labeling a previously inaccessible target, [11C]p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid, as a potentially helpful labeling synthon. In addition, fluoxetine, leflunomide, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminopyridine, as examples of small drug&#8208;like molecules and candidate PET radioligands, were successfully labeled in high yields (69&#8211;81%).</dc:description>

Radiochemical yields from aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts bearing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at meta- or para- position are good to excellent (67&#8211;96%). Ortho-substituted and otherwise sterically hindered trifluoromethylarenes still give good yields (15&#8211;34%). Substituted heteroaryl(mesityl)iodonium salts are also viable substrates. The broad scope of this method was further exemplified by labeling a previously inaccessible target, [11C]p-trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid, as a potentially helpful labeling synthon. In addition, fluoxetine, leflunomide, and 3-trifluoromethyl-4-aminopyridine, as examples of small drug-like molecules and candidate PET radioligands, were successfully labeled in high yields (69&#8211;81%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;line multidimensional NMR monitoring of photochemical flow reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. The reaction mixture exiting the flow reactor is flown trough the NMR spectrometer and directly analysed. In the case of simple substrates, suitable information can be obtained through 1D&#160;1H spectra, but for molecules of higher complexity the use of 2D experiments is key to address signal overlaps and assignment issues. Here we show the usefulness of ultrafast 2D COSY experiments acquired in 70 s or less, for the in&#8208;line monitoring of photochemical reactions, and the possibility to obtain reliable quantitative information. This is a powerful framework to, e.g., efficiently screen reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article summarizes the progress of the reductive coupling of chlorosilanes by nickel catalysis. This method enables cheap, stable, and readily available carbon and silicon reagents to be coupled, offering a mild and high functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerance route to synthesize organosilanes.







Abstract
Organosilanes play essential roles in many important research areas. The use of readily available chlorosilanes to catalytically access these compounds is synthetically appealing but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has recently emerged as a promising protocol to arrive at this goal. This strategy allows the chlorosilanes to be coupled with various carbon electrophiles under mild conditions. These reactions afford organosilanes with improved molecular diversity, structural complexity, and functional group compatibility. This Concept article summarizes the recent advance on nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#8722;Si couplings of chlorosilanes.

Ge&#8208;fused azobenzene compounds: Hypervalent compounds with a germanium(Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffold exhibiting NIR emission despite the compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The synergistic effect between a hypervalent bond and the extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation is a novel and effective strategy for obtaining NIR emissive materials.







Abstract
A novel molecular design for showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is still required for satisfying growing demands for NIR&#8208;light technology. In this research, hypervalent compounds with germanium (Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffolds were discovered that can exhibit NIR emission (&#955;PL=690&#8764;721&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=0.03&#8764;0.04) despite compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The unique optical properties are derived from the trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the hypervalent compounds constructed by combination of Ge and azobenzene&#8208;based tridentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical calculation results disclosed that the germanium&#8208;nitrogen (Ge&#8722;N) coordination at the equatorial position strongly reduces the energy level of the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), and the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3&#8201;c&#8211;4&#8201;e) bond in the apical position effectively rises the energy level of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital). It is emphasized that large narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is achieved just by forming the hypervalent bond. In addition, the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap property can be enhanced by extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The obtained &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer shows efficient NIR emission both in solution (&#955;PL=770&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.10) and film (&#955;PL=807&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.04). These results suggest that collaboration of a hypervalent bond and a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a novel and effective strategy for tuning electronic properties even in the NIR region.

         <title>Crystal Plane&#8208;Related Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity of Single Hexagonal Co3O4 Spinel Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SECCM measurements together with SEM and AFM are used to determine the intrinsic activity of two different crystallographic planes available at a single hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte of hexagonal spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles derived using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is correlated with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the droplet landing sites. A unique way to deconvolute the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual crystal facets of the hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle is demonstrated in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) of surface Co atoms. The top surface exposing 111 crystal planes displayed a thickness&#8208;dependent TOF with a TOF of about 100&#8197;s&#8722;1 at a potential of 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and a particle thickness of 100&#8197;nm. The edge of the particle exposing (110) planes, however, showed an average TOF of 270&#177;68&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and no correlation with particle thickness. The higher atomic density of Co atoms on the edge surface (2.5 times of the top) renders the overall catalytic activity of the edge planes significantly higher than that of the top planes. The use of a free&#8208;diffusing Os complex in the alkaline electrolyte revealed the low electrical conductivity through individual particles, which explains the thickness&#8208;dependent TOF of the top planes and could be a reason for the low activity of the top (111) planes.

         <title>Revisiting the Reaction of IPr with Tritylium: An Alternative Mechanistic Pathway
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the high ionization energy of imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with oxidants have been postulated to occur via a transient NHC radical cation intermediate. Herein, we propose the alternative mechanism to explain the outcome of the tritylium reaction with IPr without the intermediacy of unstable [IPr]&#8901;+.







Abstract
Despite a recent proposal on the mechanism of a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process between tritylium and 2,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) based on evidence of transient IPr radical cation intermediate ([IPr]&#8901;+) formation, such oxidation is still contentious because of the high oxidation potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Our experimental analysis indicates that the appearance of deep purple color, previously considered to be from transient [IPr]&#8901;+, originates from a zwitterionic intermediate (3&#8201;a), not a radical cation. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism for the reaction involving tritylium and IPr. This mechanism is noteworthy for explaining how [NHC&#8722;H]+ can be generated without the formation of transient [NHC]&#8901;+, which has been frequently proposed as an intermediate for the reaction between NHC and oxidants. These results also show that a transient strong single&#8208;electron donor (3&#8201;a) could be generated by the alternative mechanism for oxidants using NHCs, which is a more feasible explanation for the reactivity of NHCs with oxidants.

         <title>One Carbon Ring Expansion of Bipyrrole to Bipyridine Enables Access to a &#960;&#8208;Extended, Non&#8208;innocent, Corrole&#8208;like Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Diazatriphenylene was synthesized by a double, one&#8208;carbon&#8208;insertion reaction. Following elaboration, this key precursor allowed access to an unprecedented NiII&#8208;bipyricorrole radical and a cationic square planar complex upon one&#8208;electron oxidation.







Abstract
A &#960;&#8208;extended, diaza&#8208;triphenylene embedded, mono&#8208;anionic corrole analogue and its NiII complex were synthesized from a diaza&#8208;triphenylene precursor, which was obtained from a double one&#8208;carbon insertion into a naphthobipyrrole diester. Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with pyrrole, subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde afforded mono&#8208;anionic, &#960;&#8208;extended bipyricorrole&#8208;like macrocycle. Attempted NiII insertion with Ni(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O resulted an ESR active, NiII bipyricorrole radical complex, which was converted to a stable cationic NiII complex upon treatment with [(Et3O)+(SbCl6)&#8722;]. Both complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The NiII bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to a cationic NiII complex by single&#8208;electron reduction using cobaltocene. Both the cationic NiII complex and the radical NiII complex exhibited ligand&#8208;centered redox behavior, whereas the NiII remains in the +2 oxidation state.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrous Oxide by Light Alcohols Catalysed by a Low&#8208;Valent Ruthenium Diazadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decomposition of the environmentally harmful gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is usually performed thermally or catalytically. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is currently the most promising technology for N2O mitigation, a multicomponent heterogeneous catalytic system that employs reducing agents such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or a combination thereof. We report herein the first homogenous catalyst that performs the reduction of nitrous oxide employing readily available and cheap light alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol derivatives. During the reaction, these alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O, later entering the reaction as substrate. The reaction is catalysed by the low&#8208;valent dinuclear ruthenium complex [Ru2H(&#181;&#8208;H)(Me2dad)(dbcot)2] that carries a diazabutadiene, Me2dad, and two rigid dienes, dbcot, as ligands. The reduction of nitrous oxide proceeds with low catalyst loadings under relatively mild conditions (65&#8208;80&#160;&#176;C, 1.4&#160;bar N2O) achieving turnover numbers of up to 480 and turnover frequencies of up to 56&#160;h&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oleyl ligands are known as good dispersants for stabilizing nanoparticles in less&#8208;polar solvents; however, the structure&#8208;dispersibility relationships remain unclear. We synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the relationship and reveal that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors to enhance dispersibility.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) are inherently prone to aggregation and loss of their size&#8208;derived properties, thus it is essential to enhance their dispersibility for applications. In less polar solvents, organic ligands containing oleyl groups are known as good dispersants due to their inefficient shell packing and inhibition of chain&#8211;chain crystallization as well as interdigitation between adjacent NPs. However, reagents with oleyl structures, such as oleic acid and oleylamine, can contain trans double bonds and saturated impurities, which might affect the chemical and/or physical properties of the NPs. Nevertheless, the effect of slight differences in surface ligand structure, including isomers, on the dispersibility of NPs has been little studied. We have synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the structure&#8211;dispersibility relationship in detail. Dynamic light scattering and visible light transmittance revealed that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors in enhancing dispersibility.

         <title>Diarylethene Isomerization by Using Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single green light source is used to selectively control both the ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing reactions of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches, by using green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation photon upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Whilst using TTA&#8208;UC to trigger the ring&#8208;closing reaction, the green light also induces fluorescence from the colored closed isomer of the DAE, which was used as an in&#8208;situ readout to monitor the isomerization process.







Abstract
Green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation photon upconversion with the well&#8208;studied upconversion pair 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA)/platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) was used to reversibly drive the photoisomerization of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches by using visible light. By carefully selecting the kinetic and spectral properties of the molecular system as well as the experimental geometry, a single green light source can be used to selectively trigger both the ring&#8208;opening and the ring&#8208;closing reactions, whilst also inducing fluorescence from the colored closed isomer that can be used as a readout to monitor the isomerization process in&#8197;situ. The upconversion solution and the DAE solution are kept physically separated, allowing them to be characterized both concomitantly and individually without further separation processes. The ring&#8208;closing reaction using upconverted photons was quantified and compared to the efficiency of direct isomerization with ultraviolet light.

         <title>The First Alkaline&#8208;Earth Azidoaurate(III), Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O</title>

Square and planar, but novel and explosive: Cation&#8208;poor Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O forms transparent, dark orange crystals. The highly sensitive compound contains tetraazidoaurate(III) anions with a novel geometry and gold in square&#8208;planar coordination around nitrogen. Extensive vibrational spectroscopic investigations confirm both the anion geometry and the existence of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Transparent, dark orange Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O was synthesized by reaction of Ba(N3)2 and AuCl3 or HAuCl4 in aqueous solution. The novel barium tetraazidoaurate(III) tetrahydrate crystallizes in the monoclinic space group&#8197;Cc (no.&#8197;9) with a=1813.68(17)&#8197;pm, b=1737.95(11)&#8197;pm, c=682.04(8)&#8197;pm and &#946;=108.849(4)&#176;. The predominant structural features of Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O are two crystallographically independent discrete anions [Au(N3)4]&#8722; with gold in a tetragonal planar coordination by nitrogen. Vibrational spectra show good agreement with those of other azidoaurates(III). Upon drying, this salt was shown to be a highly explosive material.

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: From Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast, user&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;efficient labeling strategies were developed for 17O&#8208;enrichment of free amino acids, Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids (produced on 1&#8197;g/day scale) and peptide side&#8208;chains (site&#8208;selective labeling). 17O&#8208;Labeled biomolecules were reproducibly obtained pure, in high synthetic yields (up to 85&#8201;%), and with high enrichment levels (&#8764;40&#8201;%).







Abstract
17O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of 17O (0.04&#8201;%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient 17O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides by using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to &#8764;40&#8201;%, yields &#8764;60&#8208;85&#8201;%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently, 17O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1&#8197;g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective 17O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with &#8764;28&#8201;% enrichment level. For all molecules, 17O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.

         <dc:description>
Work with the elements of nature: Our building block, maytansinol, represented as a constellation of stars, is the main protagonist of the story. A ray of light coming out from it demonstrates how different moieties can be attached to it, opening new horizons. As maytansinoids show a destabilising effect on microtubules, we represent the latter by trees. The tree trunk is a microtubule, from which the tubulins are disassembling into the leaves. The TubInTrain logo in the corner represents the H2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;ITN&#8208;2019 network that made this interdisciplinary investigation possible.

         <title>Exciplex&#8208;forming Cohost Systems with 2,3&#8208;Dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based Acceptors to Achieve Efficient Near Infrared OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new 2,3&#8208;dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based acceptors (A) p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN were synthesized to blend with a donor (D) CPTBF for the exciplex formation. The energy levels of p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN are modulated by the peripheral substituents 4&#8208; and 3&#8208;benzonitrile, respectively. Exciplex&#8208;forming blends were identified by the observation of the red&#8208;shifted emissions from various D:A blends with higher ratios of donor for suppressing the aggregation of acceptor. The two&#8208;component relaxation processes observed by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence support the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) character of the exciplex&#8208;forming blends. The device employing CPTBF:p&#8208;QCN and (2:1) and CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (2:1) blend as the emitting layer (EML) gave EQEmax of 1.76% and 5.12%, and electroluminescence (EL) &#955;max of 629 nm and 618 nm, respectively. The device efficiency can be further improved to 4.32% and 5.57% with CPTBF:p&#8208;QCN and (4:1) and CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1) as the EML, which is consistent with their improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). A new fluorescent emitter BPBBT with photoluminescence (PL) lmax of 726 nm and a high PLQY of 67% was synthesized and utilized as the dopant of CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1) cohost system. The device employing CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1): 5 wt.% BPBBT as the EML gave an EQEmax of 5.02% and EL lmax centered at 735 nm, however, the weak residual exciplex emission remains. By reducing the donor ratio, the exciplex emission can be completely transferred to BPBBT and the corresponding device with CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (2:1): 5 wt.% BPBBT as the EML can achieve EL &#955;max of 743 nm and EQEmax of 4.79%. This work manifests the high efficiency near infrared (NIR) OLED can be realized by triplet excitons harvesting of exciplex&#8208;forming cohost system, followed by the effective energy transfer to an NIR fluorescent dopant.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two new 2,3-dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene-based acceptors (A) p-QCN and m-QCN were synthesized to blend with a donor (D) CPTBF for the exciplex formation. The energy levels of p-QCN and m-QCN are modulated by the peripheral substituents 4- and 3-benzonitrile, respectively. Exciplex-forming blends were identified by the observation of the red-shifted emissions from various D:A blends with higher ratios of donor for suppressing the aggregation of acceptor. The two-component relaxation processes observed by time-resolved photoluminescence support the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) character of the exciplex-forming blends. The device employing CPTBF:p-QCN and (2:1) and CPTBF:m-QCN (2:1) blend as the emitting layer (EML) gave EQEmax of 1.76% and 5.12%, and electroluminescence (EL) &#955;max of 629 nm and 618 nm, respectively.

         <title>Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting PyrrolylBODIPY Dyes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Bioimaging Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with characteristics such as deep tissue penetration, minimal damage to the biological samples, and low background interference, are highly sought&#8208;after materials for in vivo&#160;and deep&#8208;tissue fluorescence imaging. Herein, a series of 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPY derivatives and 3,5&#8208;dipyrrolylBODIPY derivatives&#160;have been prepared by a facile regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr) on 3,5&#8208;halogenated BODIPY derivatives (3,5&#8208;dibromo or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs) with pyrroles.&#160;The installation of a pyrrolic unit onto the 3&#8208;position of the BODIPY chromophore leads to a dramatic red shift of both the absorption (upto 160 nm) and the emission (upto 260 nm) in these resultant 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPYs with respect to that of BODIPY chromophore. Their further 5&#8208;positional functionalization provides a facile way to fine tune their photophysical properties, and these resulting dipyrrolylBODIPYs 4&#160;and functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs&#160;5&#160;show strong absorption in the deep red to NIR (near&#8208;infrared) regions (595 &#8208; 684 nm) and intense NIR fluorescence emission (650 &#8208; 715 nm) in dichloromethane. To demonstrate the applicability of these functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs as NIR fluorescent probes for cell imaging, pyrrolylBODIPY&#160;6a&#160;containing mitochondrion&#8208;targeting butyltriphenylphosphonium cationic species was also prepared.&#160;It selectively localized in mitochondria of HeLa cells, with low cytotoxicity and intense deep red fluorescence emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution from Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Triply Donor&#8208;Substituted Tristriazolotriazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters do not show their RTP in solution. Here, we incorporated sulfur&#8208;containing thiophene bridges between the donor and acceptor moieties in D3A&#8208;type tristriazolotriazines (TTTs). The thiophene inclusion increased the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated with the radiative T1&#8594;S0 pathway allows RTP to be observed in solution for all compounds, likely assisted by protection of the emissive TTT&#8208;thiophene core from the environment by the bulky peripheral donors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Prominence of Facilitator &#960;&#8208;holes: The Classic N&#8592;N Pnictogen Bonding in Nitrobenzene&#8208;Ammonia Dimer with its Structural Elucidation and Experimental Characterization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitrogen of nitro group is a paradigmatic pnictogen due the presence of a &#960;&#8208;hole and a number of studies have been performed recently on prototypical nitromethane (NM). Homodimers and heterodimers of NM are sustained by &#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bonds hosted by nitrogen. To understand the effect of substitution on this &#960;&#8208;hole and thus the pnictogen bond, heterodimers of nitrobenzene (NB; phenyl substitution in place of methyl) with ammonia (AM) have been probed, as a test case, using matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and ab initio computations. Of the four structures optimized in the potential energy surface the energetically dominant global minimum, stabilized by &#960;&#8208;hole driven O=N&#8592;N pnictogen bonding with co&#8208;operative N&#8208;H&#8592;O hydrogen bonding, was experimentally identified at low temperatures. A comparison of the pnictogen bonding of NB&#8208;AM dimers with NM counterpart (NM&#8208;AM dimers) divulged the dominance of electrostatic origin of pnictogen bonding in both the class of dimers. The reduced strength of pnictogen bonding in NB&#8208;AM dimers in comparison to NM&#8208;AM dimers was discerned, which has been established to be a consequence of the reduced electrostatic potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole of NB relative to that in NM. The strength of &#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bond was directly correlated with the binding energy and the infrared shifts in the signature vibrational bands of the NB, NM and AM submolecules due to dimerization under matrix isolated conditions at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Intrinsically Disordered Regions in Transcription Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are the final integrators of a complex molecular feedback mechanism that interfaces with the genome, consolidating information for transcriptional regulation. TFs consist of both structured DNA&#8208;binding domains and long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) embedded with motifs linked to transcriptional control. It is now well established that the dynamic multifunctionality of IDRs is the basis for a wide spectrum of TF functions necessary to navigate and regulate the human genome. This review dissects the chemical features of TF IDRs that endow them with structural plasticity that is central to their functions in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of a set of over 1600 human TFs through AlphaFold was used to identify key features of their IDRs. Recent studies were then highlighted to illustrate IDR involvement in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation. To expand our understanding of TF functions, future directions are suggested for integrating experiments and simulations, from in vitro to living systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Oxidation by a Tungsten Dependent Aldehyde Oxidoreductase from&#160;Aromatoleum Aromaticum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes, which operate at significantly lower redox potentials, have received little attention regarding their ability to participate in electrochemical catalysis. The bacterial tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase from Aromatoleum aromaticum (AOR) has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode to generate a functional system that can electrochemically oxidise a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of any of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two&#8208;electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient process</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derived Terephthalate Ligand Decorated TiO2 with Various Morphologies for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has been rarely reported the morphological control of derivatives of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in hydrothermal conditions for photocatalytic applications. We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid/terephthalate (TPA) and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods). The composites are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as precursor. The formation mechanism of composite materials with different morphological features is discussed. Impressively, the composite of TiO2 nanoparticles/TPA synthesized using H2O as solvent under hydrothermal condition exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 activity among the studied materials, with a photocatalytic H2 production rate of 6.38 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is approximately 7.5&#8208;fold higher than pure TiO2 (Degussa, P25) and prominent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 65% at 365 nm. Furthermore, the mechanism of boosted photocatalytic H2 production is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended q&#8208;range X&#8208;ray Scattering Reveals High&#8208;Resolution Structural Details of Biomacromolecules in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We communicate a feasibility study for high&#8208;resolution structural characterization of biomacromolecules in aqueous solution from X&#8208;ray scattering experiments measured over a range of scattering vectors (q) that is approximately two orders of magnitude wider than used previously for such systems. Scattering data with such an extended q&#8208;range enables the recovery of the underlying real&#8208;space atomic pair distribution function, which facilitates structure determination. We demonstrate the potential of this method for biomacromolecules using several types of cyclodextrins (CD) as model systems. We successfully identified deviations of the tilting angles for the glycosidic units in CDs in aqueous solutions relative to their values in the crystalline forms of these molecules. Such level of structural detail is inaccessible from standard small angle scattering measurements. Our results call for further exploration of ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements for biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Electrochemical Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Quinoline N&#8208;oxides by Cathodic Reduction of Nitro Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple electrochemical reductive protocol was established for the direct formation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides with mild reaction conditions, in an undivided set&#8208;up, with a broad scope. The technical significance of this method could be demonstrated on a multigram scale.







Abstract
The use of electric current in synthetic organic chemistry offers a sustainable tool for the selective reductive synthesis of quinoline N&#8208;oxides starting from easily accessible nitro compounds. The reported method employs mild and reagent&#8208;free conditions, a simple undivided cell, and constant current electrolysis set&#8208;up which provides conversion with a high atom economy. The synthesis of 30 differently substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides was successfully performed in up to 90&#8201;% yield. Using CV studies, the mechanism of the selective formation of the quinoline N&#8208;oxides was elucidated. The technical relevance of the described reaction could be shown in a 50&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up reaction.

Get more from a larger pi: Four &#960;&#8208;extended phosphindolizine derivatives have been synthesized and characterized. The positions and the additional fusion of benzene rings (colored in the figure) considerably changed the molecular structures, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the photoluminescence properties.







Abstract
Dibenzo[b,g]phosphindolizine oxide and three types of benzo[e]naphthophosphindolizine oxides have been synthesized by the ring&#8208;closing metathesis of benzo[b]phosphole oxide and naphthophosphole oxides with two olefin tethers. Their molecular structures and properties were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis. The number and position of the benzene rings were found to alter the structural geometry and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and their effects were investigated by theoretical calculations. Among the phosphindolizine oxide derivatives investigated, only benzo[e]naphtho[2,3&#8208;b]phosphindolizine oxide with the naphthalene ring fused at 2,3&#8208;positions showed weak yellow fluorescence with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Stable Arylfluorene&#8208;Based Radical&#8208;Type Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorene&#8208;based radical&#8208;type mechanophores with various electron densities have been investigated. The thermal stability and tolerance for peroxidation of the sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon radicals increased with decreasing electron density of the fluorene moiety. DFT calculations revealed that the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species are of crucial importance for the thermal stability and susceptibility toward peroxidation. A triazylfluorene&#8208;based radical&#8208;type mechanophore showed high stability toward oxidation and mechanochromic behavior when incorporated in polymer chains.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;type mechanophores (RMs) can undergo homolytic cleavage of their central C&#8722;C bonds upon exposure to mechanical forces, which affords radical species. Understanding the characteristics of these radical species allows bespoke mechanoresponsive materials to be designed and developed. The thermal stability of the central C&#8722;C bonds and the oxygen tolerance of the generated radical species are crucial characteristics that determine the functions and applicability of such RM&#8208;containing mechanoresponsive materials. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of two series of arylfluorene&#8208;based RM derivatives, that is, 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BPyF) and 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;triazyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BTAF). BPyF and BTAF derivatives were synthesized without generating any peroxides initially, albeit that BPyF slowly converted to the corresponding peroxide in solution. DFT calculations revealed the importance of the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species for their thermal stability and oxygen tolerance.

     alt="Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Stable Arylfluorene-Based Radical-Type Mechanophores"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluorene-based radical-type mechanophores&lt;/b&gt; with various electron densities have been investigated. The thermal stability and tolerance for peroxidation of the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized carbon radicals increased with decreasing electron density of the fluorene moiety. DFT calculations revealed that the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;-SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species are of crucial importance for the thermal stability and susceptibility toward peroxidation. A triazylfluorene-based radical-type mechanophore showed high stability toward oxidation and mechanochromic behavior when incorporated in polymer chains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical-type mechanophores (RMs) can undergo homolytic cleavage of their central C&#8722;C bonds upon exposure to mechanical forces, which affords radical species. Understanding the characteristics of these radical species allows bespoke mechanoresponsive materials to be designed and developed. The thermal stability of the central C&#8722;C bonds and the oxygen tolerance of the generated radical species are crucial characteristics that determine the functions and applicability of such RM-containing mechanoresponsive materials. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of two series of arylfluorene-based RM derivatives, that is, 9,9&#8217;-bis(5-methyl-2-pyridyl)-9,9&#8217;-bifluorene (BPyF) and 9,9&#8217;-bis(4,6-diphenyl-2-triazyl)-9,9&#8217;-bifluorene (BTAF). BPyF and BTAF derivatives were synthesized without generating any peroxides initially, albeit that BPyF slowly converted to the corresponding peroxide in solution. DFT calculations revealed the importance of the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;-SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species for their thermal stability and oxygen tolerance. Furthermore, the mechanochromism of BTAF was demonstrated by ball-milling a BTAF-centered polymer, which was synthesized by atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage in Lignin via Co Nanoparticles Embedded in 3DNG as Catalyst

Cobalt nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene exhibited high catalytic activity for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin under moderate condition without any additive.







Abstract
The cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin is one of the key steps for oxidative conversion of lignin to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight aromatics. Herein, Co nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X) were prepared through an immersion&#8208;pyrolysis procedure, in which X denotes the pyrolysis temperature. The detailed characterization of Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X shows that the Co nanoparticles are coated with a few layers of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) sheets that are further embedded in 3DNG matrix. The catalytic activities of the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X for the oxidative cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin model compounds with O2 as oxidant are explored. It is demonstrated that catalytic activities of as&#8208;prepared Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X can be tuned by varying the pyrolysis condition, and the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 shows the highest catalytic activity, which is attributed to the enriched Co&#8208;Nx species, the strong surface basicity, the high specific surface and the mesoporous motif of 3DNG network. More pronouncedly, the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 can also effectively catalyze the oxidative cleavage of organosolv lignin, generating certain monomeric aromatics. Additionally, the intrinsic magnetic property of Co nanoparticles makes the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X be easily recovered from the reaction mixture, and the as&#8208;coated thin NG layer can protect Co nanoparticle from oxidation condition, which putting together afford the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X with good reusability and stability.

&lt;p&gt;The cleavage of &#946;-O-4 linkage in lignin is one of the key steps for oxidative conversion of lignin to low-molecular-weight aromatics.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete, Homochiral FeII2L3 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination chemistry is a powerful method to synthesize supramolecular cages with distinct features that suit specific applications. This work demonstrates the synthesis of discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages via chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, the installation of chirality&#8212;at both the vertices and ligand backbones&#8212;allows the formation of discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages of different sizes via stereochemical control of the iron(II) centers. We observed that larger cages require multiple chiral centra (chiral ligands and vertices). In contrast, the formation of smaller cages is stereoselective with solely chiral ligands. The latter cages can also be formed from two chiral subcomponents, but only when they oppose matching chirality. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of these smaller FeII2L3 cages revealed several non&#8208;covalent interactions known as a driving force for narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. This expected behavior was confirmed utilizing the shorter ligands in racemic form, yielding discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages in enantiomeric pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Intermediates in the Reaction Pathway of SO2 on the CaO surface: From Physisorption to Sulfite to Sulfate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction of CaO and Ca(OH)2 with solvated or gaseous SO2 plays a crucial role in the corrosion of urban infrastructure by acid rain or in the removal of SO2 from flue gas. We carried out a combined spectroscopic and theoretical investigation on the interaction of SO2 with a CaO(001) single crystal. First, the surface chemistry of SO2 was investigated at different temperatures using polarization&#8208;resolved IR reflection absorption spectroscopy. Three species were identified, and an in&#8208;depth density functional theory study was carried out, which allowed deriving a consistent picture. Unexpectedly, low temperature exposure to SO2 solely yields a physisorbed species. Only above 100 K, the transformation of this weakly bound adsorbate first to a chemisorbed sulfite and then to a sulfate occurs, effectively passivating the surface. Our results provide the basis for more efficient strategies in corrosion protection of urban infrastructure and in lime&#8208;based desulfurization of flue gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Modulation of the Structures and Magnetic Relaxation in Triangular Dy3 Complexes Based on a Tricompartmental Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a novel tricompartmental hydrazone ligand, a set of trinuclear Dy3 complexes has been isolated and structurally characterized. Complexes Dy3&#183;Cl, Dy3&#183;Br, and Dy3&#183;ClO4 feature a similar overall topology but different anions (Cl&#8210;, Br&#8210;, or ClO4&#8210;) in combination with exogenous OH&#8210; and solvent co&#8208;ligands, which is found to translate into very different magnetic properties. Complex Dy3&#183;Cl shows a double relaxation process with fast quantum tunneling of the magnetization, probably related to the structural disorder of &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8210; and &#956;2&#8208;Cl&#8210; co&#8208;ligands. Relaxation of the magnetization is slowed down for Dy3&#183;Br and Dy3&#183;ClO4, which do not show any structural disorder. In particular, fast quantum tunneling is suppressed in case of Dy3&#183;ClO4, resulting in an energy barrier of 341 K and magnetic hysteresis up to 3.5 K; this makes Dy3&#183;ClO4 one of the most robust air&#8208;stable trinuclear SMMs. Magneto&#8208;structural relationships of the three complexes are analyzed and rationalized with the help of CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Ligands for Histological Multiplex Spectral Detection of Distinct Protein Aggregates in Alzheimer&#180;s Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation and accumulation of proteins in the brain is the defining feature of many devastating neurodegenerative diseases. The development of fluorescent ligands that bind to these accumulations, or deposits, is essential for the characterization of these neuropathological lesions. We report the synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) thiophene&#8208;based ligands with different emission properties. The D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands displayed selectivity towards distinct disease&#8208;associated protein deposits in histological sections from postmortem brain tissue of individuals affected by Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). The ability of the ligands to selectively identify AD&#8208;associated pathological alterations, such as deposits composed of aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau, was reduced when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. When combining the D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands with conventional thiophene&#8208;based ligands, superior spectral separation of distinct protein aggregates in AD tissue sections was obtained. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species, as well as offer novel strategies for developing multiplex fluorescence detection of protein aggregates in tissue sections.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugating Coumarin with Tetraphenylethylene to Achieve Dual&#8208;State Emission for Reversible Mechanofluorochromism and Live Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;state emission luminogens (DSEgens) are receiving research interest in the construction of multifunctional materials due to their inherent advantage of high emission efficiency in both the molecularly dispersed solution state and the solid state. However, it remains challenging in synthesizing DSEgens via a delicate manipulation of the molecular structures. This work presents an example of synthesizing bright DSEgens by tuning the molecular electronic structures and conformations. Three coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene (TPE) molecules with a donor&#8208;acceptor electronic structure and highly twisting conformations have been synthesized. While compound resulting from direct conjugation of coumarin with a TPE unit shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission, compound with an N,N&#8208;diaminoethyl modification on the 7&#8208;position of coumarin and compound with a further phenyl linker between coumarin and TPE units feature strong dual&#8208;state emission. Benefiting from their strong solid emission and twisting conformation, these fluorophores display reversible mechanofluorochromism. Finally, applications for rewritable information storage in the solid state and live&#8208;cell imaging in the solution state were demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>{V6} Ring Sandwiched Polyoxoniobate as Molecular Electrocatalyst for Oxidant&#8208;Free Synthesis of Sulfoxides Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules to value&#8208;added chemicals has attracted recent attention. Although a series of transition metal based electrocatalytic materials have been developed, the lack of precise structure information generates great challenges in understanding the catalytic mechanism at a molecular level. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a molecular electrocatalyst, Na2K6H14[(VO)6(&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33)2]&#183;31H2O&#183;2.5C2H8N2 (abbreviated as V6(TeNb9)2), where a reduced {V6} ring is sandwiched by two trivacant Keggin&#8208;type {&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33}. V6(TeNb9)2 as heterogeneous electrocatalyst can selectively convert 95% of thioanisole to sulfoxide with the Faraday efficiency up to 98%. Notably, the important role of the embedded {V6} ring in the electrocatalytic oxidation was illustrated by comparing with {Nb6} ring sandwiched catalyst, Na5K7H4[(NbO)6(&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33)2]&#183;17H2O (abbreviated as Nb6(TeNb9)2). Mechanism studies reveal that during the electrocatalytic oxidation process water is the only oxygen source and a key intermediate PhCH3S+&#8226; is involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dione: A Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Unit with Organic Semiconductor Characteristics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of electron&#8208;accepting units is of significant importance because the construction of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) configurations is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic properties of p&#8208;conjugated systems. Although double fused pentagons represented by diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been utilized as an effective electron&#8208;accepting unit, the relatively high&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels (FMOs) leave room for further improvement. We report herein on the synthesis of a fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) derivative as a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit and prepared D&#8208;A&#8208;D p&#8208;extended molecules. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed that the presence of fluorine atoms contributed to the formation of high planar structures and slipped&#8208;stacked packing. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the FPD derivatives showed relatively lower FMO energy levels compared to those of the corresponding DPP&#8208;containing derivatives. The D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecule based on terthiophene and FPD showed semiconducting responses. This study demonstrates that the FPD unit can function as a new acceptor unit for organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Responsive Molecular Receptor to Modulate Atropisomerism and Cation Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable anthranyl receptors controlled by 1O2 show a different preorganization of the binding sites induced by two combined effects: the structural modification and the on/off mode for the host atropisomerism.







Abstract
In switchable molecular recognition, 1O2 stimulus responsive receptors offer a unique structural change that is rarely exploited. The employed [4+2] reaction between 1O2 and anthracene derivatives is quantitative, reversible and easily implemented. To evaluate the full potential of this new stimulus, a non&#8208;macrocyclic anthracene&#8208;based host was designed for the modular binding of cations. The structural investigation showed that 1O2 controlled the atropisomerism in an on/off fashion within the pair of hosts. The binding studies revealed higher association constants for the endoperoxide receptor compared to the parent anthracene, due to a more favoured preorganization of the recognition site. The fatigue of the 1O2 switchable hosts and their complexes was monitored over five cycles of cycloaddition/cycloreversion.

         <title>Concertedness and Activation Energy Control by Distal Methyl Group during Ring Contraction/Expansion in Scalarane&#8208;Type Sesterterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations revealed that the distal methyl group controls both concertedness and energy barrier during the skeletal rearrangement reaction involved in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, the unique skeletal rearrangement&#8216;s protonation process, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity were elucidated.







Abstract
Salmahyritisol A, similan A, and hippospongide A, which are scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoids, feature 6/6/5/7/5 pentacyclic skeletons. Although their biosyntheses have been previously proposed to involve a unique skeletal rearrangement reaction, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear as none of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes for this reaction have been reported. Herein, this skeletal rearrangement reaction was investigated using computational techniques, which revealed the following four key features: (i) the distal 24&#8208;Me substituent controls both the concertedness and activation energy of this transformation, (ii) enzymes are not responsible for the observed regioselectivity of C12&#8722;C20 bond formation, (iii) stereoselectivity is enzyme&#8208;regulated, and (iv) protonation is a key step in this skeletal rearrangement process. These new findings provide insight into the C&#8208;ring&#8208;contraction and D&#8208;ring&#8208;expansion mechanisms in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosyntheses.

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF Based Ratiometric Luminescent Sensor for the Detection of Potential COVID&#8208;19 Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescence detection is a fast and convenient method to quantify and control the drug amount in body fluids. Here, we present a new mixed lanthanide&#8208;based MOF that can selectively distinguish and monitor the amount of favipiravir among other potential COVID&#8208;19 drugs.







Abstract
Countless people have been affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic on a global scale. Favipiravir, has shown potential as an effective drug for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, attracting scientists&#8217; attention. However, overuse of Favipiravir easily leads to serious side effects, requiring real&#8208;time monitoring in body fluids. Given this, a new lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was prepared under solvothermal conditions from either Eu (Eu&#8208;MOF or (1)) or Tb (Tb&#8208;MOF or (2)) using the highly delocalized imidazoledicarboxylic acid linker H2L (H2L=5&#8208;(4&#8208;(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) phenyl) isophthalic acid) and could be successfully applied to selective optical detection of Favipiravir. In this MOF framework, the organic linker H2L provides a high excitation energy transfer efficiency that can sensitize luminescence in lanthanides. In addition, through deliberate tuning of Eu/Tb molar ratio and reaction concentration in the lanthanide framework, ratiometric recyclable luminescent EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;MOF nanoparticles with open metal sites have been constructed, which present a high detection sensitivity (Ksv=1&#215;107 [M&#8722;1], detection limit is 4.63&#8197;nM) for Favipiravir. The detection mechanism is discussed with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that sheds light over the selective sensing of Favipiravir over other related COVID&#8208;19 drug candidates. Finally, to explore the practical application of Favipiravir sensing, MOF based thin films have been used for visual detection of Favipiravir and recycled 5 times.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Tuning the Properties of Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic CRRiteria: This review summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR). It provides advanced knowledge on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR, serving as a general guide to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.







Abstract
Suppressing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an essential measure toward addressing global warming. Specifically, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. However, the practical application of photocatalyst&#8208;promoting CRR (CRR photocatalysts) requires significant improvement of their conversion efficiency. Accordingly, extensive research is being conducted toward improving semiconductor photocatalysts, as well as cocatalysts that are loaded as active sites on the photocatalysts. In this review, we summarize recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. We expect that the advanced knowledge provided on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR in this review will serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>Unveiling the Collaborative Effect at the Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;MoS2 Hybrid Interface for Electrochemical Melatonin Determination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption geometry of cucurbit[8]uril on a 2D nanoplatform controls the recognition capabilities. It behaves like a traffic light: on a transition metal dichalcogenide, the reception portals of CB[8] are open and the guest molecule can fit in. On graphene (or carbonaceous termination) they are closed, which prevents complex formation.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest interactions are of paramount importance in supramolecular chemistry and in a wide range of applications. Particularly well known is the ability of cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) to selectively host small molecules. We show that the charge transfer and complexation capabilities of CB[n] are retained on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), allowing the development of efficient electrochemical sensing platforms. We unveil the mechanisms of host&#8208;guest recognition between the MoS2&#8208;CB[8] hybrid interface and melatonin (MLT), an important molecular regulator of vital constants in vertebrates. We find that CB[8] on MoS2 organizes the receptor portals perpendicularly to the surface, facilitating MLT complexation. This advantageous adsorption geometry is specific to TMDs and favours MLT electro&#8208;oxidation, as opposed to other 2D platforms like graphene, where one receptor portal is closed. This study rationalises the cooperative interaction in 2D hybrid systems to improve the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical sensing platforms.

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cooperativity in the Catalytic Activity of Phosphodiester Cleavage by Self&#8208;Assembled Systems Based on Guanidinylated Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled enzyme mimic. Calix[4]arenes, provided with long alkyl chains and guanidine units, perform spontaneous aggregation driven by hydrophobic effect. A pronounced superiority of the phosphodiesterase activity of the assembled structures compared with the monomers indicates intermolecular cooperation of the active units through a dynamic preorganization.







Abstract
The calix[4]arene scaffold, blocked in the cone conformation through alkylation with long alkyl chains, and decorated at the upper rim with four guanidine or arginine units, effectively catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA and RNA model compounds in water. An exhaustive kinetic investigation unequivocally points to the existence of spontaneous aggregation phenomena, driven by hydrophobic effect, occurring at different critical concentrations that depend on the identity of the compound. A pronounced superiority of the assembled structures compared with the monomers in solution was observed. Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering. The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favors phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.

         <title>Access to Amide&#8208;linked Organic Cages by in situ Trapping of Metastable Imine Assemblies: Solution Phase Bisamine Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular cages are sought after as receptors and catalysts. However, typical dynamic covalent chemistry approaches restrict the shape&#8208;persistence, solubility and stability of self&#8208;assembled organic cages. As a result, organic cages occupy a narrow chemical and functional space, and solution&#8208;phase applications and studies remain rare. We report an in situ trapping protocol, using Pinnick oxidation conditions, to convert soluble metastable imine assemblies to robust amide cages, and exemplify the method to access previously inaccessible organic cages. The new cages are internally functionalised with two constrained and diametrically opposed carboxylic acid groups that can distinguish between functionalised piperazines in THF. We anticipate our approach will broaden access to robust, soluble, self&#8208;assembled organic cages of an unsymmetrical or semi&#8208;flexible nature, which in turn will drive advances in solution&#8208;phase applications of molecular cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective Decarboxylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the rapid growth of electrophotocatalysis in recent years, enantioselective catalytic reactions powered by this unique methodology remain rare. In this work, we report an electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for direct asymmetric decarboxylative cyanation of aliphatic carboxylic acids. The synergistic merging of electrophotochemical cerium catalysis and asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis permits mild reaction conditions for the formation and utilization of the key carbon centered radicals by combining the power of light and electrical energy. Electrophotochemical cerium catalysis enables radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis for the construction of C&#8211;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective fashion. This environmentally benign method smoothly converts a diverse array of arylacetic acids into the corresponding alkyl nitriles in good yields and enantioselectivities without using chemical oxidants or pre&#8208;functionalization of the acid substrates and can be readily scaled up.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;promoted Carbon&#8208;silicon Solid Acid Catalysts for the Synthesis and Process Optimization of Benzaldehyde Glycol Acetal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of transition metal (M)&#8208;promoted carbon&#8208;silicon (C&#8208;M&#8208;Si; M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr) solid acid catalysts with designated molar ratio of M/Si = 1:8 were fabricated and exploited for acetalization of benzaldehyde (BzH) with ethylene glycol (EG). The physical and chemical properties of these C&#8208;M&#8208;Si catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;gel method were characterized by various techniques, namely, SEM, EDS, TGA&#8208;DTG, BET, XRD, FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and NH3&#8208;TPD. Among various examined acidic C&#8208;M&#8208;Si catalysts, the C&#8208;Fe&#8208;Si catalyst exhibited the optimal catalytic activity with the benzaldehyde glycol acetal (BEGA) yield of 97.67%, in excellent agreement with the value (97.88%) predicted by the response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box&#8208;Behnken design (BBD). C&#8208;Fe&#8208;Si catalyst with the high catalytic activities and excellent stability and reusability may be ascribed to the suitable acidity and uniform surface distribution of active sites requisite for the acid&#8208;catalyzed acetalization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of NIR&#8208;Absorbing Ability of Bis(diarylmethylium)&#8208;Type Dicationic Dyes Based on an Ortho&#8208;Substitution Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochromic systems capable of switching near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are fascinating from the viewpoint of applications in the materials and life sciences. Although 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethanes (AQDs) with a folded form undergo one&#8208;stage two&#8208;electron oxidation to produce twisted dicationic dyes exhibiting NIR absorption, there is a need to establish a design strategy that can enhance the NIR&#8208;absorbing abilities of the corresponding dicationic dyes. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of anthraquinodimethane derivatives with various substituents introduced at the ortho&#8208;position(s) of the 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl group. X&#8208;ray and spectroscopic analyses revealed that NIR&#8208;absorbing properties can be changed by introduction of the ortho substituents. Thus, control of the steric and electronic effects of the ortho substituents on the 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups was demonstrated to be an effective strategy for fine&#8208;tuning of the HOMO and LUMO levels for neutral AQDs and twisted dications, respectively, resulting in the modification of electrochemical and spectroscopic properties under an &#8220;ortho&#8208;substitution strategy&#8221;.</dc:description>

The ligands L1&#8722; and L2&#8722; differed with respect to the para&#8208;quinone versus phenazine moieties linked to the azo function.

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow in Fluoranthene&#8208;Containing Dopant&#8208;Matrix Systems: From Conventional Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence to Efficient Red TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to fabricate highly&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;lived organic afterglow materials, especially in the case of red afterglow systems. Here we develop advanced charge transfer (CT) technology to boost afterglow efficiency and lifetimes in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. First, organic CT molecules possess singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) of around 0.5 eV, much smaller than localized excitation systems. Second, upon doping into suitable organic matrices, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between 1CT states and organic matrices reduce 1CT levels with less effect on 3CT levels, and thus further narrow &#916;EST and enhance intersystem crossing. Third, the rigid planar structure of fluoranthene groups and the rigid microenvironment provided by organic matrices can suppress phosphorescence quenching. Forth, the multiple donor design enables spectral red&#8208;shifts to red region and switches on TADF mechanism to improve afterglow efficiency to 13.1% and maintain afterglow lifetime of 0.1 s. Such high&#8208;performance afterglow materials have been rarely explored in reported studies.</dc:description>

Here we develop advanced charge transfer (CT) technology to boost afterglow efficiency and lifetimes in fluoranthene-containing dopant-matrix systems. First, organic CT molecules possess singlet-triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) of around 0.5 eV, much smaller than localized excitation systems. Second, upon doping into suitable organic matrices, dipole-dipole interactions between 1CT states and organic matrices reduce 1CT levels with less effect on 3CT levels, and thus further narrow &#916;EST and enhance intersystem crossing. Third, the rigid planar structure of fluoranthene groups and the rigid microenvironment provided by organic matrices can suppress phosphorescence quenching. Forth, the multiple donor design enables spectral red-shifts to red region and switches on TADF mechanism to improve afterglow efficiency to 13.1% and maintain afterglow lifetime of 0.1 s. Such high-performance afterglow materials have been rarely explored in reported studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A dimeric ZnII carbene complex featuring bridging and chelating benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiolate ligands is highly stable towards air and water. The donor&#8208;Zn&#8208;acceptor structure leads to visible light emission in the solid state, solution and polymer matrices with &#955;max between 577&#8208;657 nm and, for zinc(II) complexes, unusually high radiative rate constants for triplet exciton decay of up to kr = 1.5&#215;105 s&#8208;1 at room temperature. Variable temperature and DFT/MRCI studies show that a small energy gap between the 1/3LL/LMCT states of only 79 meV is responsible for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).

         <title>Hybrid Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Structures and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply HOF! This work reviewed the recent development progress of hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), including ionic HOFs and metallized HOFs. The rational design synthesis principles of stable, porous, and functional hybrid HOFs by using charged or metallized building blocks are discussed. Their front applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, and catalysis are highlighted.







Abstract
As a new class of porous crystalline materials, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from building blocks by hydrogen bonds have gained increasing attention. HOFs benefit from advantages including mild synthesis, easy purification, and good recyclability. However, some HOFs transform into unstable frameworks after desolvation, which hinders their further applications. Nowadays, the main challenges of developing HOFs lie in stability improvement, porosity establishment, and functionalization. Recently, more and more stable and permanently porous HOFs have been reported. Of all these design strategies, stronger charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds have been proven to be effective for developing stable, porous, and functional solids called hybrid HOFs, including ionic and metallized HOFs. This Review discusses the rational design synthesis principles of hybrid HOFs and their cutting&#8208;edge applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, catalysis and so forth.

         <title>Clearing an ESKAPE Pathogen in a Model Organism; A Polypyridyl Ruthenium(II) Complex Theranostic that Treats a Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infection in Galleria mellonella</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear polypyridyl RuII complex is highly active against the ESKAPE pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With a single dose it can be used to both directly monitor, and completely clear, infections caused by an AMR strain of A baumannii that proves to be highly virulent in the Galleria mellonella larva model when left untreated.







Abstract
In previous studies we have described the therapeutic action of luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes based on the tetrapyridylphenazine, tpphz, bridging ligand on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Herein, the antimicrobial activity of the complex against pernicious Gram&#8208;negative ESKAPE pathogenic strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB12, AB16, AB184 and AB210) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA2017, PA_ 007_ IMP and PA_ 004_ CRCN) are reported. Estimated minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the complexes revealed the complex shows potent activity against all A. baumannii strains, in both glucose defined minimal media and standard nutrient rich Mueller&#8208;Hinton&#8208;II. Although the activity was lower in P. aureginosa, a moderately high potency was observed and retained in carbapenem&#8208;resistant strains. Optical microscopy showed that the compound is rapidly internalized by A. baumannii. As previous reports had revealed the complex exhibited no toxicity in Galleria Mellonella up to concentrations of 80&#8197;mg/kg, the ability to clear pathogenic infection within this model was explored. The pathogenic concentrations to the larvae for each bacterium were determined to be&#8805;105 for AB184 and&#8805;103 CFU/mL for PA2017. It was found a single dose of the compound totally cleared a pathogenic A. baumannii infection from all treated G. mellonella within 96&#8197;h. Uniquely, in these conditions thanks to the imaging properties of the complex the clearance of the bacteria within the hemolymph of G. mellonella could be directly visualized through both optical and transmission electron microscopy.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Clickable Unnatural Sugars in the Unprotected and 1,6&#8208;Di&#8208;O&#8208;Acylated Forms for Metabolic Glycan Labeling</title>

         <dc:description>
Per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural sugars have been widely used in metabolic glycan labeling (MGL), but they can induce non&#8208;enzymatic S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Here we develop facile synthetic routes for unprotected clickable unnatural sugars and their 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated counterparts at the ten&#8208;gram scale, the latter enables MGL with high efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification







Abstract
Clickable unnatural sugars have been widely used in studying glycosylation in living systems via the metabolic glycan labelling (MGL) strategy. Partial protection of unnatural sugars by 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylation increases the labelling efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of clickable unnatural sugars in both the unprotected and 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated forms at the ten&#8208;gram scale. By evaluation of the labelling specificity, efficiency, and biocompatibility of various 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated sugars for MGL in cell lines and living mice, we demonstrate that 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;propionylated unnatural sugars are optimal chemical reporters for glycan labelling. The synthetic routes developed in this work should facilitate the widespread use of MGL with no artificial S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification for investigating the functional roles of glycans.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Lipidation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Fusion Peptide Reinstates Superior Membrane Fusion Catalytic Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making a link: C&#8208;Terminal myristoylation of fusion peptide restores the fusion&#8208;catalytic role of fusion peptide (FP). The lipid linker might restrict the localization of the C&#8197;terminus of the FP at the interface, assist the free dive of the N&#8197;terminus of the fusion peptide to the membrane, and bridge the viral membrane and host membrane through plasticity to promote the fusion.







Abstract
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;associated coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) mediates a critical stage in infection, the fusion between viral and host membranes. The protein is categorized as a class&#8197;I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we modified the C&#8197;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) to restrict the C&#8197;terminus near to the interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;sFP) and truncated peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;8FP) could not significantly catalyze the fusion, thus suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8197;terminus. C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP enhances murine coronavirus infection by promoting syncytia formation in L2 cells. The C&#8208;terminal lipidation of the FP might be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making a link&lt;/b&gt;: C-Terminal myristoylation of fusion peptide restores the fusion-catalytic role of fusion peptide (FP). The lipid linker might restrict the localization of the C&#8197;terminus of the FP at the interface, assist the free dive of the N&#8197;terminus of the fusion peptide to the membrane, and bridge the viral membrane and host membrane through plasticity to promote the fusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates a critical stage in infection, the fusion between viral and host membranes. The protein is categorized as a class&#8197;I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we modified the C&#8197;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C-myr-FP) to restrict the C&#8197;terminus near to the interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C-myr-FP) of SARS-CoV-2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C-myr-FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C-myr-sFP) and truncated peptide (C-myr-8FP) could not significantly catalyze the fusion, thus suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8197;terminus. C-myr-FP enhances murine coronavirus infection by promoting syncytia formation in L2 cells. The C-terminal lipidation of the FP might be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tweaking the Optoelectronic Properties of S&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Chemical Oxidation</title>

Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene is used as a functional scaffold to engineer a molecular semiconductor, the properties of which can be tailored by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Oxidation with H2O2 led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation yields sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence complexes.







Abstract
Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S&#8208;doped analog of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2 led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid&#8208;state arrangements with face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S&#8208;atoms, with the bis&#8208;sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00=2.99&#8197;eV). While peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their n&#8208;type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10&#8722;1&#8211;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 10&#8722;2&#8211;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far. Finally, the electroluminescence properties of the complexes were tested in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), obtaining the first S&#8208;doped mid&#8208;emitting PAH&#8208;based LECs.

         <title>Emission and Luminescent Vapochromism Control of Octahedral Cu4I4 Complexes by Conformationally Restricted P,N Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of two conformers with &#8220;compact&#8221; and &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of Cu4I4 demonstrating green and red emissions was established for the octahedral L2Cu4I4 complex with the conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand. Stretching of the Cu4I4 core provides the drastic change of the emission and might be a reason for the dual emission of the Cu4I4 octahedral complexes.







Abstract
A conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand capable of the design of polynuclear copper(I) complexes was synthesized via the reaction of primary pyridylphosphine, paraformaldehyde, and benzhydrylamine. The reaction of the ligand with copper(I) iodide leads to the tetranuclear copper(I) complex with the octahedral type of copper&#8208;iodide core. Different orientation of coordination bonds of the ligands relative to the P,N2&#8208;heterocyclic fragments and to the Cu4I4 cores leads to the existence of two types of conformers of the complex with &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of the Cu4I4 cluster. This lability of the complex allowed for obtaining two crystalline phases displaying green or red luminescence. The TDDFT computations along with XRD structural analysis gave a strong interpretation of the green emission belonging to the &#8220;compact&#8221; form of the complex and belonging of the red emission to the &#8220;stretched&#8221; form. Moreover, both crystalline phases demonstrate the strong vapochromic responses of luminescence on the vapors of wide range of solvents.

meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin was synthesized in 63&#8201;% yield by TsOH&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromotripyrrin. Treatment of [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA gave a stable neutral radical, which was oxidized to stable [20]smaragdyrin antiaromatic cationwith AgSbF6. Reduction of the neutral radical with NaBH4 gave aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was readily oxidized to the neutral radical and converted to thermodynamically stable [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex upon treatment with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA. Similarly, [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex was oxidized to stable neutral radical and antiaromatic cation in a stepwise manner. As such, smaragdyrin BF2 complexes have been shown to be very intriguing, allowing for various electronic states including stable radicals and cations.







Abstract
meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin freebase was synthesized by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromodipyrrin in an improved yield of 63&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, treatment of the [20]smaragdyrin freebase with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and triethylamine (TEA) gave a stable radical species, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the tripyrrin site, probably by ready release of a hydrogen atom of a [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex. Similar treatment of [22]smaragdyrin free base produced another [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the dipyrrin site. The tripyrrin site coordinated neutral radical was oxidized with AgSbF6 to give a stable antiaromatic cation; this was reduced with NaBH4 to its 22&#960; congener, which was easily oxidized back to the neutral radical in the air and rearranged to thermodynamically stable dipyrrin site coordinated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex upon treatment with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA. Further, the dipyrrin site coordinated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex was similarly oxidized to a stable neutral radical and a stable cation in a stepwise manner. This work demonstrates a rare ability of smaragdyrin BF2 complexes to exist in multiple redox states, particularly forming a stable neutral radical by facile release of a hydrogen atom.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding of an NIR Emitting Osmium Polypyridyl Probe Revealed by Solution NMR and Time&#8208;Resolved Infrared Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent enhancement of an enantiopure Os polypyridyl probe containing an extended dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz) ligand in the presence of human telomer (hTel) and cMYC guanine quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) is reported. NMR studies indicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at the 5&#8217;&#8208;quartet end, which is supported by time&#8208;resolved infrared measurements. Importantly, the combined measurements indicate the sensitivity of luminescent enhancement to the particular orientation at the 5&#8217;&#8208;quartet binding site.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes are emerging targets in cancer research and understanding how diagnostic probes bind to DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in solution is critical to the development of new molecular tools. In this study the binding of an enantiopure NIR emitting [Os(TAP)2(dppz)]2+ complex to different G&#8208;quadruplex structures formed by human telomer (hTel) and cMYC sequences in solution is reported. The combination of NMR and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques reveals the sensitivity of the emission response to subtle changes in the binding environment of the complex. Similar behaviour is also observed for the related complex [Os(TAP)2(dppp2)]2+ upon quadruplex binding.

         <title>Cooperative Photochemical Reaction Kinetics in Organic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In organic molecular crystals, many photoreactions do not obey simple kinetic models, but instead follow nucleation&#8208;growth kinetics. This kind of reaction is often called a cooperative reaction because the reaction of an individual molecule is facilitated (or inhibited) by its neighbors.







Abstract
Photoreactive molecular crystals have been intensively investigated as next&#8208;generation functional materials. Changes in physicochemical properties are usually interpreted in terms of static pre&#8208; and post&#8208;reaction molecular structures and packings determined by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. However, to elucidate the dynamic properties, it is necessary to understand the dynamic nature of photochemical kinetics in crystals. Reaction dynamics in the crystal phase can be dramatically different from those in dilute solution because the local molecular environment evolves as the surrounding reactant molecules are transformed into products. In this Review article, we summarize multiple examples of photochemical reactions in the crystalline phase that do not follow classical kinetic behavior. We also discuss different theoretical methods that can be used to describe this behavior. This Review article should help provide a foundation for future workers to understand and analyze photochemical reaction kinetics in crystals.

         <title>Gated, Selective Anion Exchange in Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. The external groups act as a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing ligand rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate. Bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.







Abstract
Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. While the unfunctionalized cages contain aryl groups in the ligand that can freely rotate, attaching inert functional groups creates a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate, even though the interiors of the host cavities are identically structured. The effects on anion exchange are subtle and depend on multiple factors, including anion size, the nature of the leaving anion, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and steric bulk of the pendant groups. Multiple exchange mechanisms occur, and the nature of the external groups controls associative and dissociative exchange processes: these bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.

         <title>N&#8208;Fluoroalkylated Morpholinos &#8211; a New Class of Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholino nucleoside derivatives is reported. The procedures were based either on a double reductive amination&#8208;cyclisation reaction, using commercially available mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoralkylated amines, or on post&#8208;cyclisation trifluoromethylation of the morpholino nitrogen, by oxidative desulfurization&#8208;fluorination with NBS and diethylaminosulfur trifluoride.







Abstract
The first concise and efficient synthesis of some fluorine&#8208;containing morpholino nucleosides has been developed. One synthetic strategy was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of the vicinal diol unit of uridine, cytidine adenosine and guanosine derivatives, followed by cyclisation of the dialdehyde intermediates by double reductive amination with fluorinated primary amines to obtain various N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholinos. Another approach involved cyclisation of the diformyl intermediates with ammonia source, followed by dithiocarbamate formation and desulfurization&#8208;fluorination with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride yielding the corresponding morpholine&#8208;based nucleoside analogues with a N&#8208;CF3 element in their structure.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanoassemblies in Water Exhibiting Tunable LCST Behavior and Responsive Light Harvesting Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic monomer, CSO, was synthesized which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core flanked by two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) tails. The CSO molecule can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in water with blue fluorescence and LCST behavior. These nanoassemblies also exhibit thermo&#8208;responsive fluorescence and were further used to construct a responsive light harvesting system.







Abstract
Responsive fluorescent nanomaterials have been received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, a bola&#8208;type amphiphilic molecule, CSO, was synthesized which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core and hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) coils at both sides. The cyanostilbene group is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active, while the OEG coils are thermo&#8208;responsive. As a result, the CSO molecules can self&#8208;assemble into blue&#8208;fluorescent nanoassemblies with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in aqueous media. It is noteworthy that the LCST behavior can be reversibly regulated with changes in concentration and the introduction of K+. Intriguingly, fluorescence of CSO assembly shows a blue&#8208;shift upon heating. Finally, by employing CSO as a light capturing antenna and energy donor, an artificial light harvesting system with tunable emission and thermo&#8208;responsive characteristics was fabricated. This study not only demonstrates an integrated approach to create responsive fluorescent nanomaterials, but also shows great potential for producing luminescent materials and mimicking photosynthesis in nature.

         <title>AuNP&#8208;Modulated qPCR: An Optimized System for Detecting MIR Biophotons Released in DNA Replication
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living systems utilize energy with a high efficiency, but the mechanism remains unclear. Our detection based on an AuNP&#8208;modulated qPCR system shows that 33&#8208; and 84&#8208;THz photons are released by the hydrolysis of dNTP (an energy&#8208;storing molecule like ATP), which efficiently drives DNA replication. Our findings provide a novel method for detecting MIR photons, and pave a way for photon&#8208;based insights to understand the high&#8208;efficiency energy utilization of biology.







Abstract
Living systems can utilize energy with a high efficiency. Biophotons are proposed to modulate biological functions with such efficiency; however, the underlying mechanism remains unexplored, especially due to the challenge of ultraweak mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) light detection and the theoretical perturbation from spontaneous MIR emission. Here, we proposed an optimized system to detect MIR biophotons generated in the hydrolysis of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs, energy&#8208;storing molecules similar to ATP). The system used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) that was modulated by gold nanoparticle (AuNP) concentration and thus by the inter&#8208;AuNP distance, which depends on the concentration above. The measurements indicate that 33&#8208; and 84&#8208;THz photons are released by dNTP hydrolysis, which can drive DNA replication. Our findings provide a novel chain&#8208;reaction&#8208;based method for detecting MIR photons in solution, and pave a way for photon&#8208;based insights to understand the highly efficient energy utilization of biology.

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromaticity of charged expanded porphyrins turns out to be much more complex to study than that of their planar neutral analogues. In particular, identifying the most conjugated circuit is no longer straightforward. In addition to planarity, the protonation and deprotonation of porphyrinoids play an important role in determining their aromaticity. We have demonstrated that the largest charged porphyrins do not present a clear main conjugation pathway. Among the preferred aromatic indices, AVmin ends up being the most useful tool for recognizing the most aromatic path. We can relate the difficulty of finding the most conjugated path of a porphyrin to the number of pieces in a puzzle. Thus, the neutral state of the [36]octaphyrin is represented as a puzzle with few pieces; the protonated and deprotonated states are presented as puzzles with more pieces to indicate that they are more difficult to complete. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Torrent&#8208;Sucarrat, E. Matito, M. Alonso, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202264).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting effective non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we designed and fabricated Co nanoparticles confined in Mo/N co&#8208;doped polyhedral carbon frameworks (Co&#8208;NP/MNCF) derived from polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsuled metal&#8208;organic framework, which showed comparable ORR performance with commercial Pt/C and a larger diffusion&#8208;limited current density. Moreover, the Co&#8208;NP/MNCF also exhibited excellent ORR stability and methanol tolerance. These appealing performances can be attributed to the porosity regulation and heteroatom doping of MOF derived polyhedral carbon frameworks, which could be beneficial for the exposure of more active sites, the optimization of electronic structure and the mass transfer of electrolyte/electro/ion.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with a Binuclear Bis&#8208;Terpyridine Pyrazole&#8208;Bridged Cobalt Complex
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a binuclear cobalt complex stabilized by a new pyrazole&#8208;based ligand platform substituted with terpyridine groups. The dicobalt complex is electrocatalytically active towards carbon monoxide formation, from carbon dioxide in the presence of Bronsted acids. The terpyridine fragments participate during the electrocatalysis, reducing the overpotential of the reduction reaction.







Abstract
A pyrazole&#8208;based ligand substituted with terpyridine groups at the 3 and 5 positions has been synthesized to form the dinuclear cobalt complex 1, that electrocatalytically reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids in DMF. Chemical, electrochemical and UV&#8208;vis spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under inert atmosphere indicate pairwise reduction processes of complex 1. Infrared spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under CO2 and CO atmosphere are consistent with a reduced CO&#8208;containing dicobalt complex which results from the electroreduction of CO2. In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), electrocatalytic studies revealed single&#8208;site mechanism with up to 94&#8201;% selectivity towards CO formation when 1.47&#8197;M TFE were present, at &#8722;1.35&#8197;V vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode in DMF (0.39&#8197;V overpotential). The low faradaic efficiencies obtained (&lt;50&#8201;%) are attributed to the generation of CO&#8208;containing species formed during the electrocatalytic process, which inhibit the reduction of CO2.

         <dc:description>The cycloisomerization of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;benzoyloxycarbamates to 2&#8208;(3H)oxazolones is described. Two catalytic systems are tailored for intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;alkyne carboxyamidation and concomitant alkene isomerization. PtCl2/CO (5 mol%, toluene, 100 &#176;C) promotes both carboxyamidation and alkene isomerization but has a limited substrate scope. On the other hand, FeCl&#173;&#173;3 (5 mol%, CH3CN, 100 &#176;C) promotes carboxyamidation effectively but a cocatalyst is required for the exocyclic alkene isomerization. Thus, a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for a broader reaction scope, which involves FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation and base&#8208;induced alkene isomerization. Crossover experiments suggest that these reactions proceed mainly through a mechanism involving acylnitrenoid intermediates rather than carbenoid intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>[ReH3(PPh3)4] &#8208; A Key Compound in the Rhenium Hydride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of the rhenium trihydrido complex [ReH3(PPh3)4] (1) has been reinvestigated. An improved synthesis and the solid&#8208;state structure of the compound as well as several reactions are reported. The solid&#8208;state structure of 1 is similar to that of [TcH3(PPh3)4] having a capped&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere. The PPh3 ligands surround the Tc atom in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal mode with a short apical Re&#8208;P bond (2.300(2)&#160;&#197;) and three longer basal bonds (2.429(2)&#8208;2.449(2)&#160;&#197;). Reactions of 1 with monodentate phosphines such as PMe3 or PBu3 give the mono&#8208;substituted complexes [ReH3(PPh3)3(PMe3)] (2) and [ReH3(PPh3)3(PBu3)] (3) under retention of the apical PPh3 ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh3 ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh3&gt;PMe3&gt;PBu3. Treatment of [ReH3(PPh3)4] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH4(NCCH3)(PPh3)3]+ (4), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] (5). They are formed by an insertion of the nitrile into a Re&#8208;H bond. The solid&#8208;state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH2(PPh3)3&#173;(NC(H)CH3)] (5a) was determined showing a linear Re&#8208;N&#8208;C unit with rhenium&#8208;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8208;carbon double bonds, while the N=CH&#8208;C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;. Two previously unknown polymorphs of [ReH5(PPh3)3] were isolated from reactions of 1 with HOC6H3(CH3)2 and thiourea after prolonged heating in toluene and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of the rhenium trihydrido complex [ReH3(PPh3)4] (1) has been reinvestigated. An improved synthesis and the solid-state structure of the compound as well as several reactions are reported. The solid-state structure of 1 is similar to that of [TcH3(PPh3)4] having a capped-octahedral coordination sphere. The PPh3 ligands surround the Tc atom in a trigonal-pyramidal mode with a short apical Re-P bond (2.300(2)&#160;&#197;) and three longer basal bonds (2.429(2)-2.449(2)&#160;&#197;). Reactions of 1 with monodentate phosphines such as PMe3 or PBu3 give the mono-substituted complexes [ReH3(PPh3)3(PMe3)] (2) and [ReH3(PPh3)3(PBu3)] (3) under retention of the apical PPh3 ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh3 ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh3&amp;gt;PMe3&amp;gt;PBu3. Treatment of [ReH3(PPh3)4] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH4(NCCH3)(PPh3)3]+ (4), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] (5).

The solid-state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH2(PPh3)3&#173;(NC(H)CH3)] (5a) was determined showing a linear Re-N-C unit with rhenium-nitrogen and nitrogen-carbon double bonds, while the N=CH-C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;. Two previously unknown polymorphs of [ReH5(PPh3)3] were isolated from reactions of 1 with HOC6H3(CH3)2 and thiourea after prolonged heating in toluene and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nontoxic Artificial Chloride Channel Formation in Epithelial Cells by Isophthalic Acid&#8208;Based Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nontoxic Cl&#8722; transport: The work reports two structurally simple isophthalic acid&#8208;based systems that self&#8208;assemble via different intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions to render artificial channels, which facilitate selective translocation of Cl&#8722; ions across liposomes and cells. Interestingly, the transport of Cl&#8722; ions by these ion channels across cell membranes do not exert any toxicity, even at elevated concentrations.







Abstract
Artificial channels capable of facilitating the transport of Cl&#8722; ions across cell membranes while being nontoxic to the cells are rare. Such synthetic ion channels can mimic the functions of membrane transport proteins and, therefore, have the potential to treat channelopathies by replacing defective ion channels. Here we report isophthalic acid&#8208;based structurally simple molecules 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a, which self&#8208;assemble to render supramolecular nanochannels that allow selective transport of Cl&#8722; ions. As evident from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the self&#8208;assembly is governed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The MD simulation studies for both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a confirmed the formation of stable Cl&#8722; channel assembly in the lipid membrane and Cl&#8722; transport through them. The MQAE assay showed the efficacy of the compounds in delivering Cl&#8722; ions into cells, and the MTT assays proved that the compounds are nontoxic to cells even at a concentration of 100&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Aromatic 1,2&#8208;Azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yls as Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Anionic Nitrogen Ligands for Main Group Elements</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;protonated, N&#8208;lithiated and N&#8208;stannylated 1,2&#8208;azaborinines provide versatile platforms for the synthesis of new group 1&#8211;2 and 13&#8211;15 derivatives of the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses show that the aromatic 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand is a purely electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;ligand lacking &#960;&#8208;donor ability.







Abstract
The 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines 1&#8208;EMe3 and 2&#8208;EMe3 (E=Si, Sn; aryl=Ph (1), Mes (=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl, 2)) were synthesized by ring&#8208;expansion of borole precursors with N3EMe3&#8208;derived nitrenes. Desilylative hydrolysis of 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;SiMe3 yielded the corresponding N&#8208;protonated azaborinines, which were deprotonated with nBuLi or MN(SiMe3)2 (M=Na, K) to the corresponding group 1 salts, 1&#8208;M and 2&#8208;M. While the lithium salts crystallized as monomeric Lewis base adducts, the potassium salts formed coordination polymers or oligomers via intramolecular K&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;aryl &#960; interactions. The reaction of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with CO2 yielded N&#8208;carboxylate salts, which were derivatized by salt metathesis to methyl and silyl esters. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with methyl triflate, [Cp*BeCl] (Cp*=C5Me5), BBr2Ar (Ar=Ph, Mes, 2&#8208;thienyl), ECl3 (E=B, Al, Ga) and PX3 (X=Cl, Br) afforded the respective group 2, 13 and 15 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl complexes. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;K with BBr3 resulted not only in N&#8208;borylation but also Ph&#8208;Br exchange between the endocyclic and exocyclic boron atoms. Solution 11B&#8197;NMR data suggest that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand is similarly electron&#8208;withdrawing to a bromide. In the solid state the endocyclic bond length alternation and the twisting of the C4BN ring increase with the sterics of the substituents at the boron and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that the downfield shift of the endocyclic 11B&#8197;NMR resonances is linearly correlated to both the degree of twisting of the C4BN ring and the tilt angle of the N&#8208;substituent. Calculations indicate that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand has no sizeable &#960;&#8208;donor ability and that the aromaticity of the ring can be subtly tuned by the electronics of the N&#8208;substituent.

         <title>Selective Separation of Hazardous Chemicals from Vapor Phase by an Easily Accessible Breathing Coordination Polymer Derived from Terpyridyl/terephthalate Mixed Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
A Zn(II)&#8208;terpyridine based mixed ligand coordination polymer has been designed and synthesized that displayed remarkable ability to breath in response to vapours of a large variety of guests in selective manner.







Abstract
Coordination polymers are extensively studied materials because of their various potential applications. Amongst them, breathing coordination polymers that are capable of exchanging lattice occluded guest molecules with other guests via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8211;SC) fashion are particularly intriguing. Herein, we disclose an easily accessible breathing coordination polymer namely DMF@Zn&#8208;CP capable of exchanging as many as 23 guest molecules of various kinds in SC&#8211;SC fashion when the crystals of the coordination polymer were exposed to the corresponding vapor of the guests. Selectivity experiments revealed that it was also capable of separating selectively hazardous chemicals such as dichloro&#8208;methane, benzene and fluorobenzene from the corresponding complex mixture of vapors of halomethanes, aromatic hydrocarbons and halobenzenes. The breathing coordination polymer could also be exploited as drug delivery vehicle; slow and sustained release of anti&#8208;bacterial agents (benzyl alcohol/phenethyl amine) as guests against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria was evident in zone inhibition assays. A mixed ligand strategy wherein a nitrile containing terpyridyl ligand (L) and terephthalate (TA) co&#8208;ligand were reacted with Co(II)/Ni(II)/Zn(II) nitrate salts was adopted herein. Three coordination polymers namely MeOH@Co&#8208;CP, DMF/H2O@Ni&#8208;CP and DMF@Zn&#8208;CP were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Studies revealed that only DMF@Zn&#8208;CP possessed the ability to breath in response to the vapors of the guests as stimuli.

         <title>Synthesis and Single&#8208;Electron Oxidation of Bulky Bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides: The Quest for Kinetically Stabilized Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetically stabilized diaryltelluride radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] was obtained by electrochemical and chemical oxidation of the neutral parent telluride (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te.







Abstract
Sterically encumbered bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides, (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2E (E=S, Se, Te) were obtained by the reaction of the chalcogen tetrafluorides, EF4, with three equivalents of m&#8208;terphenyl lithium, 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3Li. The single&#8208;electron oxidation of (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te using XeF2/K[B(C6F5)4] afforded the radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] that was isolated and fully characterized. The electrochemical oxidation of the lighter homologs (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2E (E=S, Se) was irreversible and impaired by rapid decomposition.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Defect&#8208;Rich Vanadium Oxides as Reversible Polysulfide Conversion Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decreasing dissolution: A defect&#8208;rich sodium vanadium oxide with a proton doping nanobelt was fabricated and used as the functional interface layer in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects and catalytic activity, the dissolution of polysulfide was greatly decreased. The graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier. Therefore, the design of the electrode/separator interface layer is beneficial for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted attention due to their high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery's life. We have successfully fabricated a defect&#8208;rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and used it as the functional interface layer on the separator in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in the electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Moreover, the extra graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, a Li&#8208;S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies of Anion Exchange Membranes in Hydrogen&#8208;electricity Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline hydrogen&#8208;electricity energy conversion technologies, involving anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are more appealing than the acidic counterparts due to the elimination of precious metal catalysts. However, the physicochemical properties of anion exchange membrane (AEMs), i.e., ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, stability, etc., are inferior to that of proton exchange membranes (PEMs), thus hindering these alkaline technologies from practical employment. To promote their development, we summarize the main challenges and the corresponding strategies of AEMs for the application of AEMFCs and AEMWEs in this review. The hydroxide transportation mechanism, ion exchange capacity, hydration and microscopic morphology that are relevant to the ionic conductivity are discussed firstly. Following the ionic conductivity, another obstacle, stability of AEMs is comprehensively described in terms of alkaline stability, mechanical stability and electrochemical stability. Upon integrating into the devices, water management, carbonation effect and membrane&#8208;electrode interface that are critical to the cell performance are highlighted as well. This review is anticipated to provide insights into the AEM design for hydrogen&#8208;electric energy conversion devices, thus accelerating the widespread commercialization of these promising technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Si on the Oxidation Behaviors of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of Si alters the mass diffusion in the oxide scale of the Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000&#8201;&#176;C, which facilitates the diffusion of Ti, Al, as well as O atoms, thus impacting the structure of the oxide scale and its oxidation resistance.







Abstract
In this work, Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 (x=0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) with Al/Si solid solution structure are synthesized, and the effects of Si on their oxidation behaviors at 1000&#8201;&#176;C are evaluated. The addition of Si not only contributes to the formation of Ti5Si3 impurity but also affects the composition of the oxide scale. Particularly, the incorporation of Si in the TiO2 lattice is demonstrated, which alters the formation energy of the (110) plane in TiO2, thus leading to the preferential growth of Si&#8208;doped TiO2 to dendritic congeries. Moreover, the Si addition is believed to affect mass transportation during the oxidation process, which accelerates the formation of a continuous Al2O3 layer in the oxide scale. With an optimized Si content, the oxidation of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 is restrained. However, with excess Si content, the continuity of the resulting Al2O3 layer is destroyed, thus the oxidation rate rises again.

         <title>Highly selective monomethylation of amines with CO2/H2 via Ag/Al2O3 as catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of monomethylated amines with CO2 is particularly challenging because the formation of tertiary amines is thermodynamically more favorable. Here we explore a new strategy for the controllable synthesis of N&#8208;monomethylated amines from primary amines and CO2/H2. Our first&#8208;principle calculations reveal that the dissociation of H2 via an heterolytic route reduces the reactivity of methylated amines and thus inhibit successive methylation. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS prove the process of formation and decomposition of ammonium salt by secondary amine reversible binding with H+ on the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, thereby reducing its reactivity. Meanwhile, the energy barrier for rate&#8208;determining step of monomehylation was much lower than that of over methylation (0.34 eV vs 0.58 eV) means amines monomethylation in preference to successive methylation. Under optimal reaction conditions, a variety of amines conversion to corresponding monomethylated amines in good to excellent yields, and more than 90% yield of product obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Rare&#8208;Earth/Lithium&#8208;Mediated Conversion of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The rare&#8208;earth/lithium cooperative effect on activation and functionalization of white phosphorus has been investigated. The reaction of diazabutadiene&#8208;supported&#160;yttrium hydride chelated a LiPPh2 molecule (LY&#215;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2[&#956;&#8208;PPh2(Li)] (1, L = N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene) with P4 gave two novel mixed Y/Li multinuclear polyphosphorus complexes(LY&#215;THF)2[cyclo&#8208;P3]Li(THF)3 (2) and [Li(THF)4]+[(LY&#215;THF)3(norborane&#8208;P7)Li(THF)]&#8208; (3), accompanied with the elimination of diphosphorus compound Ph2PPPh2 (4) and H2. However, the comparative reaction of yttrium hydride (LY&#215;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2&#160;with P4 afforded a trinuclear yttrium star&#8208;P4 complex (LY&#215;THF)3(m3&#8208;P(PH)3) (5). Further investigations show that 5 cannot continuously react with LiPPh2 to form 2 and 3, and LiPPh2 reacted with P4 to form a Zintl&#8208;P7 lithium complex (TMEDA.Li)3(Zintl&#8208;P7) (6) and 4. These results indicated that the cooperation of Y/Li for activation of P4 is a key for the formation of 2 and 3. All new compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Internal Charge Transfer on the Photophysical Properties of Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phosphaquinolinone scaffold has been previously studied as a modular core for a variety of fluorescent species where use of substituent effects has focused on increasing or decreasing electron density in the core rings. We now report the synthesis and analysis of several pyridine&#8208;containing phosphaquinolinone species exhibiting notable linear conjugation from the aryl&#8208;substituent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridyl nitrogen. Varying the nature of the aryl substituent from electron&#8208;withdrawing to electron&#8208;donating leads to the generation of an internal charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) band in the absorbance spectrum, which becomes the dominant absorbance in terms of intensity in the most electron&#8208;rich &#8211;NMe2 example. This heterocycle exhibits improved photophysical properties compared to others in the set including high quantum yield and considerably red&#8208;shifted emission. The enhanced ICT can be observed in the X&#8208;ray data where a rare example of molecule co&#8208;planarity is observed. Computational data show increased localization of negative charge on the pyridyl nitrogen as the electron&#8208;donating character of the aryl&#8208;substituent increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid&#8208;State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid&#8208;state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill&#8208;defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive&#8208;linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid&#8208;state current&#8208;voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion&#8208;induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B&#8208;form.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Structure and Photo&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Electric Property of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Liquid Crystalline Polymer Containing Poly(4&#8208;vinylpridine) and Cyanostilbene Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE) x , where x is the molar ratio of cyanostilbene (CN&#8208;DBE) to poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) repeating unit, were synthesized based on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between P4VP and CN&#8208;DBE. Their luminescent property, liquid crystalline structure and photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property were elucidated using photoluminescence spectra, X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal imaging and thermoelectric experiments. With the increase of x, the supramolecular system can be changed from lamellar structure to hexagonal columnar structure. Moreover, the P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE) x  polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photothermal effect. The temperature of P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)0.6 can rise to 130 &#176;C within 10 s under the irradiation of ultraviolet lamp. In addition, the supramolecular system possesses unique photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric conversion ability, and 25 mA current can be detected in the circuit coupled with the thermoelectric module. This work broadens the potential applications of hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer, and provides a simple and facile strategy to prepare liquid crystalline polymers with photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezoelectric&#160;Metal Organic Frameworks Mediated Mechanoredox&#160;Borylation&#160;and Arylation Reactions via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein,&#160;metal organic frameworks&#160;UiO&#8208;66 and&#160;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;were synthesized and their piezoelectric&#160;properties were characterized by piezoresponse force&#160;microscopy. Under mechanical agitation, the highly polarized UiO&#8208;66 and&#160;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;can act as electron donors&#160;to reduce aryl diazonium salts, forming the aryl radical species which further react with bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes to generate the desired products&#160;with broad substrate scope. For all substrates, it was found that the reactions mediated by UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;which exhibited better piezoelectric property were more efficient than those promoted by UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, we have shown the convenient regeneration of spent catalysts&#160;which can be reused for promoting mechanoredox reactions without loss of activities by taking advantage of the unmatched repairability of metal organic frameworks. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical pathway was involved in these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The allylic alcohol structural motif is prevalent in many important molecules and valuable building blocks. The rearrangement reaction is one of the most important transformations, however there are only a few reports for the 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols. Herein, we describe a 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols catalyzed by an Ir(III) dihydride complex. This reaction could provide the corresponding less accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively from readily available E/Z mixtures of the substrates. Furthermore, a tandem alkene isomerization followed by 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of homoallylic alcohols was also realized. In addition, this rearrangement reaction could be used to synthesize the natural product Navenone B. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the reaction pathway involved a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and that the dihydride in the iridium catalyst acts as a hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of the iridium center.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical and Structural Characterization of Soft Landed Tungsten&#8208;Substituted Lindqvist Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lindqvist polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion processes due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten&#8208;substituted POV&#8208;alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms. Soft landing of mass&#8208;selected ions was used to purify heterometal POV&#8208;alkoxides that cannot be readily separated using conventional approaches. The soft landed POV&#8208;alkoxides are characterized using infrared reflection&#8208;absorption spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The redox properties of the isolated ions are examined using an in situ electrochemical cell which enables traditional in vacuo electrochemical measurements inside of an ion soft landing instrument. Although the overall cluster core retains redox activity after tungsten doping, vanadium&#8208;based redox couples (VV/VIV) are shifted substantially, indicating a pronounced effect of a heteroatom on the electronic structure of the core.</dc:description>

         <title>Captodative Effect Facilitates the Excitation in Diboron Molecule (CAAC)2B2(SH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the extraordinary versatility in chemical reactions and applications, boron compounds have gained increasing attentions in the past two decades. One of the remarkable advances is the unprecedented preparation of unsaturated boron species. Notably, Braunschweig et al. found that the cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs) stabilized diboron molecules (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 host unpaired electrons and exist in the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form, while other analogues such as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) stabilized diboron molecules prefer a conventional B=B double bond. Since previous studies recognized the differences in the steric effect between CAAC and NHC carbenes, here we focused on the role of thiol substituents in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by gradually localizing involved electrons. The co&#8208;planarity of the thiol groups and the consequent captodative effect were found to be the culprit for the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form of (CAAC)2B2(SR)2. Computational analyses identified two forces contributing to the &#960; electron movements. One is the &#8220;push&#8221; effect of lone pairs on the sulfur atoms which boosts the &#960; electron delocalization between the BB center and CAACs. The other is the &#960; electron delocalization within each (CAAC)B(SR) fragment where the pull effect originates from the &#960; electron withdrawal by CAACs. There are two such independent and orthogonal push&#8208;pull channels which function mainly in individual (CAAC)B(SR) fragments. This enhanced &#960; push&#8208;pull effect in the triplet state facilitates the electronic excitation in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Coumarin C&#8211;H Functionalization by Mn(I) Carbonyls: Mechanistic Insight by Ultra&#8208;Fast IR Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn(I) C&#8211;H functionalization of coumarins provides a versatile and practical method for the rapid assembly of fused polycyclic pyridinium&#8208;containing coumarins in a regioselective manner. The synthetic strategy enables application of bench&#8208;stable organomanganese reagents in both photochemical&#8208; and thermal &#8208;promoted reactions. The cyclomanganated intermediates, and global reaction system, provide an ideal testing ground for structural characterization of the active Mn(I) carbonyl&#8208;containing species, including transient species observable by ultra&#8208;fast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. The thermodynamic reductive elimination product, solely encountered from reaction between alkynes and air&#8208;stable organometallic cyclomanganated coumarins, has enabled characterization of a critical seven&#8208;membered Mn(I) intermediate, detected by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy, enabling the elucidation of the temporal profile of key steps in the reductive elimination pathway. Quantitative data are provided. Managanated polycyclic products are readily decomplexed by AgBF 4 , opening&#8208;up an efficient route to the formation of &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>An Innovative Bi12SiO20 Multistage Cubic Nanospheres Cathode for High&#8208;performance Bi//Zn Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline&#160;Bi//Zn&#160;batteries&#160;with superb&#160;safety,&#160;low cost, and high power density are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. However, their developments&#160;are&#160;severely limited by the Bi&#8208;based cathode as the unsatisfying capacity and cycle&#160;life. Herein, an innovative multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20&#160;(MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20) is successfully synthesized by a simple&#160;calcination&#160;methode, which shows&#160;excellent&#160;energy storage performances&#160;of superior&#160;specific capacity (294&#160;mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.5&#160;A g&#8208;1)&#160;and&#160;outstanding rate capability&#160;(134 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 12&#160;A g&#8208;1). When coupled with Zn anode a superior MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 247.5&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1&#160;at the power density of 375&#160;W kg&#8208;1. Additionally, the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn battery shows excellent cycle life, which reserves more than 100% of its original capacity after 5000 cycles. Such performance is higher than previously reported Bi//Zn battery and most other Zn batteries. This is the first example of using Bi12SiO20&#160;as cathode for&#160;RAZBs, which may provide highly promising&#160;material towards better Bi//Zn&#160;battery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures via  i &#960;&#8211; i &#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, was synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the lifetimes of the radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer of the ion pairs could be controlled by a judicious combination of the anions and cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Diverse Diterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus and Its Sponge&#8208;prey Chelonaplysilla sp.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigation of the South China Sea nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded, in addition to three known compounds, nine new diterpenoids of the 5,19&#8208;cycloclerodane&#8208; (sanyanolides A&#8722;D), clerodane&#8208; (sanyanolide E) and subersin&#8208; (sanyanolides F&#8722;I) type. Remarkably, six diterpenoids aforementioned from H. sanguineus were also isolated from the sponge Chelonaplysilla sp. from the same water region, suggesting a trophic relationship between H. sanguineus and Chelonaplysilla sp. The structure and absolute configuration of new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and/or time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these diterpenoids, along with the chemo&#8208;ecological implications of their co&#8208;occurrence in the two organisms investigated, was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassays, echinoclerodane A exhibited a potent inhibitory effect (IC50 = 2.81 &#956;M) on LPS&#8208;induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. In addition, echinoclerodane A and oculatolide showed considerable antibacterial activities with MIC values ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 &#956;g/mL.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Potent and Highly Selective Epoxyketone&#8208;based Plasmodium Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present remarkable epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000&#8208;fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic&#8208;stage P. falciparum over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D&#8208;amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from P. falciparum cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171&#8208;fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of P. falciparum proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a P. berghei mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6 days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti&#8208;malarial drugs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&gt;Herein, we present a highly diastereoselective method to furnish acyclic 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diol derivatives using a tandem double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko protocol (&lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; up to &amp;gt;99:1) using a butanone derived sulfinylimine. In most cases only 1 diastereomer predominates, from a possible 16. The reaction is also regioselective. In addition, the highly challenging cyclobutanone and 3&#8208;pentanone derivatives are also amenable to a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction, although the &lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; values are modest. Despite that, clean single diastereoisomers can be isolated, which should prove very useful in medicinal chemistry and other areas. Detailed DFT calculations support the observed stereoselectivities in all cases, providing a rationale for the excellent &lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; values in the butanone series and the moderate values for the 3&#8208;pentanone class.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(boranil) Columnar Liquid Crystalline Fluorophores: pseudo&#8208;Triphenylene Boron(III) Complexes with N3B3O3 Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borate complexes derived from salicylaldimine ligands, called boranils, possess a wide range of photophysical and electronic characteristics intrinsically. The unique combination of molecular rigidity, rendered by four&#8208;coordinate boron bridges, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation enable them to serve as technically feasible fluorescent materials (dyes). The incorporation of liquid crystallinity in these boron(III) complexes, especially the columnar (col) mesomorphism, which is overlooked hitherto, would provide a new dimension to these complexes. Herein, we report the first examples of tris(boranil) discotic liquid crystal (LC) dyes that have been readily synthesized by treating tris(N&#8208;salicylideneaniline)s, (TSAN)s, with BF3.Et2O in the presence of an acid quencher. These&#160;C3&#8208;symmetric borate complexes self&#8208;assemble into Col phase, existing over a wide thermal span including room temperature.&#160; The 2D periodic order of the Col phases shows dependence on the length of the peripheral tails. The photophysical measurements reveal the fluorescence emission in their two condensed states viz., solid and Col phase, and in the solution. Their electrochemical, two&#8208;step oxidation process coupled with the aforesaid features upholds their significance in applied research.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects in Iron Porphyrin Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comparison of differently substituted iron porphyrins in their as&#8208;prepared state and after immobilization on carbon indicates no or only a weak interaction with the carbon support. Hydrogen evolution catalysis of the supported systems is improved by electron donating groups that destabilize an Fe(II) intermediate, presumably by assisting in the formation of a radical anion.







Abstract
For a future hydrogen economy, non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the water splitting reactions are needed that can be implemented on a global scale. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) catalysts with active sites constituting a metal center with fourfold coordination of nitrogen (MN4) show promising performance, but an optimization rooted in structure&#8208;property relationships has been hampered by their low structural definition. Porphyrin model complexes are studied to transfer insights from well&#8208;defined molecules to MNC systems. This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphyrin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance. We propose an HER mechanism for supported iron porphyrin complexes involving a [FeII(P&#8901;)]&#8722; radical anion intermediate, in which a porphinic nitrogen atom acts as an internal base. While this work focuses on the HER, the limited influence of a simultaneous interaction with the support and an aqueous electrolyte will likely be transferrable to other catalytic applications.

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;containing species can &#8220;chemically trap&#8221; CO2, and nesquehonite is one such metastable mineral. Its chemical formula has been debated for decades as Mg(HCO3)(OH)&#8901;2&#8201;H2O or MgCO3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O. The thermodynamics of the route to stable carbonates require knowledge of the captured CO2 as either a carbonate or bicarbonate. To determine the precise atomic coordinates of hydrogens present, we combined solid&#8208;state 13C NMR lineshapes and REDOR with density functional theory and confirmation by neutron diffraction. The perturbation of 13C NMR lineshapes by nearby hydrogens is a persuasive indicator. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;E. Hayes and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203052).

         <title>Energy Level, Crystal Morphology and Fluorescence Emission Tuning in Cocrystals via Molecular&#8208;Level Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

New DCAF based charge transfer cocrystals with tunable energy level, crystal morphology and fluorescence emission were prepared via a cocrystal engineering method.







Abstract
Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene &#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through a rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering strategy. Although they are both 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structures, the DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DCPY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted DCPE nanobelts, and the small band gap causes near infrared fluorescence. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space groups and weaker intermolecular interactions exhibited an untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.

         <title>Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on of Tetraphenylethylene Derivative by Transfer from Cyclodextrin to Liposomes, HeLa Cells, and E. coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's fluorescence time! Although the tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) was fluorescence OFF state in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx), the fluorescence turn&#8208;on was observed in the liposomes, HeLa cells, and E. coli, because TPE&#8722;OH4 was transferred from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid or cell membranes.







Abstract
Herein, trimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx) and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) in water through high&#8208;speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was much higher than that of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex, as the rotation of the central C=C double bond of TPE&#8722;OH4 after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8722;OH4 from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, it was demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase&#8208;transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon, TPE&#8722;OH4 could detect the presence of HeLa cells and E. coli by fluorescence.

         <title>Disproportionation and Ligand Lability in Low Oxidation State Boryl&#8208;Tin Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbene&#8208;stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2], can be synthesized from (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br using Mg(I) or K reducing agents. In contrast to their germanium congeners, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation: NHC abstraction from (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and 2&#8208;electron oxidation of K2[Sn2(boryl)2] both yield a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of Sn(boryl)2 and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4. A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve the vinylidene&#8208;type intermediate (boryl)2Sn=Sn.







Abstract
Boryltin compounds featuring the metal in the+1 or 0 oxidation states can be synthesized from the carbene&#8208;stabilized tin(II) bromide (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br (boryl={B(NDippCH)2}; NHC=C{(NiPrCMe)2}) by the use of strong reducing agents. The formation of the mono&#8208;carbene stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) (2) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2] (3), using Mg(I) and K reducing agents mirrors related germanium chemistry. In contrast to their lighter congeners, however, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation. Carbene abstraction from 2 using BPh3, and two&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 both result in the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of the Sn(II) compound Sn(boryl)2, and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4 (4). A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve a vinylidene intermediate (analogous to the isolable germanium compound, (boryl)2Ge=Ge), which undergoes facile atom transfer to generate Sn(boryl)2 and trinuclear [Sn3(boryl)2]. The latter then dimerizes to give the observed hexametallic product 4, with independent studies showing that similar trigermanium species aggregate in analogous fashion.

For its binding to the La(hfac)3 lanthanum container, the benzimidazole side arms of the terdentate ligand L1 must rotate to reach the cis&#8208;cis arrangement required for the formation of the heteroleptic [L1La(hfac)3] complex. The novel rigid, planar and cis&#8208;cis preorganized ligand L8 avoids this energy penalty and increases the overall stability of the final [L8La(hfac)3] complex by three orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations has successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more overlooked. The resulting rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (L1&#8211;L7) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;h][1,7]naphthyridines (L8&#8211;L11) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [LkLn(hfac)3] adducts (Lk=L1, L8, L9; Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb, Y; H&#8208;hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) show a drastic decrease in the Ln&#8722;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand L1 with its preorganized counterparts L8 and L9. This points to a limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)3] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion, with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)3 when L1 is replaced by the preorganized L8&#8211;L9 receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [L1Ln(hfac)3] complexes in solution. This driving force overcomes the poor match between the preorganized terdentate N&#8745;N&#8745;N cavity in L8 and L9 and the size of trivalent lanthanides. As planned, the rigid, planar and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system found in L8 and L9 shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands by about 5000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 toward lower energies, a crucial point if these stable [L8Ln(hfac)3] and [L9Ln(hfac)3] platforms have to be considered for the visible sensitization of luminescent lanthanides in metallopolymers.

&lt;p&gt;The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10-phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d-block cations has successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f-block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more overlooked. The resulting rigidification of 2,6-bis(1-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridine ligands (&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L7&lt;/b&gt;) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4-b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-h][1,7]naphthyridines (&lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L11&lt;/b&gt;) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands.
