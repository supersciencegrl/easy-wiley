         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence Tetrametallic Iridium Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral [X&#8208;{Ir2}&#8208;{Ir2}&#8208;X] (X = Cl, Br, SCN, I) and dicationic [L&#8208;{Ir2}&#8208;{Ir2}&#8208;L]2+ (L = MeCN, Me2CO) tetrametallic iridium chains made by connecting two dinuclear {Ir2} units ({Ir2} = [Ir2(&#956;&#8208;OPy)2(CO)4], OPy = 2&#8208;pyridonate) by an iridium&#8208;iridium bond are described. The complexes exhibit fractional averaged oxidation states of +1.5 and electronic delocalization along the metallic chain. While the axial ligands do not significantly affect the metal&#8208;metal bond lengths, the metallic chain has a significant impact on the iridium&#8208;L/X bond distances. The complexes show free rotation around the unsupported iridium&#8208;iridium bond in solution, with a low&#8208;energy transition state for the chloride chain. The absorption spectra of these complexes show characteristic bands at 438&#8208;504 nm, which can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the terminal capping ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as Functional Platform for Peptide Stapling and Multicyclisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluorinated aromatic reagents readily react with thiolates&#160;via&#160;nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and provide excellent scaffolds for peptide cyclisation. Here we report a robust and versatile platform for peptide stapling and multicyclisation templated by&#160;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin, opening the door to the next generation of functional scaffolds for 3D peptide architectures. We demonstrate that stapling and multicyclisation occurs with a range of non&#8208;protected peptides under peptide&#8208;compatible conditions, exhibiting chemoselectivity and wide&#8208;applicability. Peptides containing two cysteine residues are readily stapled, and the remaining perfluoroaryl groups permit the introduction of a second peptide in a modular fashion to access bicyclic peptides. Similarly, peptides with more than two cysteine residues can afford multicyclic products containing up to three peptide &#8216;loops&#8217;.&#160;Finally, we demonstrate that a porphyrin&#8208;templated stapled peptide containing the Skin Penetrating and Cell Entering (SPACE) peptide affords a skin cell penetrating conjugate with intrinsic fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Oxides as Control Element for the Direction of a Sigmatropic Rearrangement. Application as a Switch for Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exceptional level of control over the direction of the (2,3)&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement between N&#8208;oxides and alkoxylamine is achieved by simply changing the solvent in which they are dissolved. Protic solvents like water, methanol and hexafluoroisopropanol favor the N&#8208;oxide form, while other solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and benzene favor the alkoxylamine. The reaction temperature and nature of the substituents on the alkene affect the rate of rearrangement. A N&#8208;oxide fragment was attached to two fluorescent molecules and acted as an on/off switch for their fluorescence. The conversion of alkoxylamines into the corresponding N&#8208;oxides has not previously been described and is here termed the &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;.</dc:description>

         <title>[3+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes with Azomethine Ylides &#8211; Access to Novel Fluorinated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorinated moieties into drugs as well as the increase of their overall three&#8208;dimensionality have become key strategies amongst medicinal chemists to generate sets of compounds with favorable drug&#8208;like properties. However, the introduction of fluorinated cyclopropane ring systems which combines both strategies is not widely exploited to date. This paper reports synthetic strategies exploiting the reactivity of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with azomethine ylides to afford sets of new fluorine&#8208;containing 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. In addition, the unexpected formation of complex trifluorinated scaffolds arising from proline esters and gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes is highlighted along with computational studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism. This study presents new avenues towards pharmaceutically relevant fluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes that are accessible via robust and short synthetic sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent advances of unexcited light source imaging for biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging has a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, allowing the visualizsation of physiological processes and helping in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Unexcited light source imaging technologies,such as chemiluminescence imaging, bioluminescence imaging and afterglow imaging have attracted great attention in recent years because of the absence of excitation light interference in their application and the advantages of high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In this review, the latest advances in unexcited light source imaging technology for biomedical applications are highlighted. The design strategies of unexcited light source luminescent probes in improving luminescence brightness, penetration depth, quantum yield and targeting, and their applications in inflammation imaging, tumor imaging, liver and kidney injury imaging and bacterial infection imaging are introduced in detail. The research progress and future prospects of unexcited light source imaging for medical applications are further discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Far&#8208;Red Excitation Induced Electron Transfer in Bis Donor&#8208;AzaBODIPY Push&#8208;Pull Systems; Role of Nitrogenous Donors in Promoting Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A far&#8208;red absorbing sensitizer, BF2&#8208;chelated azadipyrromethane (azaBODIPY) has been employed as an electron acceptor to synthesize a series of push&#8208;pull systems&#160;linked with a series of nitrogenous electron donors, viz., N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline, triphenylamine, and phenothiazine via an acetylene linker. The structural integrity of the newly synthesized triads was established by spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and DFT methods. Differential pulse voltammetry studies revealed different redox states and helped in the estimation of the energies of the charge&#8208;separated states. Further, spectroelectrochemical studies performed revealed diagnostic peaks of azaBODIPY&#8226;&#8211; in the visible and near&#8208;IR regions. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed the charge separation from one of the covalently linked donors to the 1azaBODIPY* to yield Donor&#8226;+&#8208;azaBODIPY&#8226;&#8211; to be energetically favorable in a polar solvent, benzonitrile. The femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies revealed the occurrence of excited charge transfer (CT) in nonpolar toluene while a complete charge separation (CS) for all three triads in polar benzonitrile. The CT/CS products populated the low&#8208;lying 3azaBODIPY* prior to returning to the ground state. Global target (GloTarAn) analysis of the transient data revealed the lifetime of the final charge&#8208;separated states (CSS) to be 195 ps for NND&#8208;derived, 50 ps for TPA&#8208;derived, and 85 ps for PTZ&#8208;derived triads in benzonitrile.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydration Rearrangement in the 4&#8208;Aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 Cluster Induced by Photoionization: The Effect of Solvent&#8208;Solvent Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydration dynamics and the role of water&#8208;water interaction at the single&#8208;molecule level. Excess energy dependence of IR spectra of the isolated 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster reveals that photoionization initiates the migration of an intact water dimer from the CN site to the NH site.







Abstract
The interplay between solute&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions plays an essential role in solvation dynamics that has important effects on the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In this study, the rearrangement of the hydration shell induced by photoionization of a solute molecule is probed in a state&#8208; and isomer&#8208;specific manner by resonant multiphoton ionization detected IR spectroscopy of the prototypical 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster produced in a molecular beam. IR spectra reveal that the water molecules form a cyclic solvent network around the CN group in the initial neutral state (S0). Different from the singly&#8208;hydrated cluster, in which either the CN or the NH2 group is hydrated, hydration of the NH2 group is not observed in the dihydrated cluster. IR spectra obtained after ionizing the solute molecule into the cation ground state (D0) exhibit features ascribed to both NH&#8208;bound and CN&#8208;bound isomers, indicating that water molecules migrate from the CN to the NH site upon ionization with a yield depending on the ionization excess energy. Analysis of the IR spectra as a function of the excess energy shows that migration produces two different NH2 solvated structures, namely (i) the most stable structure in which both N&#8722;H bonds are singly hydrated and (ii) the second most stable isomer in which one of the N&#8722;H bonds is hydrated by a H&#8208;bonded (H2O)2 dimer. The product branching ratio of the two isomers depends on the excess energy. The role of the water&#8208;water interaction in the hydration rearrangement is discussed based on the potential energy landscape. Solvation dynamics plays an important role in reaction mechanisms in the condensed phase, where not only solute&#8208;solvent solvation but also solvent&#8208;solvent interactions have a significant influence on the dynamics. Thus, the investigation of solvation dynamics at the molecular level substantially contributes to our understanding of the reaction mechanism. In this study, the dihydrated cluster of 4ABN was utilized as a model for the first solvation layer to elucidate solvent motions induced by ionization of the solute and the role of W&#8722;W interactions for the solvent relaxation.

         <title>Diverse Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Ligated MgI&#8722;MgI&#8208;Bonded Compound with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse reaction types: Reactions of dimagnesium(I) [LMg&#8722;MgL] (L=&#945;&#8208;diimine) with carbodiimides proceed via four pathways: 1) Release of one Me3Si of Me3SiNCNSiMe3 to yield either bridging or mononuclear complexes; 2) N=C=N insertion into the Mg&#8722;Mg bond; 3) coupling of two carbodiimides; and 4) double insertion of carbodiimides into a Mg&#8722;C bond to form an alkyne&#8208;bridged bis(amidinate) [(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2]2&#8722;.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated dimagnesium(I) compound [K(thf)3]2[LMg&#8722;MgL] (1, L=[(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Me)]22&#8722;) displays diverse reactivities toward carbodiimides (RN=C=NR) with different R substituents. In the reaction of 1 with Me3SiNCNSiMe3, one of the easily leaving trimethylsilyl groups is lost to yield the Me3SiNCN&#8722; moiety that either bridges two MgII centers (2) or terminally coordinated (3). In contrast, with the similarly bulky tBuNCNtBu, the carbodiimide inserts into Mg&#8722;Mg bond with accompanying C&#8722;H activation of a ligand or solvent (products 4 and 5). In the case of dicyclohexyl or diisopropyl carbodiimide, reductive C&#8722;C coupling of two RNCNR molecules occurs to form the [C2(NR)4]2&#8722; diamido moiety, which bridges two Mg centers, giving complexes [{K(dme)2}2LMg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL] (6, R=Cy; 7, R=iPr) and [L&#8901;&#8722;Mg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL&#8901;&#8722;] (8). Most interestingly, upon treating 1 with Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3, the acetylide complex [K(dme)][LMg(C&#8801;CSiMe3)(dme)] (9) was prepared, which undergoes a rare &#8220;double insertion&#8221; with CyNCNCy to afford [K(solv)][K(dme)2LMg(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2MgL] (10) containing an acetylenediide&#8208;coupled bis(amidinate) ligand that bridges two Mg atoms.

         <title>Hydrogen bonded dimer of an alcohol with the derived carboxylic acid triggering their sorption by nanoporous&#8208;crystalline PPO films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Films exhibiting nanoporous&#8208;crystalline (NC) phases of poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO), which are highly effective to absorb apolar organic guest molecules, are also able to absorb polar molecules (like alcohols and carboxylic acids) but only from concentrated organic solutions. NC PPO films, which do not absorb alcohols and carboxylic acids from diluted aqueous solutions, exhibits a huge uptake (even above 30wt%) of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA), if BA is obtained by spontaneous room temperature oxidation of BAL in aqueous solution. This phenomenon is rationalized by an easy uptake, mainly by the PPO intrahelical crystalline empty channels, of a BAL/BA 1/1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer. This huge uptake of BAL/BA dimer by NC PPO films, which is also fast for films exhibiting the orientation of the crystalline helices perpendicular to the film plane (c^ orientation), can be exploited for purification of water from BAL, when present in traces. High and fast sorption of a hydrogen bonded dimer and negligible sorption of the two separate compounds is possibly unprecedented for absorbent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of ABCD&#8208;porphyrin Platinum(II) Complexes via Dehydrative Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the development of the first method for porphyrin synthesis by Rothemund in 1935, porphyrin derivatives have been widely investigated and have played an essential role in chemical sciences. Most synthetic routes of porphyrins involve oxidative aromatization. Herein, we present a synthetic method to produce ABCD&#8208;porphyrins, including chiral ones, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving &#8220;coordination, cyclization, and dehydrative aromatization&#8221; using a mono&#8208;dipyrrinatoPt(II)Cl(COE) (COE = cyclooctene) complex as a platinum template.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N Interaction Induced Complementary Chemical Tuning to Design a Dual&#8208;gated Single Molecule Junction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between pyridines and the &#960;&#8208;hole of BeH2 leads to the formation of strong beryllium&#8208;bonded complexes. Theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N bonding interaction can effectively regulate the electronic current through a molecular junction. The electronic conductance exhibits distinct switching behavior depending on the substituent groups at the para position of pyridine, highlighting the role of Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N interaction as a potent chemical gate in the proposed device. The complexes exhibit short intermolecular distances ranging from 1.724 to 1.752 &#197;, emphasizing their strong binding. Detailed analysis of electronic rearrangements and geometric perturbations upon complex formation provides insights into the underlying reasons for the formation of such strong Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N bonds, with bond strengths varying from &#8208;116.25 to &#8208;92.96 kJ/mol. Moreover, the influence of chemical substituents on the local electronic transmission of the beryllium&#8208;bonded complex offers valuable insights for the implementation of a secondary chemical gate in single&#8208;molecule devices. This study paves the way for the development of chemically gateable, functional single&#8208;molecule transistors, advancing the design and fabrication of multifunctional single&#8208;molecule devices in the nanoscale regime.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperatively Catalyzed Activation of Thioglycosides That Bypasses Intermediacy of Glycosyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the activation of thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate by using a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine is reported. Application of the H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method lead to an enhanced stereocontrol.







Abstract
Reported herein is the development of a novel method for activating thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate. This has been achieved through the use of a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine. The enhanced stereocontrol was achieved via the H&#8208;bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method, and the extended trisaccharide synthesis was achieved via iteration of deprotection and glycosylation steps.

         <title>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity Based on Dibenzodioxin Linkage: Design, Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with dibenzodioxin linkage have been reviewed in terms of monomer design based on a wide range of rigid and contorted scaffolds, syntheses, properties, and their applications to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship, which is crucial for tailoring the properties.







Abstract
The development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades has established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and the soluble nature of glassy polymers. Due to their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that potentially find application in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger's base, and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, most of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds are discussed, as well as synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, the prospects of these materials are examined with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs is analyzed, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of (Hetero)Arenes Using Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in the skeletal editing of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with an emphasis on the scope, reactivity, selectivity, and general mechanistic considerations. The impressive breadth of application of this strategy in both drug discovery and total synthesis is also discussed. Existing challenges and perspectives on future research directions to further understanding and new reaction developments are outlined.







Abstract
(Hetero)arenes continue to prove their indispensability in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. As such, the controllable modification of biologically significant (hetero)arenes towards diverse more&#8208;potent complex molecular scaffolds through peripheral and skeletal editing has been considered a challenging goal in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite many excellent reviews on peripheral editing (i.&#8201;e., C&#8722;H functionalization) of (hetero)arenes, their skeletal editings via single atom insertion, deletion, or transmutations have received less attention in the review literature. In this review, we systematically summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art skeletal editing reactions of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with a focus on general mechanistic considerations and their applications in natural product syntheses. The potential opportunities and inherent challenges encountered while developing these strategies are also highlighted.

         <title>Effect of Polymeric Ligand Grafting Region on Confined Assembly of Gold Nanorods in cylindrical nanopores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polystyrene end&#8208;tethered gold nanorod (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefer to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly in cylindrical nanopores.







Abstract
The grafting region of polymeric ligands exhibit a significant influence on the assembly behavior of polymer tethered gold nanorods (AuNRs) in confined space. In this work, the effect of core size, molecular weight and grafting region of ligands on the assembly structure in cylindrical nanopores was investigated. It is found that polystyrene end&#8208;tethered AuNR (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on the entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology that gradually transforms into a spherical shape as the molecular weight increases. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form special structures such as inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefers to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly. The confinement effect was studied as well by varying the diameter of pores. The results show that the nanoparticles prefer to arrange into a regular and ordered assembly structure in the strong confinement spaces. Under the synergy of confined spaces and ligands at both ends, the AuNRs@End&#8722;PS are more likely to form a tilted order&#8208;assembly structure. The results of this work could provide new ideas and guidance for the preparation of ordered assembly of AuNRs with novel structures.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Peptide Carrier for HCl Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCl transport mediated by amphiphilic peptides that structurally resemble lipids is described. Carboxylate and amide NH groups in the scaffold facilitate ion&#8208;pair transport across the membrane by carrier mechanism.







Abstract
Single molecules that co&#8208;transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimmetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provide a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H+&gt;Cl&#8722;. The lipid&#8208;like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule. The biocompatibility, design simplicity, and potential pH regulation of these molecules open up several avenues for their therapeutic use.

         <title>Computational Study of Single Metal Atom Anchored on Black Phosphorus for Methane Oxidation to Methanol by Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu single metal atoms anchored on black phosphorus are designed as efficient and low&#8208;price catalysts for converting methane to methanol. First&#8208;principles calculations show that Cu@BP exhibits the best methane activation performance through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high&#8208;value&#8208;added transportable methanol is a great challenge, which requires high energy input to break the strong C&#8722;H bond. Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, single transition metal atoms (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offers excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.

         <title>Use of Biomass Glycerol as a Reducing Agent for Photocatalytic Deprotection of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides in an Aqueous Suspension of Titanium(IV) Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides was achieved using glycerol as the biomass reducing reagent, water as the solvent, TiO2 as the photocatalyst, and solar light as the light and thermal energy source.







Abstract
Deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides under mild conditions with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is an important chemical procedure. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. Therefore, a TiO2 photocatalyst and glycerol are suitable components of this type of reaction. Stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved, with only CO2 being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO was thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.&#8201;e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.

         <title>Indolocarbazole&#8208;Based Multiple&#8208;Resonance Molecules: an Emerging Class of Full&#8208;Color, Narrowband Emitters for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
The indolocarbazole&#8208;based emitters have recently emerged as a class of acceptor&#8208;free multiple resonance emitters, exhibiting extremely small FWHMs, good color&#8208;tunability from violet to deep red and excellent stability in OLED devices, which are ideal as end emitters in sensitizer&#8208;type OLEDs.







Abstract
Narrowband emitters based on the multiple resonance (MR) effect have shown great promises for applications in high&#8208;definition displays. Though most reported MR emitters adopt the boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene&#8208;like skeleton following the design of the DABNA series, MR materials with the nitrogen&#8208;only indolocarbazole structures have recently emerged and demonstrated good color tunability from violet to deep red and impressive electroluminescence performances in terms of both efficiency and stability. Herein, we will summarize indolocarbazole&#8208;based MR materials in recent reports, with emphasis on their molecular design, synthesis, photophysical and electroluminescence properties as well as some future research directions to unlock the full potential of this fascinating class of materials.

Photoelectron spectra for X&#8722;&#8943;(C4H6)n (X=Cl, Br, I and n=1&#8211;3, 1&#8211;3 and 1&#8211;7 respectively are presented. For all complexes, the calculated structures indicate that butadiene is bound in a bidentate fashion through H&#8208;bonding, with the Cl complex showing the greatest degree of stabilisation of the internal C&#8722;C rotation of cis&#8208;butadiene. These results have implications for gas&#8208;phase clustering in atmospheric and extraterrestrial environments.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase solvation of halides by 1,3&#8208;butadiene has been studied via a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory. Photoelectron spectra for X&#8722;&#8943;(C4H6)n (X=Cl, Br, I where n=1&#8208;3, 1&#8211;3 and 1&#8211;7 respectively) are presented. For all complexes, the calculated structures indicate that butadiene is bound in a bidentate fashion through hydrogen&#8208;bonding, with the chloride complex showing the greatest degree of stabilisation of the internal C&#8722;C rotation of cis&#8208;butadiene. In both Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; complexes, the first solvation shell is shown to be at least 
 from the vertical detachment energies (VDEs), however for I&#8722;, increases in the VDE may suggest a metastable, partially filled, first solvation shell for 
 and a complete shell at

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>

Electrochromism: A modular access to 16 intensely colored, redox&#8208;active heterophenoquinones is presented. Structure to property relationships are identified. This material class is promising as cathodically decoloring electrochromes with well&#8208;defined structures and redox states.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones. These compounds were accessed in a convergent and modular approach, allowing for their efficient synthesis. Tuning of the optical band gap was achieved through &#960;&#8208;extension by annulation of a benzene or tropone moiety to the thiophene, oxidation, change of the heteroatom or by attachment of a donor substituent to the thiophene core. The resulting compounds display intense colors covering the entire visible spectrum. We identified structure&#8208;property relationships and their impact on the HOMO and LUMO levels. Additionally, these materials change color upon reduction and according to in&#8197;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, they are promising electrochromes with cathodic color changes. Seven different electrochromic devices were constructed which all displayed a change in color upon reduction, demonstrating the potential of these new dyes in for example tintable glass.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Cd2+ Removal by MgAl Layered Double Hydroxides with Different Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption mechanism of heavy metals: Cd2+ was removed as CdCO3 for MgAl&#8722;CO3, while Cd2+ could be mineralized in a super&#8208;stable way as CdAl&#8208;LDHs by isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8722;NO3/SO4/Cl. This was attributed to the different binding energies and Gibbs free energies caused by distinct host&#8208;guest interactions of various anions intercalated in MgAl&#8208;LDH.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown great potential as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. Nevertheless, how the host&#8208;guest interactions of LDHs affect the removal mechanism remains to be less explored. Herein, CO32&#8722;/NO3&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/Cl&#8722; intercalated MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions were fabricated and their removal mechanism for Cd2+ was investigated. The removal capacity increased in the order of MgAl&#8722;CO3 (127.3&#8197;mg/g)&lt;MgAl&#8722;SO4 (173.3&#8197;mg/g)&lt;MgAl&#8722;NO3 (305.0&#8197;mg/g)&#8776;MgAl&#8722;Cl (312.5&#8197;mg/g). The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ XRD and XAS demonstrated that Cd2+ was removed as CdCO3 for MgAl&#8722;CO3, while for MgAl&#8722;Cl/NO3/SO4, Cd2+ was removed as CdAl&#8208;LDHs by an isomorphic substitution mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that compared to the CdAl&#8208;LDHs formation the Gibbs free energy of the CdCO3 formation was lower, which made it easier to remove Cd2+ as CdCO3 on MgAl&#8722;CO3. Conversely, isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8722;NO3 to obtain CdAl&#8208;LDHs was a free energy reduction process.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Based Terpyridine Complexes as Antitumor Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>

A family of 4&#8217;&#8208;X&#8208;terpyridines/tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine silver derivatives with or without phosphines as ancillary ligands has shown high cytotoxicity against different tumour cells. In addition, a great selectivity index has been detected for healthy lymphocytes T in some cases. These derivatives interact with CT&#8208;DNA through moderate intercalation, and cell death studies indicate that they promote an apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
Silver complexes bearing substituted terpyridine or tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine ligands have been prepared and structurally characterised. The study of the anticancer properties of silver complexes with this type of ligands is scarce, despite the possibilities of combining the properties of the metal and the ability of the ligands for DNA binding. Here, the antiproliferative activity, stability, CT&#8208;DNA binding, and mechanism of cell death of these types of derivatives are studied. High cytotoxicity against different tumour cells was observed, and, more important, a great selectivity index has been detected between tumour cells and healthy lymphocytes T for some of these compounds. The CT&#8208;DNA interaction study has shown that these derivatives are able to interact with CT&#8208;DNA by moderate intercalation. Furthermore, cell death studies indicate that these derivatives promote the apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway.

         <title>Spontaneous Chiral Resolution of a MnIII Spin&#8208;Crossover Complex with High Temperature 80&#8197;K Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous chiral resolution of the &#916; and &#923; isomers of a racemic mixture of a MnIII spin&#8208;crossover complex is achieved by conglomerate crystallization. The complex exhibits gradual spin crossover with a wide thermal hysteresis, &#8764;80&#8197;K at its maximum, with T1/2&#8593;=250&#8197;K and T1/2&#8595;=200&#8197;K. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism was used to confirm the enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers.







Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric spin&#8208;switchable systems are of interest for their prospective applications as magnetically active non&#8208;linear optical materials and in multiferroic devices. Chiral resolution of simple spin&#8208;crossover chelate complexes into the &#916; and &#923; forms offers a facile route to homochiral magnetic switches, which could be easily enantiomerically enriched. Here, we report the spontaneous resolution of a new hysteretic spin&#8208;crossover complex, [MnIII(sal2323)]SCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;EtOH (1), into &#916; and &#923; forms, without the use of chiral reagents, where sal2323 is a Schiff base resulting from condensation of 1,2&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropylamino)ethane with 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. The enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism. Quantum chemistry calculations were used to investigate the electronic structure. The opening of a wide 80&#8197;K thermal hysteresis window at high temperature highlights the potential for good magneto&#8208;optical function at ambient temperature for materials of this type.

         <title>Disulphide Cross&#8208;Linked Ultrashort Peptide Hydrogelator for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator undergoes disulphide bond formation and forms a self&#8208;supporting, thixotropic, insoluble hydrogel via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. The resultant hydrogelator was exploited to remove toxic organic dyes from contaminated water in the gel phase and solid supports, indicating its potential applicability for water remediation.







Abstract
A single amino acid in a peptide sequence can play an important role to tune the self&#8208;assembly and hydrogelation behaviour. Here, a C&#8208;terminal cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator forms hydrogel through non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions. Interestingly, the hydrogel is insoluble in water and buffer solutions at different pH values (1&#8208;13) and is thixotropic and injectable. In recent years, removing dyes from contaminated water has become a significant concern because of the shortage of freshwater resources. Therefore, the adsorption of dyes through a reliable, straightforward, nontoxic, cheap, and environmentally friendly adsorbent has become a popular topic. Hence, the hydrogelator was exploited to remove organic dyes from wastewater, harnessing its applicability in the gel phase and solid supports (filter paper and cotton).

         <title>Concentration&#8208;, Temperature&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly: Merocyanine Dimerization as a Showcase Example for Obtaining Reliable Thermodynamic Data</title>

         <dc:description>
Comparative UV/Vis absorption studies illustrate the importance to mind the assumptions behind temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent data evaluation to obtain thermodynamic parameters for self&#8208;assembly processes with the same reliability as from classical concentration&#8208;dependent studies.







Abstract
Mathematical models for the concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent analysis of self&#8208;assembly equilibria are derived for the most simple case of dimer formation, to highlight the assumptions these models and the thus determined thermodynamic parameters are based on. The three models were applied to UV/Vis absorption data for the dimerization of a highly dipolar merocyanine dye in 1,4&#8208;dioxane. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) dilution experiments were performed as an independent reference technique. While the concentration&#8208;dependent analysis is according to our studies the most reliable method, also the less time&#8208;consuming temperature&#8208;dependent evaluation can give accurate results in the present example, despite small thermochromic effects. In contrast, the strong negative solvatochromism of the merocyanine tampers with the results from the solvent&#8208;dependent evaluation. Even though the studies presented in this work are limited to the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium of a dipolar dye, the basic principles can be transferred to other chromophores and different self&#8208;assembly models, including those for supramolecular polymerization.

Abstract
Two novel nona&#8208;coordinated Eu(III) complexes [Eu(btfa)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;1) and [Eu(NTA)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;2) have been synthesized and characterized. The structure of the complexes was elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) methods. The experimental photophysical properties of the complexes were investigated and complemented with theoretical calculations. Effective energy transfer (ET) pathways for the sensitized red luminescence is discussed. The complexes were tested as emitting layers (EML) in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). At the optimum doping concentration of 4&#8197;wt.%, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;1 exhibited red electroluminescence (EL) with an EQE of 4.0&#8201;% and maximum brightness (B)=1179&#8197;cd/m2, maximum current efficiency (&#951;c)=5.64&#8197;cd/A, and maximum power efficiency (&#951;p)=4.78&#8197;lm/W at the current density (J) of 10&#8197;mA/cm2. Interestingly, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;2 at the optimum concentration of 3&#8197;wt.%, displayed an outstanding EL performance with EQE of 7.32&#8201;% and B=838&#8197;cd/m2, &#951;c=10.19&#8197;cd/A and &#951;p=10.33&#8197;lm/W at J=10&#8197;mA/cm2. The EL performance of this device is among the best reported for devices incorporating a europium complex as a red emitter.

A total chemical synthesis strategy utilizing UFM1&#8197;C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide as a versatile handle is reported for the facile preparation of UFM1&#8208;derived probes. This approach allows the convenient installation of electrophilic warheads, fluorescent reporters and unnatural purification tags onto the UFM1 sequence.







Abstract
Ufmylation is involved in various cellular processes and associated with many human diseases. The understanding of this modification relies on the use of customized UFM1&#8208;derived probes for activity&#8208;based profiling of its related enzymes. This study presents a highly optimized total chemical synthesis for the generation of diverse UFM1&#8208;derived probes including UFM1&#8208;PA, Biotin&#8208;UFM1&#8208;PA and UFM1&#8208;AMC, in which a UFM1&#8197;C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide was readily prepared by hydrazide&#8208;based ligation and used as a versatile handle for the installation of enzyme&#8208;sensitive warheads and fluorescent reporters. The resulting probes display high reactivity and selectivity for UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes in cell lysates. This strategy facilitates the generation and diversity of the UFM1&#8208;derived toolkit that can be employed to profile UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes, thereby shining insights into the dynamics of ufmylation.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Chelation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ by Hexadentate Polyimidazole Ligands: Modeling Metal Binding by Calprotectin Site 2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective binding of manganese(II) ions is a challenging problem with potential biomedical applications. We have designed a series of bioinspired hexadentate chelating ligands that allow for systematic, sterically&#8208;controlled tuning of the ligand cavity size in order to explore the feasibility of size&#8208;based selectivity for Mn2+ binding over other first&#8208;row divalent transition metal ions.







Abstract
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of ligands that bind Mn2+ with high affinity and selectivity, but this remains a difficult challenge. It has been proposed that the cavity size of the binding pocket is a critical factor in most synthetic and biological examples of selective Mn2+ binding. Here, we use a bioinspired approach adapted from the hexahistidine binding site of the manganese&#8208;sequestering protein calprotectin to systematically study the effect of cavity size on Mn2+ and Zn2+ binding. We have designed a hexadentate, trisimidazole ligand whose cavity size can be tuned through peripheral modification of the steric bulk of the imidazole substituents. Conformational dynamics and redox potentials of the complexes are dependent on ligand steric bulk. Stability constants are consistent with the hypothesis that larger ligand cavities are relatively favorable for Mn2+ over Zn2+, but this effect alone may not be sufficient to achieve Mn2+ selectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of ligands that bind Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with high affinity and selectivity, but this remains a difficult challenge. It has been proposed that the cavity size of the binding pocket is a critical factor in most synthetic and biological examples of selective Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding. Here, we use a bioinspired approach adapted from the hexahistidine binding site of the manganese-sequestering protein calprotectin to systematically study the effect of cavity size on Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding. We have designed a hexadentate, trisimidazole ligand whose cavity size can be tuned through peripheral modification of the steric bulk of the imidazole substituents. Conformational dynamics and redox potentials of the complexes are dependent on ligand steric bulk. Stability constants are consistent with the hypothesis that larger ligand cavities are relatively favorable for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; over Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but this effect alone may not be sufficient to achieve Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Arylation of Dithiophene&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene: Tuneable Electronic Properties and 2D Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Networks at the Solid/Liquid Interface

Herein we report the direct C&#8722;H arylation of dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with different groups. The self&#8208;assembly of DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied by using scanning tunnelling microscopy, which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface.







Abstract
Tetrathiafulvalene is among the best known building blocks in molecular electronics due to its outstanding electron&#8208;donating and redox properties. Among its derivatives, dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) has attracted considerable interest in organic electronics, owing to its high field&#8208;effect mobility. Herein, we report the direct C&#8722;H arylation of DT&#8208;TTF to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups in order to evaluate their influence on the electronic properties by cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Self&#8208;assembly of the DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied by using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface. The tetrabenzoic acid derivative can attain a planar geometry on the graphite surface due to van der Waals interactions with the surface and H&#8208;bonding with neighbouring molecules. This study demonstrates a simple method for the synthesis of arylated DT&#8208;TTF derivatives towards the design and construction of novel &#960;&#8208;extended electroactive frameworks.

         <title>Formate Additive for Efficient and Stable Methylammonium&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells by Gas&#8208;Quenching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>

Formate addtives play a critical role in regulating the crystal growth and orientation of MA&#8208;free perovskite films prepared with gas&#8208;quenching. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94&#8201;% and improved stability without any interfacial passivation.







Abstract
In order to promote the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, gas&#8208;quenching is considered to be a promising technique for perovskite film fabrication. However, when handling with methylammonium&#8208;free (MA&#8208;free) perovskites, it is often difficult to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films by gas&#8208;quenching. Herein, formate additives are employed to regulate the crystallization of MA&#8208;free perovskite, and improve the quality of perovskite films. Different additives of formamidine formate (FAFO) and potassium formate (KFO) is compared to investigate the role of formate groups in the crystallization of perovskite films prepared by gas&#8208;quenching. The FAFO additive facilitates the perovskite crystallization in (001) orientation whereas KFO favors for (111) orientation. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94&#8201;%, compared to that of 20.14&#8201;% for KFO devices. In addition, FAFO device also exhibits improved thermal stability in ambient condition without encapsulation, extending the T80 lifetime by 18&#8197;times compared to the pristine device.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bridge Controlled Patterning of BTR:PC71BM Bulk Heterojunction Micro Arrays towards High&#8208;Performance Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for the patterning of organic bulk heterojunctions. The fabricated BTR:PC71BM micropatterns arrays have exhibited hierarchical morphology with suitable domain size, which enhanced the charge generation and transport. For this reason, the fabricated microphotodiodes presented excellent performance with a responsivity of 40.56&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 and a specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#8197;Jones.







Abstract
The patterning strategy of organic semiconductors is a crucial issue for integrated circuit. However, due to the uncontrollable liquid dewetting, most of the research is mainly focused on the patterning of single component, few works have been done on the patterning of multi&#8208;component or heterojunction, which play an important role in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, a capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for patterning of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) micro&#8208;arrays, with liquid crystalline BTR and PC71BM utilized as donor and acceptor, respectively. The BTR:PC71BM arrays presented hierarchical morphology with suitable phase separation, which contributes to the efficient charge generation and transport. Moreover, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance with the light on/off ratio greater than 2000, the responsivity of 40.57&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1, and specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#8197;Jones. Such progress demonstrates that the capillary&#8208;bridge strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality BHJ micropatterns arrays.

         <title>Deciphering the Differences in Ambident Reactivity between the Cyanate, Thiocyanate Ions, and their P&#8208; and As&#8208;Containing Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the ambident nature of the [NCX]&#8722; (X&#8201;:&#8201;O, S, Se) anions is well known, the analogous heavier P&#8208; or As&#8208;containing species are lesser explored. This computational study explores the ambident SN2 reactivities of all existing [ECX]&#8722; (E: N, P, As; X: O, S, Se) anions. The results conceptualise reactivity patterns and offer explanations on the trends so that the accessibility of unprecedented low&#8208;coordinate organopnictogen species can be proposed.







Abstract
Although the cyanate and thiocyanate anions belong to the most known textbook examples of ambident nucleophiles, the electronic factors that determine their markedly differing reactivities are still unclear. The recently discovered P&#8208; and As&#8208;containing [PCX]&#8722; and [AsCX]&#8722; analogues (X: O, S, Se), whose ambident nature is practically unexplored, may serve as ideal basis for comparison to clarify these differences. This study presents comprehensive theoretical investigations on the nucleophilic behaviours of the whole set of so far known [ECX]&#8722; (E: N, P, As, X: O, S, Se) anions, aiming for a systematic understanding of the reactivity patterns and identifying the factors that govern the nucleophilic substitutions. The results indicate that the SN2 reactions of the O&#8208;containing [ECO]&#8722; ions are thermodynamically preferred at the pnictogen centres E, while the kinetic contributions are only substantial for the N&#8208;containing [NCX]&#8722; anions. The ambident reactivities of the congeners that contain N or O significantly differ from those with P, As, S, or Se heteroatoms, in line with the inert s&#8208;orbital effect, characteristic for the heavier elements. By analysing the electronic structures and bonding patterns of the anions and relevant transition state structures, clear explanations are offered for the differing reactivities of the whole set of [ECX]&#8722; anions. To serve for synthetic investigations, possible outcomes of nucleophilic substitutions are predicted, and the target molecules are expected to be versatile and useful synthons.

By analysing the electronic structures and bonding patterns of the anions and relevant transition state structures, clear explanations are offered for the differing reactivities of the whole set of [ECX]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. To serve for synthetic investigations, possible outcomes of nucleophilic substitutions are predicted, and the target molecules are expected to be versatile and useful synthons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Latent Pronucleophiles in Lewis Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Allylation of Silyl Enol Ethers with Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of latent pronucleophiles greatly expands the scope of Lewis base catalysis and enables enantioselective allylation of silyl enol ethers setting up to two stereogenic centers in a single operation.







Abstract
Lewis base catalyzed allylations of C&#8208;centered nucleophiles have been largely limited to the niche substrates with acidic C&#8722;H substituted for C&#8722;F bonds at the stabilized carbanionic carbon. Herein we report that the concept of latent pronucleophiles serves to overcome these limitations and allow for a variety of common stabilized C&#8208;nucleophiles, when they are introduced as the corresponding silylated compounds, to undergo enantioselective allylations using allylic fluorides. The reactions of silyl enol ethers afford the allylation products in good yields and with high degree of regio/stereoselectivity as well as diastereoselectivity when cyclic silyl enol ethers are used. Further examples of silylated stabilized carbon nucleophiles that undergo efficient allylation speak in favor of the general applicability of this concept to C&#8208;centered nucleophiles.

         <title>Photothermal Perylene Bisimide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>

In this paper, perylene bisimide gels are prepared that can exhibit the photothermal effect. This can be used for example to heat a solution above the gel.







Abstract
Gels formed using a perylene bisimide (PBI) as a low molecular weight gelator can show the photothermal effect. Formation of the PBI radical anion results in new absorption bands forming, meaning that subsequent irradiation with a wavelength of light overlapping with the new absorption band leads to heating of the gel. This approach can be used to heat the gel, as well as the surrounding milieu. We show how we can use electrochemical methods as well as multicomponent systems to form the radical anion without the need for UV light, and how we can use the photothermal effect to induce phase transitions in the solutions above the gels by exploiting photothermal behavior.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Enamides by Hydrogen Atom Transfer Alkene Isomerization Using Dual Cobalt/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of polysubstituted enamides via metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer by merger of cobalt/photoredox catalysis was achieved. The judicious choice of Co(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;CF3&#8208;salophen) and Co(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalophen) enabled access to polysubstituted enamides. The method tolerated haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non&#8208;protected indoles, and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
M&#8208;HAT isomerization is a highly reliable method to access thermodynamically stable alkenes with high functional group tolerance. However, synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes by M&#8208;HAT isomerization reaction is still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enamide synthesis using M&#8208;HAT via a combination of cobalt and photoredox catalysis. This method tolerates a variety of functional groups including haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non&#8208;protected indoles, and drug derivatives. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and E/Z selectivity.

         <title>Massively Parallel Double&#8208;Selection Workflow for the Evolution of Molecular Switches Based on Surface&#8208;Display in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Lpp&#8208;ompA surface&#8208;display system is used for the selection of riboswitches in E. coli. Cells are either selected through their ability to bind to magnetic beads or counter&#8208;selected by the deleterious effects of the surface&#8208;display system overexpression. This dual selection system is massively parallel and allows accelerating the screening process required for the evolution of molecular switches from vast libraries.







Abstract
Microbial surface display of proteins is a versatile method for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Herein, the use of a surface display system in E. coli for the evolution of a riboswitch from an RNA aptamer is presented. To this end, a streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide (SBP) is displayed at the bacterial surface, which can be used for massively parallel selection using a magnetic separation system. Coupling gene expression from a riboswitch library to the display of SBP hence allows selection of library members that express strongly in the presence of a ligand. As excessive SBP expression leads to bacterial growth inhibition, it can be used to negatively select against leaky riboswitches expressing in the absence of ligand. Based on this principle, we devise a double selection workflow that enables quick selection of functional riboswitches with a comparatively low screening workload. The efficiency of our protocol by re&#8208;discovering a previously isolated theophylline riboswitch from a library was demonstrated, as well as a new riboswitch that is similar in performance, but slightly more responsive at low theophylline concentrations. Our workflow is massively parallel and can be applied to the screening or pre&#8208;screening of large molecular libraries.

         <title>New Hypothesis Insight of Structural Properties on Four Tau Peptide Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease: Origin from the Histidine Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural properties and aggregation tendency of four Tau peptide fragments are subject to significant modulation by histidine behaviors, including its tautomeric and protonation states. Notably, the R1, R2, and R4 fragments exhibit a preference for unstable and flexible structural features, whereas only R3(&#1013;&#948;) displays a propensity for stable three &#946;&#8208;strand structures.







Abstract
During protein folding and misfolding, structural properties and aggregation tendency can be significantly influenced by histidine behaviors (tautomeric behaviors and protonation behaviors). The original reasons were derived from the net charge changes and the various N/N&#8722;H orientation on imidazole rings. In the current study, total 18 independent REMD simulations were performed to investigate the histidine behaviors on four Tau peptide fragments (MBD, including R1, R2, R3, and R4 fragments). We found that, compared to R1, R2, R3 except (&#1013;&#948;), and R4 systems with flexible structural features, only R3(&#1013;&#948;) has dominating conformational structure (possibility of 81.3&#8201;%) with three &#946;&#8208;strand structures in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures at I4&#8208;K6 and I24&#8208;H26, as well as antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at G19&#8208;L21. Importantly, the H25 and H26 residues (in R3(&#1013;&#948;) system) are directly involved in the sheet structure formations and strong H&#8208;bonded interactions (possibility range of 31.3&#8201;%&#8211;44.7&#8201;%). Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#1013;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.

The original reasons were derived from the net charge changes and the various N/N&#8722;H orientation on imidazole rings. In the current study, total 18 independent REMD simulations were performed to investigate the histidine behaviors on four Tau peptide fragments (MBD, including R1, R2, R3, and R4 fragments). We found that, compared to R1, R2, R3 except (&#1013;&#948;), and R4 systems with flexible structural features, only R3(&#1013;&#948;) has dominating conformational structure (possibility of 81.3&#8201;%) with three &#946;-strand structures in parallel &#946;-sheet structures at I4-K6 and I24-H26, as well as antiparallel &#946;-sheet structure at G19-L21. Importantly, the H25 and H26 residues (in R3(&#1013;&#948;) system) are directly involved in the sheet structure formations and strong H-bonded interactions (possibility range of 31.3&#8201;%&#8211;44.7&#8201;%). Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#1013;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co2+ Doped Biotinylated Carbon Dot: A Theranostic Agent for Target Specific Killing of Cancer Cells via Hypoxia Induced Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting cancer cells: Biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) selectively diagnosed and killed cancer cells with marked superiority over normal cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay confirmed the increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) that has key role in hypoxia generation leading to apoptosis. In 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis.







Abstract
Conventional cancer treatments have systematic side effects that stand against its desirable therapeutic efficacy. Alternative strategies using biochemical features of cancer cells to promote apoptosis are finding notable significance. One such important biochemical feature of malignant cells is hypoxia, alteration of which can lead to cell death. Hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) has the key role in hypoxia generation. Herein, we synthesized biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) that specifically diagnose and selectively killed cancer cells with 3&#8211;3.1&#8208;fold higher efficiency over non&#8208;cancer cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay in CoCDb treated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cells confirmed the increased expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945; that was responsible for efficient killing of cancer cells. In 2D cells and 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis that make CoCDb a potential theranostic agent.

         <title>Regioselective Dehydrogenative Reverse Prenylation of Indoles with 2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient C&#8208;3 regioselective dehydrogenation reverse prenylation of indoles has been developed by use of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene as the prenylation reagent. The protocol is of atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economies.







Abstract
Bulk chemical 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene, one of the main C5 distillates of the petrochemical industry, has scarcely been utilized directly in synthesizing high&#8208;value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Herein, we use 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene as the starting material to develop a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly site&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective C&#8208;3 dehydrogenation reverse prenylation of indoles. This synthetic method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economies.

         <title>Using Solution History to Control Hydrogel Properties of a Perylene Bisimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelation: We demonstrate how one perylene bisimides gelator and one gelation trigger can form different hydrogels with different mechanical and optical properties. This is done by altering the starting pH and the history of the solution before it is gelled. This demonstrates the tunability of a single molecule using the same gelation conditions is possible, which is valuable in material design.







Abstract
pH dependence on water soluble aggregates is well&#8208;known in the field of low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs), with different aggregates sometimes having very different properties depending on their final pH. This aggregation determines their applications and performance. Here, we investigate the pH dependence of perylene bisimide gels; initially solutions are formed at a high pH and gels form as the pH is decreased. We find it is not only the final pH but also the starting pH that can impact the resulting gel. We use small angle neutron scattering (SANS), rheology, 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy to examine the effect of starting pH on gelation kinetics and final gel properties. Adjusting the solution from pH&#8197;9 (where there are few or no aggregates) to pH&#8197;6 results in the formation of different worm&#8208;like micelles than the ones directly formed at pH&#8197;6, leading to again gels with different mechanical properties. This work highlights the importance of controlling the pH of solutions before gelation, but also opens up more possible morphologies and therefore more properties from the same molecule.

         <title>Base&#8208;Triggered Oxidative Addition to Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P&#8208;chelation assisted strategy to promote oxidative addition of C(sp2)&#8722;I bonds to gold has been extended to secondary phosphine oxides, but in contrast with related phosphines, a base (NEt3, K2CO3) is needed. Back&#8208;donation prevails over donation in such oxidative additions. The reaction gives access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes whose SPO moiety can be chemically derivatized.







Abstract
The coordination of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) was shown to efficiently promote the activation of C(sp2)&#8722;I bonds by gold, as long as a base is added (NEt3, K2CO3). These transformations stand as a new type of chelation&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to gold. The role of the base and the influence of the electronic properties of the P&#8208;ligand were analyzed computationally. Accordingly, the oxidative addition was found to be dominated by Au&#8594;(Ar&#8722;I) backdonation. In this case, gold behaves similarly to palladium, suggesting that the inverse electron flow reported previously (with prevailing (Ar&#8722;I)&#8594;Au donation, resulting in faster reactions of electron&#8208;enriched substrates) is a specific feature of electron&#8208;deficient cationic gold(I) complexes. The reaction gives straightforward access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes. The possibility to chemically derivatize the SPO moiety at Au(III) was substantiated by protonation and silylation reactions.

An isoguanosine&#8208;visualized mechano&#8208;responsive supramolecular self&#8208;assembly (isoG&#8208;VMRSS) system was successfully constructed by a simple one&#8208;pot reaction. It is formed by metastable boronate ester bonds, metal coordination bonds and hydrogen bonds, which allows for 9 times mechano&#8208;responsive releases of isoG and ultimately shows potential in ultrasound drug release.







Abstract
The mechano&#8208;responsiverelease of small molecules has received extensive attention in ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled drug release in recent years because it can achieve non&#8208;invasive, spatiotemporally controlled precise drug release. However, the vast majority of small molecules mechano&#8208;release reported so far are based on polymer systems, which suffer from complex preparations and single mechano&#8208;response. Here, an isoguanosine (isoG) visualized mechano&#8208;responsive supramolecular self&#8208;assembly (isoG&#8208;VMRSS) system was successfully constructed by a one&#8208;pot reaction. It is completely composed of small molecules, which allows for multiple mechano&#8208;responsive releases of isoG (at least 9&#8197;times) and ultimately has potential for application in US drug release. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach reveals the supramolecular network structure (formed by the joint action of related metal coordination bonds, boronate ester bonds and hydrogen bonds mediated by isoG) gradually formed inside the system is the underlying internal mechanism. Therefore, it provides a new and effective idea of small molecule release in the field of mechanochemistry.

Cyclization: A mild, room temperature oxidative cyclization of 2&#8208;substituted anilines that accesses a broad range of medium&#8208;ring N&#8208;heterocycles via radical intermediates is reported.







Abstract
The development of an efficient process that produces bioactive medium&#8208;sized N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds from 2&#8208;substituted anilines using either iodosobenzene or (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)&#8208;benzene is reported. The tether between the sulfonamide and the aryl group can be varied to access dihydroacridine&#8208;, dibenzazepine&#8208;, or dibenzazocine scaffolds. While substitution on the aniline portion is limited to electron&#8208;neutral&#8208; or electron&#8208;poor groups, a broader range of functional groups are tolerated on the ortho&#8208;aryl substituent and site selective C&#8722;NAr bond formation can be achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that medium&#8208;ring formation occurs via radical reactive intermediates.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical C&#8722;N Coupling of Amides with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical C&#8722;N coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl halides with amides using NiCl2&#8208;bipyridine complex as a pre&#8208;catalyst in the absence of an external photocatalyst is reported, allowing a broad array of aryl chlorides to be converted into the corresponding (hetero)arylamides.







Abstract
This paper reports a photochemical C&#8722;N coupling of abundant, but less reactive aryl chlorides, with structurally diverse primary and secondary amides by Ni&#8208;mediated without an external photocatalyst. Under the irradiation of light (390&#8211;395&#8197;nm) with a soluble organic amine as the base, the reaction allows for the successful transformation of (hetero)aryl chlorides to a wide range of N&#8208;aryl amides. More than 60&#8197;examples are shown, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of this protocol in organic synthesis. Mechanic studies indicate that this amidation proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(III) catalytic cycle.

Single&#8208;molecule magnets: The first examples of germole&#8208;ligated lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets are reported, with markedly different properties found for the dysprosium and erbium versions.







Abstract
The first germole&#8208;ligated single&#8208;molecule magnets are reported, with contrasting properties found for the near&#8208;linear sandwich complexes [(&#951;8&#8208;COT)Ln(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe]&#8722;, where Ln=Dy (1Dy) or Er (1Er), COT is cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl and CpGe is [GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;. Whereas 1Er has an energy barrier of 120(1)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in zero applied field and open hysteresis loops up to 10&#8197;K, the relaxation in 1Dy is characterized by quantum tunneling within the ground state.

         <title>Room Temperature Hydroxyl Group&#8208;Assisted Preparation of Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adjustable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework UiO&#8208;66 Composites: Towards Continuous Oil Collection and Emulsion Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
An effective post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8722;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid is vital for the hydrophobic modification. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for continuous oil collection and emulsion separation by coating modified UiO&#8208;66 on porous substrates.







Abstract
Developing a straightforward and effective hydrophobic modification for metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) under mild conditions is meaningful for MOF applications. Here, a post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8722;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) is the vital force for the modifier TDPA. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for efficient oil&#8208;water separation by coating TDPA&#8208;modified UiO&#8208;66 (P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) on commercial melamine sponges (MS) and filter papers (FP) with water contact angles of 153.2&#176; and 155.6&#176;, respectively. The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS composite could quickly and selectively absorb oily liquids up to 43&#8197;times its weight from water. The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS achieved continuous oil collection with high separation efficiencies (&#8805;99.4&#8201;%). In addition, P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/FP and P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS showed high separation efficiencies for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions (&#8805;98.5&#8201;%) and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, respectively, with high resistance to low/high temperatures and acid/base conditions. The metal hydroxyl group&#8208;assisted post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy offers a facile and broad way to prepare hydrophobic MOFs for promising applications in environmental fields.

Unleashing the power of peptide hydrogels for environmental remediation: This is a tale of an ultrashort peptide hydrogel (azo&#8208;KC) and its efficiency for wastewater treatment. The hydrogel is the outcome of the cumulative efforts of covalent and noncovalent interactions providing unique features like thixotropy and insolubility in bulk water medium. Dye contamination from textile industries is a severe concern for water pollution, and this crosslinked 3D fibrous hydrogel has been implemented as a promising way to efficiently address such wastewater challenges. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Ahmed, B. Pramanik and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300312). Various elements in this picture were designed by Freepik.

Pick any color of electrochrome: Sensors, photovoltaic cells, non&#8208;volatile memories, tintable glass etc.&#8212;all of these technologies include thiophene&#8208;based materials. They need to be tailor&#8208;made, and therefore customization and modularization is highly desirable. We have synthesized a kit of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones, carefully investigated their optoelectronic properties and uncovered their structure&#8211;property relationships. The absorption of the heterophenoquinones covers the entire visible spectrum (structure and hexagons at the front). Upon reduction they change their color (structure and hexagons at the back), thus making them applicable in tintable glass. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Freudenberg, U.&#8197;H.&#8197;F. Bunz and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203862).

         <title>Structural Self&#8208;Assembly and Applications of Metal&#8211;Organic Molecular Containers with Flexible Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic molecular containers (MOMCs), constructed with flexible backbones, exhibit a unique feature both in the structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the functional groups in the skeletons. This Review focuses on the recent development of flexible MOMCs from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications, which remains a fertile ground for opportunity and creativity.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has become an interdisciplinary discipline of chemistry, physics, and biology. As a huge subunit of supramolecular compounds, the functional metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems with well&#8208;defined cavities which are able to accommodate size&#8208;suitable guests via benign host&#8208;guest behavior, have been known as &#8220;metal&#8211;organic molecular containers&#8221; (MOMCs) and attracted much attentions for their rich chemical properties and wide potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, bio&#8208;medical and other fields. In particular, the MOMCs with flexible backbones exhibit a unique feature both in the aspect of structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the specific functional groups in the skeletons. In this paper, we review several selected examples of the coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications. The self&#8208;assembly strategies, especially the different choice of organic ligands with flexible backbones during the construction, leading to quite diverse configurations compared to the rigid ligands, have been also discussed to show a different perspective of metal&#8211;organic system construction.

         <title>18F&#8208;Labeling Chemistry in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 37, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct incorporation of 18F into target molecules of interest in aqueous media has many practical advantages. This paper classifies the atoms that form covalent bonds with fluorine and reviews the existing methods for 18F&#8208;labeling in aqueous media. Additionally, some 18F&#8208;labeling mechanisms are explained.







Abstract
18F&#8208;Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. The preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled molecular tracers involves critical steps such as the 18F&#8208;labeling reaction, work&#8208;up, and 18F&#8208;product purification, which are governed by 18F&#8208;labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of 18F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this Review summarizes the existing 18F&#8208;labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. The Review is focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [18F]F&#8722; as the 18F source has been mainly discussed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The direct incorporation of&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;F into target molecules&lt;/b&gt; of interest in aqueous media has many practical advantages. This paper classifies the atoms that form covalent bonds with fluorine and reviews the existing methods for &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeling in aqueous media. Additionally, some &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeling mechanisms are explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. The preparation of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeled molecular tracers involves critical steps such as the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeling reaction, work-up, and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-product purification, which are governed by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this Review summarizes the existing &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. The Review is focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F source has been mainly discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereo&#8208;controlled Synthesis of Vicinal Tertiary Carbinols: Application in the Synthesis of Zaragozic Acid, Pactamycin and Ryanodol Core Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a novel and flexible approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols. The developed strategy featured a highly diastereoselective singlet&#8208;oxygen (O21) [4+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed cyclohexadienones (derived from oxidative dearomatization of the corresponding carboxylic&#8208;acid appended phenol precursors), followed by programmed &#8220;O&#8208;O&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8208;C&#8221; bond cleavage. In doing so, a highly functionalized and versatile intermediate was identified and prepared in synthetically useful quantity as a plausible precursor to access a variety of designed and naturally occurring vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Most notably, the developed strategy was successfully applied in the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Polydopamine on ZnCo2O4 Nanowire to Facilitate Urea Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dealing with overcoming the sluggishness of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) existed. ZnCo2O4, an excellent OER electrocatalyst, its application towards UOR is studied with surface&#8208;grown polydopamine (PDA). ZnCo2O4@PDA is produced over the surface of nickel foam by hydrothermal method followed by self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride. Dopamine hydrochloride was varied in solution mixture to study the optimal growth of PDA necessary to enhance electrochemical activity. Hence, prepared ZnCo2O4@PDA is characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electronic structural, and morphology/microstructure studies for confirmation. With successful confirmation, the developed electrode material is applied towards UOR and ZnCo2O4@ PDA&#8208;1.5, delivering an excellent low overpotential of 80 mV @ 20 mA/cm2 in the electrolyte mixture of 1 M potassium hydroxide + 0.33 M urea. Also, to support excellent UOR activity, other electrochemical properties such as tafel slope, electrochemical surface active sites, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are studied. Further, a schematic illustration explaining the UOR mechanism is shown to clearly understand the obtained electrochemical activity. Finally, urea water electrolysis is carried out in a two&#8208;electrode symmetrical cell and compared with water electrolysis. This clearly shows the potential of the developed material for efficient electrochemical hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkylcyanoborate Anions: Building Blocks for Fluorine&#8208;Free Low Viscosity, Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of mixed&#8208;substituted potassium alkylcyano&#8208; and alkylcyanofluoroborates has been synthesized using easily accessible starting compounds and characterized by elemental analysis, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. In addition, single&#8208;crystal structures of salts of the cyanoborate anions have been derived from X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids ([EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs) with the new borate anions have been synthesized and their physicochemical properties, i.e. high thermal and electrochemical stability, low viscosity, and high conductivity, have been compared to the properties of related [EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs. The influence of the different alkyl substituents at boron has been assessed. The exemplary study on the properties with the [EMIm]+&#8208;ILs with the mixed water stable&#160;alkylcyanoborate anions points towards the potential of these fluorine&#8208;free borate anions, in general.</dc:description>

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. In this work, we combine an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. We report the highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Pathway for Synthesis of Ketone from Aldehyde and Sulfonylhydrazone: Is Diazo the Key Intermediate?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new pathway via a cyclic intermediate for synthesis of ketone from aldehyde and sulfonylhydrazone derivative under base condition was proposed by performing several control experiments along with analyzing the mass spectra and in situ IR of the reaction mixture. Inspired by the new mechanism, an efficient and scalable method for homologation of aldehydes to ketones has been developed. The wide variety of target ketones were obtained in yields of 42&#8208;95% by simply heating the 3&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)benzene sulfonylhydrazones (3&#8208;(Tfsyl)hydrazone) with aldehydes at 110 &#176;C in 2 hours with K2CO3&#160;and DMSO as base and solvent, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is reported. The developed protocol provided 35&#8211;70% yield of maleimide&#8208;derived cyclobutenyl boronates and demonstrated wide compatibility with various functional groups. The synthetic utility of the prepared building blocks was demonstrated for a range of transformations, including Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, catalytic or metal&#8208;hydride reduction, oxidation, and cycloaddition reactions. With aryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl boronates, the products of double [2+2] cycloaddition were obtained predominantly. Using the developed protocol, a cyclobutene&#8208;derived analogue of Thalidomide was prepared in one step. Mechanistic studies supported the participation of the triplet&#8208;excited state maleimides and ground state alkynyl boronates in the key step of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted One Pot Cascade Conversion of Furfural to &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over Sc(OTf)3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) is considered as a star biochemical which can be used as a green solvent, fuel additive and versatile organic intermediate. In this study, metal triflate (M(OTf)n) was utilized as the catalyst for one&#8208;pot transformation of furfural (FF) to GVL in alcohol media under microwave irradiation. Alcohol plays multiple functions including solvent, hydrogen donor and alcoholysis reagent in this cascade reaction process. And process efficiency of GVL production from FF upgrading is strongly related to the effective charge density of selected catalyst and the reduction potential of selected alcohol. Complex (OTf)n&#8208;M&#8208;O(H)R, presenting both Br&#248;nsted acid and Lewis acid, is the real catalytic active species in this cascade reaction process. Among various catalysts, Sc(OTf)3 exhibited the best catalytic activity for GVL production. Various reaction parameters including the Sc(OTf)3 amount, reaction temperature and time were optimized by the response surface methodology with the central composite design (RSM&#8208;CCD). Up to 81.2% GVL yield and 100% FF conversion were achieved at 143.9 oC after 8.1 h in the presence of 0.16 mmol catalyst. This catalyst exhibits high reusability and can be regenerated by oxidative degradation of humins. In addition, a plausible cascade reaction network was proposed based on the distribution of product.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Carbon Nano&#8208;Test Tubes as a Container for Concentrated DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) with an inner and outer diameter of about 25 and 35 nm, respectively, were prepared by the template technique and then their inner carbon surface was selectively oxidized to introduce carboxy groups. The adsorption behavior of DNA molecules on the oxidized CNTTs (Ox&#8208;CNTTs) was examined in the presence of Ca2+ cations. Many DNA molecules are attracted to the inner space of Ox&#8208;CNTTs based on the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA phosphate groups and carboxylate anions on the inner carbon surface. Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox&#8208;CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox&#8208;CNTTs works well as a nano&#8208;container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent&#160;Advances&#160;in Aerobic Oxidative of&#160;C&#8208;H Bond by Molecular Oxygen Focus on Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic oxidative cross coupling represents one of the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic methods for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X = N, O, S, or P) bonds using air as a sustainable external oxidant. The oxidative coupling of C&#8208;H bonds in heterocyclic compounds can effectively increase their molecular complexity by introducing new functional groups through C&#8208;H bond activation, or by formation of new heterocyclic structures through cascade construction of two or more sequential chemical bonds. This is very useful as it can increase the potential applications of these structures in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and functional materials. This is a representative overview of recent progress since 2010 on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8208;H bond using O2 or air as internal&#160;oxidant focus on Heterocycles. It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.</dc:description>

It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium molecules derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries.







Abstract
N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium frameworks derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries. A molecular database including the structure and the one&#8208;electron standard reduction potential of related pyridinium derivatives has been generated using a computational protocol that combines semiempirical and DFT quantum chemical methods. The predicted reduction potentials span a broad range for the investigated pyridinium frameworks, but pyridoxal derivatives, particularly those involving electron withdrawing substituents, have potentials compatible with the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes. The stability of radicals formed upon one&#8208;electron reduction has been analyzed by a new computational tool proposed recently for large&#8208;scale computational screening.

         <title>Orthogonal Strategies for Profiling Potential Cellular Targets of Anandamide and Cannabidiol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) and &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) platforms have been used to identify potential cellular targets of cannabinoids, especially cannabidiol (CBD), leading to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation led to the conclusion that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.







Abstract
The human endocannabinoid system regulates a myriad of physiological processes through a complex lipid signaling network involving cannabinoids and their respective receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB1R) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R). Anandamide (AEA) and cannabidiol (CBD) are classical examples of cannabinoids that elicit a variety of effects, both beneficial and detrimental, through these receptors. Mounting evidence suggested the presence of other potential cannabinoid targets that may be responsible for other observable effects. However, prior pharmacological studies on these cannabinoid compounds provided scant evidence of direct engagement to these proposed targets. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no chemoproteomic studies have been demonstrated on CBD. Here we showed that, by taking advantage of a recently developed &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) approach, we have identified several new putative targets of both AEA and CBD. Comparison of these interaction landscapes with those obtained from well&#8208;established affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) platforms has led to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation of selected proteins led us to conclude that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.

         <title>From Terminal to Spiro&#8208;Phosphonium Acceptors, Remarkable Moieties to Develop Polyaromatic NIR Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy absorption and emission were realized in a series of anthracene&#8208;derived donor&#8208;acceptor phosphonium dyes. The electron deficiency of the rare phospha&#8208;spiro architecture allowed to achieve fluorescence at 797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and at 860&#8197;nm in the solid state.







Abstract
Phosphonium&#8208;based compounds gain attention as promising photofunctional materials. As a contribution to the emerging field, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor ionic dyes, which were constructed by tailoring phosphonium (A) and extended &#960;&#8208;NR2 (D) fragments to an anthracene framework. The alteration of the &#960;&#8208;spacer of electron&#8208;donating substituents in species with terminal &#8722;+PPh2Me groups exhibits a long absorption wavelength up to &#955;abs=527&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and shifted the emission to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (&#955;=805&#8197;nm for thienyl aniline donor), although at low quantum yield (&#934;&lt;0.01). In turn, the introduction of a P&#8208;heterocyclic acceptor substantially narrowed the optical bandgap and improved the efficiency of fluorescence. In particular, the phospha&#8208;spiro moiety allowed to attain NIR emission (797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane) with fluorescence efficiency as high as &#934;=0.12. The electron&#8208;accepting property of the phospha&#8208;spiro constituent outperformed that of the monocyclic and terminal phosphonium counterparts, illustrating a promising direction in the design of novel charge&#8208;transfer chromophores.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria through Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine&#8211;aryl acetylene conjugates (pink) accumulate in the mitochondria of cancer cells, where the elevated pH and reactive oxygen species (white) levels allow the formation of thiyl radicals (yellow glowing pin and first arrow) from thiols (dark yellow pin). The activation enables radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling of biomolecules to the dye&#8211;alkyne conjugate (second arrow). This represents a powerful tool for the selective targeting of cancerous mitochondria through physicochemical accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Mokhir, M.&#8197;R. Heinrich and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301340).

         <title>Flexible self&#8208;powered energy systems based on H2O/Ni2+ intercalated NixV2O5&#8901;nH2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable electronic devices has created greater demands for multifunctional energy integration systems. Self&#8208;powered systems have gained widespread interest because they can collect and storage renewable environmental energy and provide stable electricity to electronic devices. Herein, we developed a flexible self&#8208;charging energy system, involving textile&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZIHC) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which demonstrates wearable, compatibility, lightweight and can quickly harvest and store energy. NixV2O5&#8901;nH2O (NVO) loaded on carbon cloth (CC) with Ni2+/H2O ions intercalated as the cathode was assembled with activated CC to form a ZIHC, which has a voltage range of 2.0 V and capacitance value of 267.1 mF cm&#8208;2 as well as good charge and discharge rates and excellent cycling stability. At the same time, the NVO/CC can be assembled with PDMS to form a TENG achieving a maximum instantaneous power of 18.5mW cm&#8208;2. The device can be flexibly worn over the body to continuously harvest and store biomechanical energy and charge the electronic wristwatch successfully. This work demonstrates great convenience and promising practical applications as sustainable flexible energy system for portable electronic devices.</dc:description>

Abstract
Low band gap materials have always been a focus of attention due to their potential applications in various fields. In this work, a series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) compounds with fluorenylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene (FYT) skeleton were facially synthesized, which were modified with different substituents (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;SMe). The FYT core exhibit twisted C=C bond with dihedral angles around 30&#176;, and the introduction of &#8722;SMe group can provide additional S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interaction between molecules, which is conducive to the charge transporting. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra, electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that these compounds have relatively narrow band gaps, particularly, the &#8722;SMe modified compounds have slightly lower HOMO and Fermi energy levels than that of the &#8722;OMe modified compounds. Furthermore, PSCs devices were fabricated with the three compounds as HTMs, and FYT&#8208;DSDPA exhibit the best performance among them, revealing the fine&#8208;tuning band structure could influence properties of HTMs.

         <title>Effect of Flexible Spacer and Alkyl Tail Length on the Liquid Crystalline Phase Behavior of Fullerene Block Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superlattice containing 3 hydrocarbon single layers alternating with 4 fullerene 2D crystals can be generated in a wide range of fullerene block molecules (n=10 or 12; m=5&#8211;7), owing to the cooperative effect of a long spacer and short terminal tails. This offers a practical way to construct unconventional semi&#8208;conductive superstructures.







Abstract
Here the supramolecular liquid crystalline (LC) phase behavior of a series of fullerene block molecules was investigated regarding spacer length, alkyl tail length and temperature. These compounds exhibit several lamellar LC phases with different packings of self&#8208;organized fullerene two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals. With a short hexamethylene spacer, they form sandwich&#8208;like structures with triple or quadruple fullerene layers. By increasing the spacer length to 10 or 12 carbons, a composite layers&#8208;in&#8208;lamella superlattice structure with alternating soft hydrocarbon single layers and fullerene single or double layers was obtained. As the molecular configurational freedom between incompatible moieties was enhanced by the elongated spacer, the required cross&#8208;sectional fullerene&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon ratio for the superlattice could be achieved despite of different volume fractions of the blocks. The superlattice phase range is efficiently widened by the design principle of constructing LC molecules with a long spacer, which also provides a facile way to tailor novel superstructures.

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Toluene Oxidation through a Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde photochemically is described. A series of copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. The copper(II) complexes obtained after oxidation were photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously.







Abstract
A method is described to photochemically oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. As a result, a &#8220;dioxygen adduct&#8221; copper complex, for example, a peroxido complex, is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously. The ligand tris(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)amine (tmpa) led to the highest conversion rates.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Catalyzed RNA Ligation within Prebiotically Plausible Model Protocells
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ribozyme capable of functioning at low Mg2+ concentrations catalyzes efficient template&#8208;directed ligation of RNA substrates inside a prebiotically plausible fatty acid protocell. Compartmentalized RNA assembly catalyzed by ribozymes is central to the viability of spontaneously evolving protocells.







Abstract
Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg2+ at the concentrations required for ribozyme function. Here, we report a ribozyme that catalyzes template&#8208;directed RNA ligation at low Mg2+ concentrations and thus remains active within stable vesicles. Ribose and adenine, both prebiotically relevant molecules, were found to greatly reduce Mg2+&#8208;induced RNA leakage from vesicles. When we co&#8208;encapsulated the ribozyme, substrate, and template within fatty acid vesicles, we observed efficient RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation upon subsequent addition of Mg2+. Our work shows that RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA assembly can occur efficiently within prebiotically plausible fatty acid vesicles and represents a step toward the replication of primordial genomes within self&#8208;replicating protocells.

         <title>Turning the Imidazole Core into Three&#8208;Dimensional Ring Systems: Mild Organocatalytic Entry to Enantiopure 6,7&#8208;Dihydrobenzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenging side of simplicity: Easily available imidazole&#8208;based substrates were coupled with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals via eliminative [4+2] cycloaddition under mild aminocatalytic conditions to access rare chiral [d]&#8208;fused imidazole ring systems with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity and good potential for post&#8208;cycloaddition functional group editing.







Abstract
Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in&#8197;situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho&#8208;quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane&#8208;fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d]imidazoles with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivities. Post&#8208;cycloaddition chemical editing provided imidazole&#8208;based ring systems with diverse oxidation state and functional groups.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The challenging side of simplicity&lt;/b&gt;: Easily available imidazole-based substrates were coupled with &#946;-aryl enals via eliminative [4+2] cycloaddition under mild aminocatalytic conditions to access rare chiral [&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]-fused imidazole ring systems with optimal enantio- and regioselectivity and good potential for post-cycloaddition functional group editing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in&#8197;situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane-fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzo-fused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;-aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7-dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]imidazoles with optimal enantio- and regioselectivities. Post-cycloaddition chemical editing provided imidazole-based ring systems with diverse oxidation state and functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal&#8208;assisted etching of nickel foam for the collectively exhaustive electrochemical performance of oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal, violet&#8208;crystal (VC), was used to etch the nickel foam (NF) to fabricate a self&#8208;standing electrode for the water oxidation reaction. The efficacy of VC&#8208;assisted etching manifests the promising electrochemical performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring only ~356 and ~376 mV overpotentials to reach 50 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. The OER activity improvement is attributed to the collectively exhaustive effects arising from the incorporation of various elements in the NF, and the enhancement of active site density. Furthermore, the self&#8208;standing electrode is robust, exhibiting a stable OER activity after 4,000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, and ~ 50 h. The anodic transfer coefficients (aa) show that the first electron transfer step is the rate&#8208;determining step on the surface of NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 (NF etched by 1 g of VCs) electrode, while the chemical step involving dissociation following the first electron transfer step is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step in other electrodes. The lowest Tafel slope value observed in the NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 electrode indicates the high surface coverage of oxygen intermediates and more favorable OER reaction kinetics, as confirmed by high interfacial chemical capacitance and low charge transport/interfacial resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphdiyne and its Composites for Lithium&#8208;Ion and Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphynes (GYs) are a novel type of carbon allotrope composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, boasting both a planar conjugated structure akin to graphene and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. Graphdiyne (GDY), the first member of GYs family, has gained much interest due to its fascinating electrochemical properties including a greater theoretical capacity, high charge mobility and advanced electronic transport properties, making it a promising material for energy storage applications for lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage. Various methods, including heteroatom substitution, embedding, strain, and nanomorphology control, have been employed to further enhance the energy storage performance of GDY. Despite the potential of GDY in energy storage applications, there are still challenges to overcome in scaling up mass production. This review summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and application of GDY in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage, highlighting the obstacles faced in large&#8208;scale commercial application of GDY&#8208;based energy storage devices. Suggestions on possible solutions to overcome these hurdles have also been provided. Overall, the unique properties of GDY make it a promising material for energy storage applications in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices. The findings presented here will inspire further development of energy storage devices utilizing GDY.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivation of Solid&#8208;State Fluorescence through Controllable Intermolecular [2+2] Photodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization provides a distinctive approach to construct photoresponsive fluorescent materials in a manner of switching on solid&#8208;state fluorescence. Herein, we report efficient photoactivation of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence based on controllable intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide (BTO) derivatives, which provides a simple and effective way to construct smart photoresponsive solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials. Rational choice of substituent in BTO molecular skeleton enables them to efficiently undergo photodimerization through regulating molecular stacking in crystal, and also leads to photoactivation of solid&#8208;state fluorescence due to the generation of brightly fluorescent photodimers. This intermolecular photodimerization reaction also offers an effective method to synthesize photostable AIEgens with purely through&#8208;space conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Investigation of Intercellular Heterogeneity via Multiple Photocaged Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercellular heterogeneity occurs widely under both normal physiological environments and abnormal disease&#8208;causing conditions. Several attempts to couple spatiotemporal information to cell states in a microenvironment were performed to decipher the cause and effect of heterogeneity. Furthermore, spatiotemporal manipulation can be achieved with the use of photocaged/photoactivatable molecules. Here, we provide a platform to spatiotemporally analyze differential protein expression in neighboring cells by multiple photocaged probes coupled with homemade photomasks. We successfully established intercellular heterogeneity (photoactivable ROS trigger) and mapped the targets (directly ROS&#8208;affected cells) and bystanders (surrounding cells), which were further characterized by total proteomic and cysteinomic analysis. Different protein profiles were shown between bystanders and target cells in both total proteome and cysteinome. Our strategy should expand the toolkit of spatiotemporal mapping for elucidating intercellular heterogeneity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the reduction of R&#8208;EX2 (E= P, Sb) with two equiv. of KC8 in the presence of silylene (LSiR; L=PhC(NtBu)2) to give Trip&#8208;P=SiL(C6H4PPh2) (1), TerPh&#8208;P=(tBu)SiL (2) and TerPh&#8208;Sb=(tBu)SiL (3). The last (3) belongs to a new class of heavier analogues of Schiff bases (&gt;C=N&#8208;), containing a formal &gt;Si=Sb&#8208; double bond. The theoretical calculations suggest that lone pairs on the dicoordinated group&#8208;15 centers are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions resulting in pseudo&#8208;Si&#8208;P/Si&#8208;Sb multiple bonds which are highly reactive as indicated by the high first and second proton affinities.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Migratory and Cytotoxic Activities of [Ga(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato)3]: Roles of Endogenous Cu(II) and Drug&#8208;Induced Phenotypic Changes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As shown by IncuCyte Zoom imaging proliferation assays, invasive triple&#8208;negative human breast MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells treated with sub&#8208;toxic doses (5.0&#8208;20 &#956;M, 72 h) of [GaQ3] (Q = 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) caused profound morphological changes and inhibition of cell migration, which were likely due to terminal cell differentiation or similar phenotypical change. This is the first demonstration of potential use of a metal complex in differentiation anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Additionally, a trace amount of Cu(II) (0.20 &#956;M) added to the medium dramatically increased [GaQ3] cytotoxicity (IC50 ~ 2 &#956;M, 72 h) due to its partial dissociation and the action of the HQ ligand as a Cu(II) ionophore, as shown with electrospray mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy assays in the medium. Hence, cytotoxicity of [GaQ3] is strongly linked to ligand binding of essential metal ions in the medium, e.g., Cu(II). Appropriate delivery mechanisms of such complexes and their ligands could enable a powerful new triple therapeutic approach for cancer chemotherapy, including cytotoxicity against primary tumour, arrest of metastases, and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoselenium compounds. Chemistry and applications in organic synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenium, originally described as a toxin, turns out to be a crucial trace element for life that appears as selenocysteine and its dimer, selenocystine. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen with the advantage that the presence of the selenium atom confers antioxidant properties and high lipophilicity, which would increase cell membrane permeation leading to better oral bioavailability. In this article we have focused on the relevant features of the selenium atom, above all, the corresponding synthetic approaches to access a variety of organoselenium molecules along with the proposed reaction mechanisms. The preparation and biological properties of selenosugars, including selenoglycosides, selenonucleosides, selenopeptides, and other selenium&#8208;containing compounds will be treated. We have attempted to condense the most important aspects and interesting examples of the chemistry of selenium into a single article.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity Differences of Trigonal Pyramidal Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo and Iron(III)&#8208;Oxo Complexes: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental and computational studies show iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes can abstract hydrogen atoms from toluene efficiently, but thermochemically fail to do OH rebound and as such tolyl radicals are released and react separately. As a consequence iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo generate different products in a reaction with toluene.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species play critical roles in enzymatic catalysis yet their properties are still poorly understood. In this work we report a combined experimental and computational study into biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes with tight second&#8208;coordination sphere environments that restrict substrate access. The work shows that the second&#8208;coordination sphere slows the hydrogen atom abstraction step from toluene dramatically and the kinetics is zeroth order in substrate. However, the iron(II)&#8208;hydroxo that is formed has a low reduction potential and hence cannot do OH rebound favorably. The tolyl radical in solution then reacts further with alternative reaction partners. By contrast, the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species reacts predominantly through OH rebound to form alcohol products. Our studies show that the oxidation state of the metal influences reactivities and selectivities with substrate dramatically and that enzymes will likely need an iron(IV) center to catalyze C&#8722;H hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>Strong and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circular Dichroism in Helical Tetrapyrrole Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical metal complexes of tetraphenylbilatrienones (TPBT) have been selectively synthesized, and for the first time, their structure was revealed by XRD. Contrary to theoretical predictions, their 20&#8208;phenyl group points alongside the tetrapyrrole backbone, yielding a well&#8208;defined molecule with stable helicity, 800&#8197;nm ECD absorption and &#8211; if copper is coordinated &#8211; noninnocent properties.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of nickel and copper complexes of 19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;bilatrien&#8208;1&#8208;one (H2TPBT) is reported, a molecule which crystallizes as a molecular helix of one&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;quarter which turns with a 5.7&#8197;&#197; radius and a 3.2&#8197;&#197; pitch, and all 26 participating atoms are sp2&#8208;hybridized. UV/vis, ECD, ESR and cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal a strong interaction between metal and ligand and partial radical character when copper is coordinated instead of nickel. Strong ECD absorption in the 800&#8197;nm range is found which, using TD&#8208;DFT calculations as well as literature spectra, is shown to be highly tunable both by metal coordination and variation of the aryl groups in the TPBT periphery. The radical character of the ligand in Cu(TPBT) enables rapid interconversion between (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;enantiomers, possibly via intermittent breakage of a Cu&#8722;N bond. The 19&#8208;benzoyl group kinetically stabilizes enantiopure (M/P)&#8208;Ni(TPBT). The results are interpreted with regard to the application as circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors as well as to the chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) effect which is currently lacking a concise theoretical model.

         <title>EnT&#8208;Mediated Amino&#8208;Sulfonylation of Alkenes with Bifunctional Sulfonamides: Access to &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign method was developed for the economical and sustainable amino&#8208;sulfonylation of alkenes with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino sulfones are commonly found structural motifs in biologically active compounds. Herein, we report a direct photocatalyzed amino&#8208;sulfonylation reaction of alkenes for the efficicient production of important compounds by simple hydrolysis without the need for additional oxidants and reductants. In this transformation, the sulfonamides worked as bifunctional reagents, simultaneously generating sulfonyl radicals and N&#8208;centered radicals which were added to alkene in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Scaling up this reaction led to an efficient green synthesis of apremilast, one of the best&#8208;selling pharmceuticals, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the applied method. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.

         <title>Smart Temperature&#8208;Gating and Ion Conductivity Control of Grafted Anodic Aluminum Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in solid&#8208;state nanochannels development: A thermo&#8208;responsive polymer poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes grafted anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane by surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) is presented. This thermo&#8208;gated smart membrane shows a reversible surface wettability change, which allows the smart membrane to control the ion conductivity and ensures the dye release ability.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have been widely applied to porous surfaces. Permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels modified with stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, however, have been less investigated. In this work, the permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates modified with thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes are demonstrated. By surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP), PNIPAM brushes are successfully grafted onto the hexagonally packed cylindrical nanopores of AAO templates. The surface hydrophilicities of the membranes can be reversibly altered because of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of the PNIPAM polymer brushes. From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, the temperature&#8208;gating behaviors of the AAO&#8208;g&#8208;PNIPAM membranes exhibit larger impedance changes than those of the pure AAO membranes at higher temperatures because of the aggregation of the grafted PNIPAM chains. The reversible surface properties caused by the extended and collapsed states of the polymer chains are also demonstrated by dye release tests. The smart thermo&#8208;gated and ion&#8208;controlled nanoporous membranes are suitable for future smart membrane applications.

         <title>Ru(II) Complexes with Protic&#8208; and Anionic&#8208;Naked&#8208;NHC Ligands for Cooperative Activation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of ruthenium(II)&#8208;protic&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, [Ru(NNCH)(PPh3)2(X)]Cl (1, X=Cl and 2, X=H) and their deprotonated forms [Ru(NNC)(PPh3)2(X)] (1&#697;, X=Cl and 2&#697;, X=H) are reported where NNC is a new unsymmetrical pincer ligand. The four complexes are interconvertible by simple acid&#8208;base chemistry. The combined theoretical and spectroscopic investigations indicate charge segregation in anionic&#8208;NHC complexes (1&#697; and 2&#697;) and can be described from a Lewis pair perspective. The chemical reactivity of deprotonated complex 1&#697; shows cooperative small molecule activation. Complex 1&#697; activates H&#8208;H bond of hydrogen, C(sp3)&#8208;I bond of iodomethane, and C(sp)&#8208;H bond of phenylacetylene. The activation of CO2 using anionic NHC complex 1&#697; at moderate temperature and ambient pressure and subsequent conversion to formate is also described. All the new compounds have been characterized using ESI&#8208;MS, 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Molecular structures of 1, 2, and 2&#697; have also been determined with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The cooperative small molecule activation perspective broadens the scope of potential applications of anionic&#8208;NHC complexes in small molecule activation, including the conversion of carbon dioxide to formate, a much sought after reaction in the renewable energy and sustainable development domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalently modified Kevlar fabric incorporating graphene oxide with enhanced antibacterial properties and preserved strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a multi&#8208;step modification process for the covalent transformation of Kevlar fabric en route the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Spectroscopic, thermal and microscopy imgaing techniques have been employed to follow step&#8208;by&#8208;step the modification of Kevlar and the formation of the corresponding Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric. The level of Kevlar&#8217;s functionalization can be controled with the nitration time, the first reaction&#160;in the multi&#8208;sequence organic transformations, for obtaining the hybrid fabric&#160;with a content of GO up to 30%. Most importantly, the covalent post&#8208;modification of Kevlar does not occur in the expense of the other otherwise excellent mechanical properties of the fabric. Under optimal conditions, the&#160;&#160;Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric shows a 20% enhancement of the ultimate strengh. Notably, when the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric exposed to cyanobacterial&#160;Synechococcus&#160;the bacteria growth was fully inhibited. Overall, the covalently modified fabric demonstrated significant antibacterial behavior, excellent strength and stability under common processes. Due to its simplicity, the methodology presented in this work not only promises to result in a standard procedure to functionalize the&#160;mer&#160;units of Kevlar with&#160;&#160;a variety of chemicals and nanomaterials but it can be also extended for the modification and hybridization of other fabrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Re&#8208;thinking Dimer Design Principles with Indolonaphthyridine Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet fission is a phenomenon that could significantly improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Indolonaphthyridine thiophene (INDT) is a photostable singlet fission material that could potentially be utilised in singlet fission&#8208;based photovoltaic devices. Here, we investigate the intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy we find the highest rate of singlet fission in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. Quantum calculations show the para&#8208;phenyl linker encourages enhanced monomer electronic coupling. Increased rates of singlet fission were also observed in the higher polarity o&#8208;dichlorobenzene, relative to toluene, indicating that charge&#8208;transfer states have a role in mediating the process. We find the mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Dyes Bearing Phosphine and Phosphorylamide Moieties: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,8&#8208;naphthalimides (NIs) represent a class of organic dyes with interesting optical properties that has been extensively explored in the last decades in lighting devices, chemosensors, optical probes or medicinal chemistry. However, despite their remarkable potential, reports on organometallic dyes bearing NIs are scarce and virtually inexistent regarding palladium(II) complexes. Herein, we report the synthesis of NIs bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties and the characterization of their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions. It is shown that the introduction of phosphine moieties in the naphthalimide core results in a marked increase in non&#8208;radiative processes, leading to a significant reduction of the emission efficiency and lifetime of these dyes, compared to amine&#8208;bearing counterparts. The complexation to Pd(II) sequesters the electronic contribution of chelating moieties, with complexes assuming an optical behavior similar to that of unsubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The complexation significantly increases the acidity of chelating secondary amines, giving rise to an unexpected intramolecular reaction that results in the formation of a novel 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety. The new dye exhibits good emission quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and sensitivity to basic media, evidencing potential for application in optical imaging and sensing scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral 2&#8208;Nitroallylic Amines via Cooperative Cation&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral allylic amines are valuable building blocks for biologically important compounds and natural products. In this study, we present the use of cooperative cation&#8208;binding catalysis as an efficient method for synthesizing chiral allylic amines. By utilizing a chiral oligoEG and potassium fluoride as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst and base, respectively, a wide range of biologically relevant chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amines are obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt; 99% ee) through the organocatalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Henry&#8208;like reaction of &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes with &#945;&#8208;amidosulfones as imine precursors. Extensive experimental studies are presented to illustrate plausible mechanisms. Preliminary use of a chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amine as a Michael acceptor demonstrated its potential application for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Diversified Penta&#8208;spiro&#8208;heterocyclic and Fused&#8208;heterocyclic Frameworks with Potent Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks containing indazolone are structurally unique and represent a class of potentially dominant skeletons. In this work, we successfully fulfilled Rh(III)&#8208;catalyst mediated substrate&#8208; and pH&#8208; controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8208;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades. This method had mild reaction conditions, a broad scope of substrates, moderate to good yields, and valuable applications, which could realize for the first time the generation of the novel di&#8208;spiro&#8208;heterocyclic and multiple fused&#8208;heterocyclic products with unique structures. More importantly, novel spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;indazolo[1,2&#8208;a]indazole] scaffold constructed by this method exhibited potent antitumor activity against a variety of refractory solid tumors and hematological malignancies in vitro. Overall, our work provided new insights into the construction of complex and diverse multiple spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic systems and offered novel valuable lead compounds for the discovery of antitumor drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction: Pd/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Borocarbonylation of Aryldiazonium Salts with Aliphatic Terminal Alkynes to gem&#8208;Bis(boryl) Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>We report the development of Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed selective 2,1&#8208;borocarbonylation reactions of aliphatic terminal alkynes with aryldiazonium salts and B2Pin2 to prepare gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones in one&#8208;pot. A series of corresponding products are obtained with good to excellent yields under a carbon monoxide atmosphere (10 bar). In addition, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance can be observed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that ethyl acetate serves as a proton source in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with Organic Azides: Formation of Fluorescent Boron&#8208;Fused Hexazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with organic azides afforded three different compounds, diborylamines, diboryltriazenes, and B2&#8208;hexazenes having a bicyclic B2N6 ring system. The reaction with aryl azides gave diborylamines, while the reaction with 1 equiv. of alkyl azides furnished diboryltriazenes. In the case of the reaction with an excess amount of 1&#176; alkyl azide, a new heterocyclic B2&#8208;hexazenes were obtained. The formation of the B2N6 structure could be explained by one general reaction mechanism via the diboryltriazene intermediate according to the control experiments and DFT calculations. The B2&#8208;hexazenes exhibited a strong fluorescence with a remarkably high fluorescent quantum yield of up to 96%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;site Metal Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical catalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and achieving high&#8208;value conversion of CO2 under the carbon&#8208;neutral policy. In CO2RR, the dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual&#8208;site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO2RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO2RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual&#8208;site catalysts and even multi&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO2RR, well&#8208;designed high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO2 conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.</dc:description>

The scaffold was first converted into a meridional Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of a Au(I)Cl moiety at the carbene center. The Au(I) center and the N,N&#8208;chelating moiety were expected to function as metallophilic and 4e&#8208;&#963;&#8208;donative interaction sites, respectively, in the binding of the second metal center. In this manner, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized with different 3d&#8208;metal sources, such as cationic CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII salts. SC&#8208;XRD analysis showed that the mono&#8208;3d&#8208;metal di&#8208;gold(I) trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were constructed through gold(I)&#8208;metal interactions.

         <title>Cyclization, Decyclization, and Metallacyclization of Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Homopropargylic Alcohols on Ruthenium(II) and Osmium(II) Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[Ru/Os(dppm)2Cl2] and pyridine/quinoline&#8208;substituted homopropargylic alcohols provided strategies to prepare new metalated heterocyclic and metalacyclic complexes by utilizing temperature&#8208;controlled divergent pathways and an unexpected decyclization mechanism. Cyclization, decyclization, and metallacyclization of pyridine&#8208;substituted homopropargylic alcohols on ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) centers (C.&#8197;Y. Wong et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Systematic investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[M(dppm)2Cl2] (M=Ru/Os; dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and pyridine/quinoline substituted homopropargylic alcohols uncovered the diverse Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8208;induced alkyne activation pathways. The alkynes underwent cyclization on M via a &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8221; pathway at lower temperatures, resulting in alkenyl intermediates which might further metallacyclize to give metallapyrroloindolizines. Conversely, reactions at higher temperatures induced alkyne cyclization on M via a &#8220;vinylidene&#8221; pathway, affording cyclic oxacarbene complexes. Additionally, a rare decyclization mechanism was observed during the transformation of a metallacyclization&#8208;resistant alkenyl complex into a cyclic oxacarbene complex. DFT calculations were employed to validate the experimental findings. Overall, these results not only provide insights into controlling alkyne activation pathways, but also offer new strategies for preparing metalated heterocyclic and metallacyclic complexes.

         <title>The First Cu(I)&#8208;Peptoid Complex: Enabling Metal Ion Stability and Selectivity via Backbone Helicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;peptoid complex is presented here. This complex is based on a helical peptoid incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) ligands pre&#8208;organized on the same side of the helix. Interplay between the first and second coordination spheres is demonstrated, where the first coordination sphere is provided by the two Bipy ligands and the second by the helical structure, enabling the high stability of Cu(I).







Abstract
Stabilization of Cu(I) is ubiquitous within native copper proteins. Understanding how to stabilize Cu(I) within synthetic biomimetic systems is therefore desired towards biological applications. Peptoids are an important class of peptodomimetics, that can bind metal ions and stabilize them in their high oxidation state. Thus, to date, they were not used for Cu(I) binding. Here we show how the helical peptoid hexamer, having two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) groups that face the same side of the helix, forms the intramolecular air stable Cu(I) complex. Further study of the binding site by rigorous spectroscopic techniques suggests that Cu(I) is tetracoordinated, binding to only three N atoms from the Bipy ligands and to the N&#8208;terminus of the peptoid's backbone. A set of control peptoids and experiments indicates that the Cu(I) stability and selectivity are dictated by the intramolecular binding, forced by the helicity of the peptoid, which can be defined as the second coordination sphere of the metal center.

         <title>Structural Conversion of Supramolecular Assembly in Solution by Thermally Induced Intramolecular Electron Transfer of [Co2Fe2] Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly was controlled by the thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST) of a [Co2Fe2] complex. The complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution. The thermal ETCST of the complex in the presence of a dicarboxylic acid changed the structure from the reverse vesicle to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through the formation of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to a wide variety of functional self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly containing a [Co2Fe2] complex through a thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST). With an amphiphilic anion, the [Co2Fe2] complex formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed thermal ETCST. In contrast, thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen&#8208;bond donor caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through hydrogen bond formation.

         <title>Strong Chiroptical Effects in the Absorption and Emission of Macrocycles Based on the 2,5&#8208;Diaminoterephthalate Minimal Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;pot reaction produces chiral macrocycles consisting of repeatable units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate (n=2&#8211;4). The products fluoresce in solution and the solid state at wavelengths that are dependent on the size of the macrocyclic ring. ECD and CPL spectra reveal high chiroptical activity in the red range, despite their small chromophores.







Abstract
Chiral fluorescent macrocycles consisting of two to four units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate can be readily synthesized in a one&#8208;pot manner from inexpensive building blocks. Depending on the concentration, either a paracyclophane&#8208;like dimer with closely stacked benzene rings or a triangular trimer is the main product of the reaction. The macrocycles exhibit fluorescence in solution as well as in the solid state with maxima that are red&#8208;shifted with decreasing size of the macrocyclic ring and are observed at wavelengths from 590 (tetramer in solution) to 700&#8197;nm (dimer in the solid state). Chirality dictates the differential absorption and emission of circularly polarized light by these molecules. The ECD and CPL effects are particularly strong for the trimer, which is characterized by relatively large dissymmetry factors gabs=&#177;2.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at 531&#8197;nm and glum=&#177;2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 at 580&#8197;nm in n&#8208;hexane, being at the same time highly luminescent (&#934;fl=13.7&#8201;%). Despite the small chromophore, the circularly polarized brightness BCPL of 2.3&#8197;dm3&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is comparable to values reported for other classes of established CPL emitters in the visible region, such as expanded helicenes or larger &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>The &#8220;How&#8221; and &#8220;Where&#8221; behind the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide by Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D nanomaterial with unique chemistry due to the combination of sp2 hybridization and oxygen functional groups (OFGs) even in single layer. OFGs play a fundamental role in the chemical functionalization of GO to produce GO&#8208;based materials for diverse applications. However, traditional strategies that employ epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids suffer of low control and undesirable side reactions, including by&#8208;product formation and GO reduction. Thiol&#8208;ene "click" reaction offers a promising and versatile chemical approach for the alkene functionalization (&#8208;C=C&#8208;) of GO, providing orthogonality, stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and high yields while reducing by&#8208;products. This review examines the chemical functionalization of GO via thiol&#8208;ene "click" reactions, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms, including the role of radical or base catalysts in triggering the reaction. We discuss the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; the reaction takes place on GO, the strategies to avoid unwanted side reactions, such as GO reduction and by&#8208;product formation. We anticipate that multi&#8208;functionalization of GO via the alkene groups will enhance GO physicochemical properties while preserving its intrinsic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral and Cationic Molybdenum Imido Alkylidene Cyclic Alkyl Amino Carbene (CAAC) Complexes for Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first neutral and cationic Mo imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes of the general formulae [Mo(N&#8208;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)2(CAAC)] and [Mo(N&#8208;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)(CAAC)][B(ArF)4] (X = Br, Cl, OTf, OC6F5; CAAC = 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyltetrahydropyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) have been synthesized from molybdenum imido bishalide alkylidene DME precursors. Different combinations of the imido and &#8220;X&#8221; ligands have been employed to understand synthetic peculiarities. Selected complexes have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the pronounced &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;acceptor characteristics of CAACs, the corresponding neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene CAAC complexes do not require the presence of stabilizing donor ligands such as nitriles.
Calculations on the PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP level for PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;SVP optimized geometries revealed partial charges at molybdenum similar to the corresponding molybdenum imido alkylidene N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with a slightly higher polarization of the molybdenum alkylidene bond in the CAAC complexes. All cationic complexes have been tested in olefin metathesis reactions and showed improved activity compared to the analogous NHC complexes for hydrocarbon&#8208;based substrates, allowing for turnover numbers (TONs) up to 9500 even at room temperature. Some Mo imido alkylidene CAAC complexes are tolerant towards functional groups like thioethers and sulfonamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of buffered nano&#8208;submicron hierarchical structure hollow SiOx@C anodes for lithium&#8208;ion battery materials with carboxymethyl chitosan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;based materials are among the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the volume expansion and poor conductivity of silicon&#8208;based materials during the charge and discharge process seriously hinder their practical application in the field of anodes. Here, we choose carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) as the carbon source coating and binding on the surface of nano silicon and hollow silicon dioxide (H&#8208;SiO2) to form a hierarchical buffered structure of nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C. The hollow H&#8208;SiO2 can alleviate the volume expansion of nano silicon during the lithiation process under continuous cycling. Meanwhile, the carbon layer carbonized by CMCS containing N&#8208;doping further regulates the silicon&#8217;s expansion and improves the conductivity of the active materials. The as prepared SiOx@C material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 985.4 mAh g&#8208;1 with the decay rate of 0.27% per cycle in 150 cycles under the current density of 0.2 A g&#8208;1. It is proved that the hierarchical buffer structure nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C anode material has practical application potential.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Silicon-based materials are among the most promising anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, the volume expansion and poor conductivity of silicon-based materials during the charge and discharge process seriously hinder their practical application in the field of anodes. Here, we choose carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) as the carbon source coating and binding on the surface of nano silicon and hollow silicon dioxide (H-SiO2) to form a hierarchical buffered structure of nano-hollow SiOx@C. The hollow H-SiO2 can alleviate the volume expansion of nano silicon during the lithiation process under continuous cycling. Meanwhile, the carbon layer carbonized by CMCS containing N-doping further regulates the silicon&#8217;s expansion and improves the conductivity of the active materials. The as prepared SiOx@C material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 985.4 mAh g-1 with the decay rate of 0.27% per cycle in 150 cycles under the current density of 0.2 A g-1. It is proved that the hierarchical buffer structure nano-hollow SiOx@C anode material has practical application potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Bridged Fullerene Dumbbells and Their Interaction with the [10]Cycloparaphenylene Nanoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel sugar&#8208;bridged fullerene dumbbells were synthesized and fully characterized. Methano&#8208; and furan&#8208;fused C60 interacted with [10]CPP, an electron&#8208;donating nanoring, to form bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes. Interestingly, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules showed a different binding behaviour as mono&#8208;, bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell&#8208;shaped fullerene molecules connected by isosorbide and isomannide moieties is presented. Additionally, their electrochemical behavior and their ability to form complexes with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were investigated. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results of the fullerene dumbbells demonstrate a high electron affinity, indicating their strong interaction with electron&#8208;donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which possess complementary charge and shape properties. To study the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed. NMR titration experiments provided further insights into the binding stoichiometries. Two distinct approaches were utilized to create bridged structures: one based on cyclopropane and the other based on furan. Regardless of the type of linker used, all derivatives formed conventional 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes denoted as [10]CPP2&#8835;C60derivative. However, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules exhibited distinct binding behavior, resulting in the formation of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes, as well as oligomers (polymers). The formation of linear polymers holds significant potential for applications in solar energy conversion processes.

Due to their advantages of no need of real&#8208;time light excitation, avoiding autofluorescence, low imaging background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, deep tissue penetration and high sensitivity, afterglow imaging technology has been widely used in cell tracking, biosensing, cancer diagnosis and cancer therapy, which provides an effective technical method for the acquisition of molecular information with high sensitivity, specificity and real&#8208;time at the cellular and living level.

         <title>Construction of Five Tryptophan Isomers and Application of the Isomers to Solid&#8208;Phase Total Syntheses of Lysocin E Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five tryptophan (Trp) isomers were prepared in which the indole C3&#8208;substitution was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions and were then applied to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase total syntheses of the analogues of antibiotic lysocin E. The biological evaluation revealed the importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue.







Abstract
Tryptophan (Trp) plays a unique role in peptides and proteins as its indole ring possesses an electron&#8208;rich character and an N1&#8722;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor. Because of its non&#8208;rotationally symmetric structure, synthetic alterations of the orientation of the indole ring would modulate the intrinsic structures and functions of peptides and proteins. Here we developed synthetic routes to the five Trp isomers in which the C3&#8208;substitution of the indole ring was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions, and applied the five monomers to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Specifically, the five monomers were prepared via Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions of C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;iodoindoles. To demonstrate the applicability of the monomers to the solid&#8208;phase synthesis, the five Trp isomers of macrocyclic antibiotic lysocin E were selected as target molecules and synthesized through peptide elongation, on&#8208;resin macrocyclization, and global deprotection. The Trp isomers displayed markedly weaker antibacterial activity than the parent natural product, revealing the biological importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue of lysocin E. The present methods for the preparation and application of these five Trp isomers provide a new strategy for analyzing and modifying the specific functions of numerous Trp&#8208;containing peptides and proteins beyond this study.

         <title>Electrophilic Si&#8722;H Activation by Acetonitrilo Benzo[h]quinoline Iridacycles: Influence of Electronic Effects in Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The evaluation in hydrosilylation catalysis of six new benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8722;X (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;H, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;(NO2)2) at the heterochelating ligand shows direct substituent dependence consistent with the electrophilic activation of the hydrosilane by the precatalyst.







Abstract
The performance of six newly synthesized benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8722;X (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;H, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;(NO2)2) on the heterochelating ligand were evaluated in the dehydro&#8208;O&#8208;silylation of benzyl alcohol and the monohydrosilylation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzonitrile by Et3SiH, two reactions involving the electrophilic activation of the Si&#8722;H bond. The benchmark shows a direct dependence of the catalytic efficiency with the electronic effect of &#8722;X, which is confirmed by theoretical assessment of the intrinsic silylicities &#928; of hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts and by the theoretical evaluation of the propensity of hydridospecies to transfer the hydrido ligand to the activated substrate. The revisited analysis of the Ir&#8722;Si&#8722;H interactions shows that the most cohesive bond in hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts is the Ir&#8722;H one, while the Ir&#8722;Si is a weak donor&#8208;acceptor dative bond. The Si&#8230;H interaction in all the cases is noncovalent in nature and dominated by electrostatics confirming the heterolytic cleavage of the hydrosilane's Si&#8722;H bond in this key catalytically relevant species.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization for the Divergent Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed methodology leads to four kinds of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives starting from readily available podophyllotoxin in a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Some of them are found to show excellent anticancer activity. This direct C&#8722;H functionalization can be expressed the podophyllotoxin (roots of podophyllum species) being converted into derivatives (leaves) by rhodium catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Li, H. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300960).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been revealed here. Under established reaction conditions, C7&#8208;allylation of various modified indolines, including drug compounds, was accomplished with good selectivity and yields. Based on combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, the olefin insertion route was energetically favorable among four possible pathways. Experimental and DFT studies revealed that C&#8208;H activation is reversible and the rate&#8208;limiting step in the olefin insertion pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Hierarchical Porous MoO 2 @Mo 2 N@C Composite via a Confined Pyrolysis Synthetic Strategy towards Lithium&#8208;ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) demonstrates huge potential toward lithium ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. The sluggish reaction kinetics and large volume change during cycling process, however, unavoidably lead to inferior electrochemical performance, thus failing to satisfy the requirements of practical applications. Herein, we developed a molybdenum&#8208;based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy to achieve a novel hierarchical porous MoO2@Mo2N@C composite. A two&#8208;step successive annealing process was proposed to obtain a hybrid phase of MoO2&#160;and Mo2N, which was used to further improve the electrochemical performance of MoO2&#8208;based anode. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;dispersed MoO2&#160;nanoparticles can ensure ample active sites exposure to the electrolyte, while conductive Mo2N quantum dots afford pseudo&#8208;capacitive response, which conduces to the migration of ions and electrons. Additionally, the interior voids could provide buffer spaces to surmount the effect of volume change, thereby avoiding the fracture of MoO2&#160;nanoparticles. Benefiting from the aforesaid synergies, the as&#8208;obtained MoO2@Mo2N@C electrode demonstrates a striking initial discharge capacity (1760.0 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.1 A g&#8208;1) and decent long&#8208;term cycling stability (652.5 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 1.0 A g&#8208;1). This work provides a new way for the construction of advanced anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>The s&#8208;p Nonhybrid Nature Causes Adaptive Superatomic States of Bismuth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a joint experimental and theoretical study on the stability and reactivity of Bin+ (n = 5&#8211;33) clusters. The alternating odd&#8208;even effect on the reaction rates of Bin+ clusters with NO is observed, and Bi7+ finds the most inertness. First&#8208;principles calculation results reveal that the lowest energy structures of Bi6&#8210;9+ exhibit quasi&#8208;spherical geometry pertaining to the jellium shell model; however, but the Bin+ (n &#8805; 10) clusters adopt assembly structures. The prominent stability of Bi7+ is associated with its highly symmetric structure and superatomic states with a magic number of 34e closed shell. For the first time, we demonstrate that the unique s&#8208;p nonhybrid feature in bismuth rationalizes the stability of Bi6&#8211;9+ clusters within the jellium model, by filling the 6s electrons into the superatomic orbitals (forming &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221;). Interestingly, the stability of 18e &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221; coincides with the compact structure for Bin+ at n&#8804;9 but assembly structures for n &#8805;10, showing an accommodation of the s electrons to the geometric structure. The atomic p&#8208;orbitals also allow to form superatomic orbitals at higher energy levels, contributing to the preferable structures of tridentate binding units. We illustrate the s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature accommodates the structure and superatomic states of bismuth clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Crabtree&#8208;Pfaltz Hydrogenation of Olefins &#8211; An Interplay of Experimentation and Quantum Chemical Computation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract
Introduction of Crabtree's iridium&#8208;based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hy&#173;dro&#173;genation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&#8208; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to nume&#173;rous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic de&#173;tails posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed IrI/IrIII catalytic cycle by a novel IrIII/IrV cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to de&#173;scribe a fascinating interplay of experi&#173;ments and quantum chemical calculations for an important syn&#173;thet&#173;ic method.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Automated Glycan Assembly to Prepare Lipid&#8208;Peptide&#8208;Glycan Chimeras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomaterials with improved biological features can be obtained by conjugating glycans to nanostructured peptides. Creating peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras requires superb chemoselectivity. We expedite access to such chimeras by merging peptide and glycan solid&#8208;phase syntheses employing a bifunctional monosaccharide. The concept was explored in the context of the on&#8208;resin generation of a model &#945;(1&#8594;6)tetramannoside linked to peptides, lipids, steroids, and adamantane. Chimeras containing a &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside and self&#8208;assembling peptides such as FF, FFKLVFF, and the amphiphile palmitoyl&#8208;VVVAAAKKK were prepared in a fully automated manner. The robust synthetic protocol requires a single purification step to obtain overall yields of about 20%. The &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside FFKLVFF chimera produces micelles rather than nanofibers formed by the peptide alone as judged by microscopy and circular dichroism. The peptide amphiphile&#8208;glycan chimera forms a disperse fiber network, creating opportunities for new glycan&#8208;based nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR) is an eco&#8208;friendly way to convert CO2 and H2O into high&#8208;value chemical feedstocks and fuels using solar energy. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the strategies developed to drive the efficient overall PCRR over heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts. Essential future research directions have also been discussed.







Abstract
The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR), which uses solar energy to convert CO2 and H2O into chemical feedstocks or fuels without sacrificial reagents, plays a momentous role in CO2 utilization and solar energy conversion. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient conversion. Researchers have explored various strategies to realize the overall PCRR efficiently. In this Review, we first explain the criteria for evaluating the overall PCRR and then summarize the following strategies developed over the past decade to promote it: self&#8208;driving material development, Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction construction, cocatalyst loading, heteroatom doping, surface vacancy creation, and carrier&#8208;material matching.

     alt="Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (PCRR) is an eco-friendly way to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into high-value chemical feedstocks and fuels using solar energy. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the strategies developed to drive the efficient overall PCRR over heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts. Essential future research directions have also been discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (PCRR), which uses solar energy to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into chemical feedstocks or fuels without sacrificial reagents, plays a momentous role in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization and solar energy conversion. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient conversion. Researchers have explored various strategies to realize the overall PCRR efficiently. In this Review, we first explain the criteria for evaluating the overall PCRR and then summarize the following strategies developed over the past decade to promote it: self-driving material development, Z-scheme heterojunction construction, cocatalyst loading, heteroatom doping, surface vacancy creation, and carrier-material matching. Finally, we discuss essential future research directions in the field. Through this comprehensive Review, we aim to provide strategic guidance for the development of efficient overall PCRR systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Easily Accessible Substituted Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos as Bistable Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioaurone chromophores, also known as Hemithioindigos as they belong to the indigoid family, recently received a massive attraction because of their photoswitching properties. Here is presented a study on heterocyclic hemithioindigos (Het&#8208;HTIs) first from a synthetic part with the synthesis of very diversified structures involving electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles but also different modifications on the thioindigo moiety. Another part is devoted to determining the photoswitching performances of these synthesised compounds highlighting the influence of the nature of the heterocycles on the photoisomerization capabilities, more noticeable than the modifications afforded on the thioindigo part. Among a series of 44 Het&#8208;this, some were reported as very interesting photoswitchable compounds, presenting an efficient Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization in blue (82&#8208;85% E&#8208;isomer at 425 nm or 450 nm), an efficient E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization in red (95% Z&#8208;isomer at 650 nM), and half&#8208;lives for metastable E&#8208;isomer of up to 54 days in a polar solvent (DMSO). Our results proved that heterocyclic hemithioindigos exhibit auspicious features as efficient photoswitches to anyone interested in controlling molecular mechanisms by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Nitroxide Spin Labels for Structural and Conformational Studies of Biomolecules by Maleimide Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroxide (NO) spin radicals are effective in characterizing structures, interactions and dynamics of biomolecules. The EPR applications in cell lysates or intracellular milieu require stable spin labels, but NO radicals are unstable in such conditions. We showed that the destabilization of NO radicals in cell lysates or even in cells is caused by NADPH/NADH related enzymes, but not by the commonly believed reducing reagents such as GSH. Maleimide stabilizes the NO radicals in the cell lysates by consumption of the NADPH/NADH that are essential for the enzymes involved in destabilizing NO radicals, instead of serving as the thiol scavenger. The maleimide treatment retains the crowding properties of the intracellular components and allows to perform long&#8208;time EPR measurements of NO labeled biomolecules close to the intracellular conditions. The strategy of maleimide treatment on cell lysates for the EPR applications has been demonstrated on double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on a number of NO labeled protein samples. The method opens a broad application range for the NO labeled biomolecules by EPR in conditions that resemble the intracellular milieu.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldamer Nanotubes Mediated Label&#8208;Free Detection of Protein&#8208;Small Molecule Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label free detection of protein&#8208;small molecule interactions mediated by the helical peptide nanotubes using impedance spectroscopy is reported. This method can be used to detect interactions of protein and small molecules at very low concentrations.







Abstract
Development of miniaturized lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices for the detection of rapid and specific small molecule&#8208;protein binding interactions at very low concentrations holds significant importance in drug discovery and biomedical applications. Here, the label&#8208;free detection of small molecule&#8208;protein interactions is reported on the surface functionalizable nanotubes of &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide helical foldamers using nanoscale capacitance and impedance spectroscopy. The 12&#8208;helix conformation of the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide observed in the single crystals, self&#8208;assembled into nanotubes in an aqueous environment with exposed cysteine thiols for small molecule conjugation. The binding of streptavidin to the covalently linked biotin on the surface of nanotubes was detected at the picomolar concentrations. No change in the capacitance and impedance were observed in the absence of either immobilized biotin or protein streptavidin. The functionalizable hybrid peptide nanotubes reported here pave the way for the label&#8208;free detection of various small molecule protein interactions at very low concentrations.

         <title>Photoinduced Minisci Reaction with Diazines: An Approach Toward Original Fused Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced Minisci reaction on diazines, starting from carboxylic acid is reported using 4CzIPN (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the photoinitiator. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44&#8201;% to 89&#8201;%) under white LEDs irradiation with a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2&#8197;equiv.) and the extension to continuous flow was demonstrated. Further cyclization reactions were developed to build up unprecedented N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks. A plausible radical chain mechanism was suggested.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a photoinduced Minisci reaction on a large panel of diazines with good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44&#8201;% to 89&#8201;%). The reaction using 4CzIPN (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as photoinitiator was carried out under white LED irradiation and required a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2&#8197;equiv.). Cyclization reactions were then developed to access original N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks for drug discovery programs. An extension of the reaction to continuous flow was also reported. Finally, the mechanism of the transformation was studied suggesting a plausible radical chain mechanism.

The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis.

Abstract
The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. If a catalyst has multiple functions, such as inducing bond cleavage and formation, it can streamline multi&#8208;step transformations. Herein, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine is reported. Mechanistically, Cu catalyzes the conversion of diazetidine into the corresponding imine, which then reacts with aziridine to form imidazolidine. The scope is sufficiently wide to form various imidazolidines, as many functional groups are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <dc:description>
Polymer nanoantidotes act as shields to protect tissue from xenobiotics by neutralizing toxicity in situ with the mechanisms of physical interaction, chemical bonding, or biomimetic clearance. Their excellent efficacies predict a significant potential for clinical transformation. More information can be found in the Concept by H.

         <title>Stepwise Stimuli&#8208;Responsive, Multicolor&#8208;Chromic Perylene Bisimide/Polyvinyl Alcohol Co&#8208;assembly System for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides/polyvinyl alcohol for the application of multidimensional information encryption has been developed. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved through an evolution process including photoinduced electron transfer to PBI, packing rearrangement and oxidation of PBI radical anions/dianions.







Abstract
The issue of information security has become a concern in all aspects of daily life, prompting the development of encryption technologies. Therein, optical encryption using color/graphical patterns holds great potential. However, current approaches generally rely on monochromic change upon one or more stimuli, limiting their further application in advanced confidential encryption. Herein, we propose a delicate strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides (PBI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that demonstrates stepwise stimuli response and multicolor changes. The color of the supramolecular system changes from red to purple under the stimulus of UV light, and to orange when exposed to water. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved by an evolution process including the generation, packing rearrangement and quenching of PBI radical anions/dianions. With the virtues of photo&#8208; and hydrochromism, this novel co&#8208;assembly system was successfully employed for advanced anticounterfeiting and versatile information encryption applications.

         <title>Inversion of Diaza[5]Helicenes Through an N&#8722;N Bond Breaking Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages were found to racemize through the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;breaking pathway by kinetic experiments and DFT calculations. Modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix reduced the electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond, resulting in a significant increase in the inversion barrier.







Abstract
1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine and its S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide are diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages. Kinetic experiments on racemization together with DFT calculations revealed that they undergo inversion through the N&#8722;N bond breaking pathway rather than the general conformational pathway. In these diaza[5]helicenes with this inversion mechanism, the reduction of electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond by modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix led to a significantly higher inversion barrier, 35.3&#8197;kcal/mol, compared to [5]helicene. 1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide was highly resistant to acid&#8208;mediated N&#8722;N bond breaking and racemization under acidic conditions.

         <title>Stable Spiro&#8208;Fused Diarylaminyl Radicals: A New Type of a Neutral Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of stable spiro&#8208;fused diarylaminyl radicals that are radical cations with the &#8220;canceled charge&#8221; was obtained. The radicals belong to Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day neutral mixed&#8208;valence systems that are rare. They are valuable models to mimic natural electron transfer reactions promoting a deeper understanding of their mechanism. The advanced properties of the radicals make them of potential interest in materials science.







Abstract
A new type of neutral mixed&#8208;valence system was synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot procedure. The spiro&#8208;conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in&#8208;depth experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence systems. The structure of the radicals was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray data, which are relatively rare for Class&#8197;II MV molecules. Advanced properties of the radicals, such as an ambipolar redox behavior and panchromatic absorption in the visible and NIR regions, along with their stability, make them of interest for materials science. All radicals demonstrate the SOMO&#8208;HOMO inversion phenomenon, which was supported by the DFT and the experimental study.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separated States in Anthraquinone&#8208;Phenothiazine Dyads: Synthesis and Study of the Photophysical Property by Using Transient Optical and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived charge separated state was observed in phenothiazine&#8208;anthraquinone dyads containing adamantane linker. The photophysical processes were studied with steady state and femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic method. The electron exchange of the radical ion pairs was quantified with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra.







Abstract
In order to obtain long&#8208;lived charge separated (CS) states in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, herein we prepared a series of anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) dyads, with adamantane as the linker. UV&#8211;vis absorption spectra show negligible electronic interaction between the AQ and PTZ units at ground state, yet charge transfer (CT) emission bands were observed. Nanosecond transient absorption shows that the 3AQ state is populated upon photoexcitation for AQ&#8208;PTZ in cyclohexane (CHX), but in acetonitrile (ACN) a 3CS state is formed. Similar results were observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M. The 3CS state lifetimes were determined as 0.52&#8197;&#956;s and 0.49&#8197;&#956;s, respectively. Upon oxidation of the PTZ unit, the 3AQ state was observed in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. For AQ&#8208;PTZ, femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast formation of the 3AQ state in all solvents, with no charge separation in CHX, while formation of the 3CS state takes 106&#8197;ps in ACN. For AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, a 3CS state is formed in CHX within 241&#8197;ps. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show that a radical ion pair with electron exchange energy of |2&#8197;J|&#8805;5.68&#8197;mT was observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ and AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, whereas in the dyads with the PTZ unit oxidized, only the 3AQ state was observed.

Nanosecond transient absorption shows that the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;AQ state is populated upon photoexcitation for &lt;b&gt;AQ-PTZ&lt;/b&gt; in cyclohexane (CHX), but in acetonitrile (ACN) a &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CS state is formed. Similar results were observed for &lt;b&gt;AQ-PTZ-M&lt;/b&gt;. The &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CS state lifetimes were determined as 0.52&#8197;&#956;s and 0.49&#8197;&#956;s, respectively. Upon oxidation of the PTZ unit, the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;AQ state was observed in both polar and non-polar solvents. For &lt;b&gt;AQ-PTZ&lt;/b&gt;, femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast formation of the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;AQ state in all solvents, with no charge separation in CHX, while formation of the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CS state takes 106&#8197;ps in ACN. For &lt;b&gt;AQ-PTZ-M&lt;/b&gt;, a &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CS state is formed in CHX within 241&#8197;ps. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show that a radical ion pair with electron exchange energy of |2&#8197;&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;|&#8805;5.68&#8197;mT was observed for &lt;b&gt;AQ-PTZ&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;AQ-PTZ-M&lt;/b&gt;, whereas in the dyads with the PTZ unit oxidized, only the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;AQ state was observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads for Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ambipolar molecular donor&#8208;acceptor dyads D5&#8208;D10 was synthesized and characterized allowing for the elaboration of valuable structure&#8208;property relationships, which were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.







Abstract
A series of ambipolar covalently linked oligothiophene&#8208;fullerene dyads have been synthesized by systematical structural variations. In this respect, the length of linker between donor and acceptor unit was altered and in a second series the terminal acceptor units in the donor unit of the dyads were varied. Characterization of the optical and redox properties gave valuable structure&#8208;property relationships and were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Drug Release from Nanometric Micelles in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micelles constructed with sydnonimines are cleaved upon addition of cyclooctynes in a bioorthogonal manner, leading to the massive release of an anticancer drug in living cells. Fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion from the micelles core.







Abstract
We explored a bioorthogonal approach to release drugs from stimuli&#8208;responsive micelles inside tumor cells. The concept relies on sydnonimine&#8208;based micelles that undergo quantitative cleavage in presence of cyclooctynes, hence releasing their content within living cells. Four cleavable micelles were developed to allow massive burst release of Entinostat, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, following their internalization inside cancer cells. A comparative study on the influence of the bioorthogonal&#8208;mediated versus passive drug release from micelles was carried out. The results indicated that a fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion of the drug from the micelles core. These finding may be of great interest for the development of new nanomedicines.

Chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is described using a cost&#8208;effective pincer&#8208;ligated manganese catalyst at room temperature.







Abstract
Chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of C=C bond in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is demonstrated at room temperature employing a manganese(I) catalyst and half an equivalent of ammonia&#8208;borane (H3N&#8722;BH3). A series of mixed&#8208;donor pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(II) complexes, (tBu2PN3NPyz)MnX2 [&#954;P,&#954;N,&#954;N&#8208;(N&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine)MnX2] {X=Cl (Mn2), X=Br (Mn3), X=I (Mn4)} were synthesized and characterized. Amongst the Mn(II) complexes, (Mn2, Mn3, Mn4) and Mn(I) complex, (tBu2PN3NPyz)Mn(CO)2Br (Mn1) screened; the Mn1 acts as an efficient catalyst for the chemoselective C=C bond reduction in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Various synthetically important functionalities like halides, methoxy, trifluoromethyl, benzyloxy, nitro, amine, and unconjugated alkene and alkyne groups, including heteroarenes, were compatible and provided saturated ketones in excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;%). A preliminary mechanistic study highlighted the crucial role of metal&#8211;ligand (M&#8211;L) cooperation through the dearomatization&#8208;aromatization process in catalyst Mn1 for the chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation.

         <title>Mechanism of Acyl Group Migration in Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyl groups are prone to migrate in carbohydrates, causing issues in the laboratory setting. Migration could also have biological relevance, such as in regulation of cell signaling. Recently, deeper investigations have been performed on the mechanism of this phenomenon. In this concept article some of the investigations are discussed, providing insights into the mechanism and the migration process in general.







Abstract
Acyl group migration has been the subject of several studies. Such migration processes may cause problems during synthesis, isolation, and purification of different acyl&#8208;bearing compounds, and have biological relevance, for example, in the metabolism of pharmaceuticals. Considering the recent evidence of acyl group migration being possible even over glycosidic bonds, it could be hypothesized to be involved also in the regulation of biological activity of natural polysaccharides in the host cells. Migrations are mostly observed in carbohydrates, typically having several hydroxyl groups near each other. Several studies have investigated the migration in a single or only a few different carbohydrate molecules, providing different suggestions for the mechanisms of migration, seldom supported by comprehensive computational investigations. In this concept article we discuss the recent progress on the mechanistic aspects of acyl group migration, with carbohydrates in particular focus.

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fullerene&#8208;derived molecular torsion balances have been synthesized to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the dispersion force to the arene&#8212;fullerene interaction. The torsion balance with a mercaptophenyl group was converted to the corresponding thiophenolate anion by adding an amine. Consequently, the anionic arene&#8212;fullerene interactions were elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yamada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300877).

         <title>3&#8208;Ligated Phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile Dyads and Triads &#8208; Synthesis, Electronic Properties, Delayed Fluorescence and Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prompt and delayed emission: A series of 3&#8208;ligated or bridged phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile dyads and triads are accessed in a one&#8208;pot fashion and photophysical studies in solution, solid&#8208;state and in polymer matrix reveal TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) as estimated experimentally for four dyes and confirmed by DFT/MRCI calculations for one dyad.







Abstract
The bromine&#8208;lithium exchange&#8208;borylation&#8208;Suzuki sequence efficiently furnishes phenothiazine&#8208;terephthalonitrile donor&#8208;acceptor dyads and triads in high yields. In contrast to most phenothiazine&#8208;acceptor conjugates the title compounds are ligated in p&#8208;position to the phenothiazine nitrogen atom. Moreover, the acceptors are either directly linked or ligated by an arylene bridge and p&#8208;anisyl N&#8208;substituents on the phenothiazine are chosen to lock the tricycle into an intra&#8208;configuration. Cyclic voltammetry reveals effects of bridging and ligation of the N&#8208;substituent. Optical spectroscopy likewise displays similar band gaps, large Stokes shifts and substantial to high quantum yields in solution, in the solid state and in PMMA matrix. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy indicates quite long fluorescence decay times in solution and emission components in the microsecond time range. TADF properties are further assessed by fluorescence increase in deoxygenated solution, gated emission spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent determination of phosphorescence. The nature of the electronically excited states is investigated by DFT/MRCI. While for the directly ligated dyad a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap &#916;
of 0.24&#8197;eV can be estimated and is consistently confirmed by quantum chemical calculations on the lowest energy conformer, even lower 
of 0.029 and 0.008&#8197;eV are estimated for the investigated dyads and the triad in the solid state and in PMMA matrix.

         <title>Borylated Subphthalocyanines: Versatile Precursors for the Preparation of Functional Bowl&#8208;Shaped Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. Herein we report the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated Subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8208;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Intramolecular [2 + 2] Trapping of 1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes: a&#160;Route to Rigid, Angularly Fused Tricyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride&#8208;mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2 + 2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the cis&#8208;fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron&#8208;deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclohexenones. Multiple synthetic routes have been developed to install the appropriate functional groups required for [2 + 2] trapping.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Urea Type Linker For Functionalisation of Natural Glycans and its Validation in Glycan Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The isolation from organisms and readily available glycoproteins has become an increasingly convenient source of N&#8208;glycans for multiple applications including glycan microarrays, as reference standards in glycan analysis or as reagents that improve bioavailability of protein and peptide therapeutics through conjugation. A problematic step in the isolation process on a preparative scale can be the attachment of a linker for the improved purification, separation, immobilization and quantification of the glycan structures. Addressing this issue, we firstly aimed for the development of an UV active linker for a fast and reliable attachment to anomeric glycosylamines via urea bond formation. Secondly, we validated the new linker on glycan arrays in a comparative study with a collection of N&#8208;glycans which were screened against various lectins. In total, we coupled four structurally varied N&#8208;glycans to four different linkers, immobilized all constructs on a microarray and compared their binding affinities to four plant and fungal lectins of widely described specificity. Our study shows that the urea type linker showed an overall superior performance for lectin binding and once more, highlights the often neglected influence of the choice of linker on lectin recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Crystalline Intermediates in Mechanochemical Cyclorhodation Reactions Elucidated by in situ X&#8208;ray Powder Diffraction and Computations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The occurrence of crystalline intermediates in mechanochemical reactions may be more widespread than previously assumed. For example, a recent study involving the acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation of N&#8208;heterocycles with [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling revealed the formation of transient cocrystals between the reagents prior to the C&#8211;H activation step. However, such crystalline intermediates were only observed through stepwise intervallic ex situ analysis and their exact role in the C&#8211;H activation process remained unclear. In the present study, we monitored the formation of discrete, stoichiometric cocrystals between benzo[h]quinoline and [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This continuous analysis revealed an initial cocrystal that transformed into a second crystalline form. Computational studies showed that differences in non&#8208;covalent interactions made the [Cp*RhCl2]2 unit in the later&#8208;appearing cocrystal more reactive towards reaction with NaOAc. This demonstrated the advantage of cocrystal formation before the acetate&#8208;assisted metalation&#8208;deprotonation step and evidence how the net cooperative action of weak interactions between the reagents in mechanochemical experiments can lead to stable supramolecular assemblies, which can enhance substrate activation under ball milling conditions. This could explain the superiority of some mechanochemical reactions, such as acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation, compared to their solution&#8208;based counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>NAD(P)H:Quinone Acceptor Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) Activatable Salicylamide H+/Cl&#8210; Transporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxifying enzyme overexpressed in tumors, plays a key role in protecting cancer cells against oxidative stress and thus has been considered an attractive candidate for activating prodrug(s). Herein, we report the first use of NQO1 for the selective activation of &#8216;protransporter&#8217; systems in cancer cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. Salicylamides, easily synthesizable small molecules, have been effectively used for efficient H+/Cl&#8210; symport across lipid membranes. The ion transport activity of salicylamides was efficiently abated by caging the OH group with NQO1 activatable quinones via either ether or ester linkage. The release of active transporters, following the reduction of quinone caged &#8216;protransporters&#8217; by NQO1, was verified. Both the transporters and protransporters exhibited significant toxicity towards the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer line, mediated via the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lysosomal deacidification. Induction of cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway was verified by monitoring PARP1 cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigations on Bismuth Catalyzed Reduction of Ketones and Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.







Abstract
Lewis acidic bismuth compounds have found catalytic applications in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In this work, we present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4]2 in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.

         <title>Isolation, Structural and Physical Characterization as well as Reactivity of Persistent Acenium Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable salts of unsubstituted radical cations of anthracene, tetracene and pentacene were isolated in the condensed phase by deelectronation of the respective neutral acenes. The radical cation salts were structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized (IR, Raman, UV&#8208;Vis, EPR).







Abstract
The unsubstituted acenium radical cations (ARCs) are extremely sensitive and were hitherto only studied in&#8197;situ, i.&#8201;e. in the gas phase, as dilute solutions in strong acids or by matrix isolation spectroscopy at about 10&#8197;K. In this study, room temperature stable ARC salts with the weakly coordinating anion [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=&#8722;OC(CF3)3) supported by the weakly coordinating solvent 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) were prepared and structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized. Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led, non&#8208;innocent,[54] to intermediate [Ag2(acene)2]2+ complexes, which decompose over time to Ag0 and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed innocent[54] deelectronator radical cation salt [anthraceneHal]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led to phase&#8208;pure products [acene]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (anthraceneHal=9,10&#8208;dichlorooctafluoroanthracene; acene=anthra&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclovoltammetric measurements of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas&#8208;phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas&#8208;phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow&#8208;up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with 
 Co2(CO)8 giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)2]+.

         <title>Molecular and Crystal Structure, Spectroscopy, and Photochemistry of a Dispiro Compound Bearing the Tetraoxane Pharmacophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular structure and photochemistry of&#160;dispiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,3'&#8208;[1,2,4,5]tetraoxane&#8208;6',2''&#8208;tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]&#8208;4&#8208;one&#160;(TX), an antiparasitic 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxane, was investigated using matrix isolation IR and EPR spectroscopies, and quantum chemical calculations at the DFT(B3LYP)/6&#8208;311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory. Photolysis of the matrix&#8208;isolated&#160;TX, induced by&#160;in situ&#160;broadband (l&#160;&gt; 235 nm) or narrowband (l&#160;in the range 220&#8208;263 nm) irradiation, led to two photoproducts, oxepane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione and 4&#8208;oxohomoadamantan&#8208;5&#8208;one.&#160;&#160;Our studies show that these photoproducts result from initial photoinduced cleavage of an O&#8211;O bond, with formation of an oxygen&#8208;centered diradical that regioselectivity rearranges to a more stable (secondary carbon&#8208;centered)/(oxygen&#8208;centered) diradical, then yielding the final products. Formation of the diradical species was confirmed by EPR measurements, upon photolysis of&#160;TX&#160;at&#160;&#955;&#160;= 266 nm, in acetonitrile ice (T&#160;= 10&#8208;80 K). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrated that&#160;TXadopts nearly the same conformation in the crystal and under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions, revealing that intermolecular interactions in the&#160;TX&#160;crystal are weak. This result is in keeping with observed similarities between the infrared spectra of crystalline and matrix&#8208;isolated&#160;TX. The structural, vibrational, and photochemical data reported here is relevant to the practical uses of&#160;TX (and tetraoxane analogues)&#160;in medicinal chemistry, considering its efficient and broad parasiticidal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycrystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes for Separation of Light Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. In addition, the perspective of this topic has also been proposed.







Abstract
Due to facile designability and versatile nanospace, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as promising membrane materials. Compared to the mixed matrix membranes that incorporated with MOF particles, the polycrystalline MOF membranes demonstrates significant advantages in maximum utilizing the crystalline nanospace, and thus yielding a fruitful of achievements in the last twenty years. Although some reviews have summarized the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes, the theoretical framework for oriented design and preparation of polycrystalline MOF membranes for highly efficient separation of light hydrocarbons remains in infancy. Herein, in this review, the fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in the separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. Particularly, the MOF membranes with global and local dynamics have been proposed as an interesting topic promoted performance.

         <title>Nonorthogonal Cascade Catalysis in Multicompartment Micelles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;base bifunctional multicompartment micelle prepared from amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers is reported for the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Multicompartment micelles are promising nanostructures for compartmentalization of nonorthogonal catalysts for multistep transformations.







Abstract
Multicompartment micelles (MCMs) containing acid and base sites in discrete domains are prepared from poly(norbornene)&#8208;based amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers in aqueous media. The acid and base sites are localized in different compartments of the micelle, enabling the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization &#8211; Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Computational simulations using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) elucidated the bottlebrush composition required to effectively site&#8208;isolate the nonorthogonal catalysts. This contribution presents MCMs as a new class of nanostructures for one&#8208;pot multistep nonorthogonal cascade catalysis, laying the groundwork for the isolation of three or more incompatible catalysts to synthesize value&#8208;added compounds in a single reaction vessel, in water.

         <title>Merger of Rotation Restriction and Symmetrical Push&#8208;Pull to Synthesize Single&#8208;Benzene Yellow Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs in combination with restricting bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions is the key to creating small yet brightly emitting fluorophores. The tetrahydrobenzodifuran moiety is an effective core architecture to realize unique and powerful single&#8208;benzene fluorophores with high quantum yields and large Stokes shifts in a wide range of solvents.







Abstract
Small yet brightly emitting fluorophores should find fundamental and practical applications in both academic and industrial settings. In this report, tetrahydrobenzodifuran is used as the core architecture to create novel single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. The key for realizing unique and powerful photophysical properties is the combination of the construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs and the restriction of bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria through Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the combined effects of structure&#8208;induced accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity, cancerous mitochondria were selectively targeted by using cyanine&#8208;aryl acetylene conjugates. Covalent fixation of the conjugates, which is promoted by elevated pH and ROS levels in cancerous mitochondria, occurs through radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling, although no radical&#8208;based mechanism had previously been observed in live cells.







Abstract
Despite their long history and their synthetic potential underlined by various recent advances, radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling reactions have so far only rarely been exploited for the functionalization of biomolecules, and no examples yet exist for their application in live cells &#8208; although natural thiols show widespread occurrence therein. By taking advantage of the particular cellular conditions of mitochondria in cancer cells, we have demonstrated that radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling represents a powerful reaction principle for the selective targeting of these organelles. Within our studies, fluorescently labeled reactive alkyne probes were investigated, for which the fluorescent moiety was chosen to enable both mitochondria accumulation as well as highly sensitive detection. After preliminary studies under cell&#8208;free conditions, the most promising alkyne&#8208;dye conjugates were evaluated in various cellular experiments comprising analysis by flow cytometry and microscopy. All in all, these results pave the way for improved future therapeutic strategies relying on live&#8208;cell compatibility and selectivity among cellular compartments.

         <title>Design of Cu&#8208;Substituted O3&#8208;Type NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of different copper contents on the electrochemical performance of environmentally friendly CO/Ni&#8208;free O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based cathode is systematically investigated. The introduction of a high proportion of copper can simultaneously regulate both the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and the bulk phase. Therefore, the obtained cathode material with an optimized component of NaCu0.20Fe0.30Mn0.50O2 achieves a significant improvement in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3&#8208;NaFe0.50Mn0.50O2 materials is systematically investigated. The as&#8208;prepared NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase. It shows superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, a capacity retention rate of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;type layered cathode materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The effect of different copper contents&lt;/b&gt; on the electrochemical performance of environmentally friendly CO/Ni-free O3-type Fe/Mn-based cathode is systematically investigated. The introduction of a high proportion of copper can simultaneously regulate both the electrode-electrolyte interface and the bulk phase. Therefore, the obtained cathode material with an optimized component of NaCu&lt;sub&gt;0.20&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.30&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; achieves a significant improvement in electrochemical performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O3-type Fe/Mn-based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium-ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3-type Fe/Mn-based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3-NaFe&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials is systematically investigated. The as-prepared NaFe&lt;sub&gt;0.30&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase. It shows superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C, a capacity retention rate of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe&lt;sub&gt;0.30&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low-cost and high-performance O3-type layered cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pushing the Boundary of Covalency in Lanthanoid&#8208;Tellurium Bonds: Insights from the Synthesis, Molecular and Electronic Structures of Low&#8208;Coordinate, Monomeric Europium(II) and Ytterbium(II) Tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolate complexes is achieved using hybrid tellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. According to DFT calculations, while the complexes have most of their lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds located on the Te atoms, the lanthanoid metals contribute significantly to the bond, thus resulting in a notable covalency.







Abstract
Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing hybrid organotellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8&#8242;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metals (Ln=Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R=C6H4&#8208;2&#8208;CH2NMe2] [3: Ln=Eu, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln=Eu, Solv=acetonitrile; 5: Ln=Yb, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln=Yb, Solv=pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv=tetrahydrofuran, n=3; 8: Solv=1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n=2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8211;4 and 7&#8211;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3&#8211;8 are validated by single&#8211;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The electronic structures of these complexes were investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed appreciable covalency between the tellurolate ligands and lanthanoids.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Metallocene for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loading of homogeneous catalysts with support can dramatically improve their performance in olefin polymerization. However, the challenge lies in the development of supported catalysts with well&#8208;defined pore structures and good compatibility to achieve high catalytic activity and product performance. Herein, we report the use of an emergent class of porous material &#8208;&#8208; covalent organic framework material (COF) as a carrier to support metallocene catalyst &#8208;&#8208; Cp2ZrCl2 for ethylene polymerization. The COF&#8208;supported catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity of 31.1 &#215; 106 g/(mol&#183;h) at 140 &#176;C, compared with 11.2 &#215; 106 g/(mol&#183;h) of the homogenous one. The resulting polyethylene (PE) products possess higher weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) and narrower molecular weight distribution (&#393;) after COF supporting, i.e., Mw increases from 160 kDa to 308 kDa and &#393; reduces from 3.3 to 2.2. The melting point (Tm) is also increased by up to 5.2 &#176;C. Moreover, the PE product possesses a characteristic filamentous microstructure and demonstrates an increased tensile strength from 19.0 MPa to 30.7 MPa and elongation at break from 350% to 1400% after catalyst loading. We believe that the use of COF carriers will facilitate the future development of supported catalysts for high&#8208;efficient olefin polymerization and high&#8208;performance polyolefins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a rapidly growing discipline with many analytical applications from immunoassays to single molecule detection. At the forefront of ECL research is materials chemistry which looks at engineering new materials and compounds exhibiting enhanced ECL efficiencies compared to conventional fluorescent materials. In this minireview, we summarize recent molecular design strategies that lead to high efficiency ECL. In particular, we feature recent advances in the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to produce enhanced electrochemiluminescence. We also document how hydrogen&#8208;bonding, aggregation, and crystallization can each be recruited in the design of materials showing enhanced electrochemiluminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chirality Transfer to the Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide Anion of an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality transfer from the chiral molecule (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the achiral anion of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid is observed. The chiral probe selectively affects only one part of the binary ionic liquid, i.e., it has been shown before experimentally and theoretically that the particular imidazolium cation can be affected by chirality transfer, but in the present system chirality is only transferred to the anion and not to both parts of the solvent (anion and cation). This observation is of high relevance because of its selectivity and because anion effects are usually much more important in ionic liquid research than cation effects. From ab initio&#160;molecular dynamics simulations, a conformational analysis and dissected vibrational circular dichroism spectra are obtained to study the chirality transfer. While in the neat ionic liquid two mirror imaged trans&#160;conformers of the anion occur almost equally, we observe an excess of one of these conformers in the presence of the chiral solute, causing optical activity of the anion. Although, the cis&#160;conformers are not tremendously affected by the chirality transfer, they gain in total population when (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide is dissolved in the ionic liquid.</dc:description>

         <title>A 2,2&#8208;Difluoroimidazolidine Derivative for Deoxyfluorination Reactions: Mechanistic Insights by Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A N&#8208;heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;2&#8208;chloroimidazolidinium&#160;chloride&#160;(3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer&#8208;sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in situ fluorination the generated carboxylic acid was developed.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A N-heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N-1,3-dimesityl-2-chloroimidazolidinium&#160;chloride&#160;(3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer-sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in situ fluorination the generated carboxylic acid was developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
