         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Vicinal Intermolecular Annulations of Iodoarenes, Indoles, and Carbazoles with Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodobenzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with 1,6&#8208;enynes is described. The relay involved 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which were readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which a challenging benzylic monooxygenation was showcased.







Abstract
Reaching the formidable C&#8722;H corners has been one of the top priorities of organic chemists in the recent past. This prompted us to disclose herein a vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodo benzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with N&#8208;embedded 1,6&#8208;enynes through 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles. The relay does not require the assistance of any directing group, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which are readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which we showcase a rare benzylic mono&#8208;oxygenation.

         <title>Revealing the Unique Role of Water in the Formation of Benzothiazoles: an Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of benzothiazoles catalyzed by water is studied using both experimental and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods. Free energy calculations from DFT&#8208;metadynamics suggest water as the sole catalyst at room temperature. The influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on the chemical reactivity is discussed.







Abstract
We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthuss mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80&#8197;kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250&#8197;kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Pyranthiones/Pyrones: &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Donors for Subcellular Hydrogen Sulfide Delivery and Labeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN), features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs) for tunable H2S delivery and imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the most important gasotransmitters, plays a critical role in endogenous signaling pathways of many diseases. However, developing H2S donors with both tunable release kinetics and high release efficiency for subcellular delivery has been challenging. Here, we describe a click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN). This reaction features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs). Interestingly, pyranthiones showed enhanced reaction rates compared to their pyrone counterparts. We investigated pyrone biorthogonality and demonstrated their utility in protein labeling applications. Moreover, we synthesized substituted pyranthiones with H2S release kinetics that can address the range of physiologically relevant H2S dynamics in cells and achieved quantitative H2S release efficiency in&#8197;vitro. Finally, we explored the potential of pyranthiones as H2S/COS donors for mitochondrial&#8208;targeted H2S delivery in living cells.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8208;C to C&#8208;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#183;&#183;&#183;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this concept, we showcase the upsurge in the studies of dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials containing inorganic and/or organic components as versatile photo&#8208;responsive platforms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of photo&#8208;controllable RTP, and meanwhile delve into the underlying RTP properties of various classes of photochromic materials including metal&#8211;organic complexes, organic&#8208;inorganic co&#8208;crystals, purely organic small molecules and organic polymers. In particular, the design principles governing the integration of the photochromic and RTP moieties within a single material system, and the tuning of dynamic RTP in response to light are emphasized. As such, this concept sheds light on the challenges and opportunities of using these tunable RTP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics, particularly highlighting their use of reversible information encryption, erasable light printing and rewritable smart paper.</dc:description>

The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution.

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;O, C&#8208;S, and C&#8208;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiolabelled&#160;177Lu&#8208;Bispidine&#8208;Trastuzumab for Targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Cancers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radioimmunotherapy (TRIT) is a promising alternative to conventional treatment options. Here,&#160;we present experimental work on the synthesis, radiochemistry, and&#160;in vivo&#160;performance of a lanthanide&#8208;selective nonadentate bispidine ligand suitable for&#160;177Lu3+&#160;ion complexation. The ligand (bisp,1) was derivatised with a photoactivatable aryl azide (ArN3) group as a bioconjugation handle for light&#8208;induced labelling of proteins. Quantitative radiosynthesis of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;was accomplished in 10 minutes at 40oC. Subsequent incubation [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;with trastuzumab, followed by irradiation with light at 365 nm for 15 min, at room temperature and pH8.0&#8211;8.3, gave the radiolabelled mAb, [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;azepin&#8208;trastuzumab ([177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb) in a decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of 14%, and radiochemical purity (RCP)&gt;90%. Stability studies and cellular binding assays&#160;in vitro&#160;using the SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 human ovarian cancer cells confirmed that [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb remained biological active and displayed specific binding to HER2/neu. Experiments in immunocompromised female athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft models of SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 tumours revealed significantly higher tumour uptake in the normal group compared with the control block group (29.8&#177;11.4%ID g&#8208;1&#160;vs. 14.8&#177;6.1%ID g&#8208;1, respectively;&#160;P&#8208;value=0.037). The data indicate that bispidine&#8208;based ligand systems are suitable starting points for constructing novel, high&#8208;denticity chelators for specific complexation of larger radiotheranostic metal ion nuclides.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Novel Redox&#8208;Active Organic Materials Based on Benzimidazole, Benzoxazole, and Benzothiazole: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining theory and experiment allows the screening of new active materials. Electrochemical properties of the redox moieties can be predicted accurately. Out of three classes of molecule (benzo&#8208;thiazole, &#8208;oxazole, &#8208;imidazole), benzoxazoles exhibit the best electrochemical properties and can be further introduced into or onto a polymeric backbone, with the aim of being used in organic polymer batteries.







Abstract
Sustainability is one of the hot topics of today's research, in particular when it comes to energy&#8208;storage systems such as batteries. Redox&#8208;active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which partially rely on non&#8208;sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, &#8208;oxazole and &#8208;imidazole derivatives as redox&#8208;active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target molecules were identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical characterization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and used in organic polymer batteries.

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work azotriptycenes are presented as light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. Their mechanism of motion and changed kinetics upon isomerization are studied by theory and variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8722;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.

         <title>Remarkable Off&#8211;On Tunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by the Regulation of Pyrene Dimer</title>

Reversible &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent material: The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive due to the ordered and long&#8208;range &#960; stacking. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed owing to the formation of pyrene dimer structure. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material.







Abstract
It is always a challenge to achieve &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent switch by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions. Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non&#8208;emissive crystal consists of ordered H&#8208;aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti&#8208;parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material. The present results promote an in&#8208;depth insight between packing structure and photophysical property, and offer an effective strategy for the construction of luminescence &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching materials, toward the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Are &#8220;Carbon Dots&#8221; Always Carbon Dots? Evidence for their Supramolecular Nature from Structural and Dynamic Studies in Solution and in the Pure Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model unraveling the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, in which small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species present in dilute solution dynamically assemble into supramolecular organized structures when highly concentrated or in the solid state. (HR&#8208;TEM: high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, PFG&#8208;NMR: pulsed field gradient&#8208;NMR, TRFA: time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy).







Abstract
A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in the solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is proposed herein. Overwhelming evidence has been collected that links the data coming from solid&#8208;state analysis (high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG)&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species when the solvent is removed to give the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. This study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).

         <title>Access to NHC&#8211;Boryl Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Selenide and Utility as Mild Selenium Transfer Reagent including to the C&#8722;F Bond</title>

Access to NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;boryl mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenides from NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 has been achieved. The boryl mono selenide has been demonstrated to function as a selenium transfer reagent, enabling the synthesis of selenoethers from benzyl bromide. Additionally, it can also facilitate the conversion of the challenging aromatic C&#8722;F bond to a C&#8722;Se bond, resulting in concomitant ring expansion of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;haloborane.







Abstract
Reactions of 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 (5&#8208;SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) (1) with diphenyldiselenide provide access to 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8211;boryl mono&#8208; (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2SePh) (2) and bis&#8208;selenide (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH(SePh)2) (3). The facile cleavage of the B&#8722;Se bond makes 2 a neutral source of selenium nucleophiles in substitutions reactions with benzyl bromides, and provide access to the corresponding selenoethers. The direct transformations of one of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds of C5F5N and C6F5CF3 to C&#8722;Se bonds have also been achieved by the use of 2 without employing transition&#8208;metal catalysts. While it was previously established that C6F6 could undergo complete defluoroselenation under harsh conditions, we successfully achieved partial defluorination of C6F6 by employing 2 as a mild selenide transfer reagent. During the formation of C&#8722;Se bonds through the cleavage of C&#8722;F bonds, the potential by&#8208;product NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2F undergoes ring expansion of the NHC, leading to the formation of the six&#8208;membered diaazafluoroborinane (7).

         <title>Cyclic Azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic hybrids of azobenzene and BODIPY 2B&#8211;8B were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction and following BF2 insertion. The structures of the representative hybrids were unambiguously revealed by single crystal diffraction analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation, and ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays depend upon the ring size and connectivity.







Abstract
Cyclic azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY hybrids were synthesized via cyclization by 1) acid&#8208;catalysed condensation of azobenzene&#8208;bridged dipyrroles with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzaldehyde, 2) oxidation with DDQ, and 3) metalation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O. The structures of many cyclic hybrids have been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation. The ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays of these cyclic hybrids depend upon the ring size and connectivity.

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Heteronuclear Fe&#8722;Mo Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) denoted as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) immobilized within the pores of g&#8208;C3N4 was designed by density functional theory computations, aiming to explore the nitrogen fixation activity of the Fe&#8722;Mo center and the influence of the coordination environment.







Abstract
Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8722;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g&#8208;C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6&#8722;aXa DACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of &#8722;0.11&#8197;V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1&#8242;s high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments.

         <title>Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8722;H Sulfonylation and Thiocyanation of Fused Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones in an All&#8208;Green Electrolytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical oxidative method for forming C&#8722;S bonds at the C3 position in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones using sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate has been developed. This method does not require any of the additional reagents or hazardous solvents, such as supporting electrolytes, HFIP, additives, or catalysts.







Abstract
An electrooxidative C&#8722;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non&#8208;recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and an electrolyte&#8208;free process has yet to be developed. This work demonstrates that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all&#8208;green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8722;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be selectively converted into C3&#8208;sulfonylated and &#8208;thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Understanding the Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals Formation Process: The Conversion from Heptazine to Triazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium chloride is a decisive factor in converting heptazine&#8208;based Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 into triazine&#8208;based PTI, thereby leads to a drastic change in physicochemical properties and achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) (PTI) generally obtained via ionothermal synthesis features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhanced crystallinity. However, in&#8208;depth investigation of the polycondensation process for PTI is an onerous task due to multiple influencing factors and limited characterization techniques. Herein, to simplify the polymerization route and exclude non&#8208;essential factors, PTI was prepared by calcining only melamine and LiCl. This study aims to identify the pivotal role of LiCl in PTI formation, which can convert heptazine&#8208;based intermediates into more stable triazine&#8208;based PTI framework. Based on this discovery, we demonstrate the transformation process of the prepared samples from amorphous Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 to regular PTI, and further prove that the reaction with LiCl causes disruption of heptazine covalent organic frameworks. Additionally, the PTI exhibits higher photocatalytic water splitting performance due to efficient charge carrier mobility and separation, as well as faster reaction kinetics. This discovery deepens understanding of the polycondensation process of PTI crystals and provides insights toward the rational design of crystalline carbon nitride&#8208;based semiconductors.

         <title>The impact of stoichiometry on the initial steps of crystal formation: Stability and lifetime of charged triple&#8208;ion complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minerals form in nature from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion&#8208;ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically, Ba(SO4)22&#8208; had higher association constants and its lifetime was twofold longer than Ba2SO42+. Similar trends were observed for BaCO3 and CaSO4. Contrastingly, for CaCO3, Ca(CO3)22&#8208; had lower association constants and its lifetime was shorter than Ca2CO32+. These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.</dc:description>

These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non-stoichiometric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simple Air&#8208;Stable [3]Radialene Anion Radicals as Environmentally Switchable Catholytes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ester&#8208;substituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize in solutions of water. The dimerization mode is structure specific and can be controlled by using heat, solvent, and salt. These results provide guidance for increasing the capacity of aqueous redox flow batteries containing radialene catholytes. A buildup of &#963;&#8208;dimer prevents stable charge&#8211;discharge cycling. The formation of &#960;&#8208;dimers through the addition of salt increases the stability of the charged species.







Abstract
The hexacyano[3]radialene radical anion (1) is an attractive catholyte material for use in redox flow battery (RFB) applications. The substitution of cyano groups with ester moieties enhances solubility while maintaining redox reversibility and favorable redox potentials. Here we show that these ester&#8208;functionalized, hexasubstituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in water. The dimerization mode is dependent on the substitution pattern and can be switched in solution. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved by exploiting an unprecedented tristate switching mechanism, wherein the radical can be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a &#963;&#8208;dimer&#8208;each with dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties&#8208;by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity. The symmetric, triester&#8208;tricyano[3]radialene (3) forms a solvent&#8208;responsive, &#963;&#8208;dimer in water that converts to the radical anion with the addition of organic solvents or to a &#960;&#8208;dimer in brine solutions. Diester&#8208;tetracyano[3]radialene (2) exists primarily as a &#960;&#8208;dimer in aqueous solutions and a radical anion in organic solvents. The dimerization behavior of both 2 and 3 is temperature dependent in methanol solutions. Dimerization equilibrium has a direct impact on catholyte stability during galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling in static H&#8208;cells. Specifically, conditions that favor the free radical anion or &#960;&#8208;dimer exhibit significantly enhanced cycling profiles.

         <title>10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Level TiNb2O7 Secondary Particles for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast charging: 10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;level TiNb2O7 secondary particle consisting of initial 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;m TiNb2O7 active particle with high crystallinity was successfully fabricated. The small number of particle&#8208;stacking layers with high conductivity could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance within the electrode, which enabled the outstanding fast&#8208;charging performance of 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level full cells.







Abstract
TiNb2O7 with Wadsley&#8211;Roth phase delivers double theoretical specific capacity and similar working potential in comparison to spinel Li4Ti5O12, the commercial high&#8208;rate anode material, and thus can enable much higher energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the inter&#8208;particle resistance within the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading TiNb2O7 electrode would impede the capacity release for practical application, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Herein, 10&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;size carbon&#8208;coated TiNb2O7 secondary particle (SP&#8208;TiNb2O7) consisting of initial micro&#8208;scale TiNb2O7 particles (MP&#8208;TiNb2O7) was fabricated. The high crystallinity of active material could enable fast&#8208;charge diffusion and electrochemical reaction rate within particles, and the small number of stacking layers of SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance that regular particle electrode often possess and achieve high compaction density of electrodes with high mass loading. The investigation on materials structure and electrochemical reaction kinetics verified the advances of the as&#8208;fabricated SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 in achieving superior electrochemical performance. The SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 exhibited high reversible capacity of 292.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the potential range of 1&#8211;3&#8197;V (Li+/Li) at 0.1&#8197;C, delivering high&#8208;capacity release of 94.3&#8201;%, and high capacity retention of 86&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C for 250&#8197;cycles in half cell configuration. Particularly, the advances of such an anode were verified in practical 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level laminated full pouch cell. The as&#8208;assembled LiFePO4||TiNb2O7 full cell exhibited a high capacity of 5.08&#8197;Ah at high charging rate of 6&#8197;C (77.9&#8201;% of that at 0.2&#8197;C of 6.52&#8197;Ah), as well as an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0352&#8201;% for 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C, suggesting the great potential for practical fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cyclometalatedgold(III)&#8208;hydride under oriented external electric fields: a new strategy to modulate its reactivity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selected gold complexes have been regarded as promising anti&#8208;cancer agents because they can bind with protein targets containing thiol or selenol moieties, but their clinical applications were hindered by the unbiased binding towards off&#8208;target thiol&#8208;proteins. Recently, a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex (abbreviated as 1) with visible light&#8208;induced thiol reactivity has been reported as potent photo&#8208;activated anticancer agents (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 132, 11139). To explore new strategies to stimuli this potential antitumor drug, the effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on its geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity was systematically investigated. Results reveal that imposing external electric fields along the Au&#8208;H bond of 1 can effectively activate this bond, which is conducive to its dissociation and the binding of Au site to potential targets. Hence, this study provides a new OEEF&#8208;strategy to activate this reported gold(III)&#8208;hydride, revealing its potential application in electrochemical therapy. We anticipate this work could promote the development of more electric field&#8208;activated anticancer agents. However, further experimental research should be conducted to verify the conclusions obtained in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biphenyl&#8208;Bridged &#1013;&#8208;Sultams by Organocatalytic Mannich Reactions of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylimines with Unactivated Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
Biphenyl&#8208;bridged &#1013;&#8208;sultams with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic Mannich reactions of seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with unactivated methyl alkyl ketones. Unactivated ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates will gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective Mannich reaction of biphenyl&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with methyl alkyl ketones is disclosed in this study. The reaction was performed under organocatalysis by using a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine as the catalyst in combination with a Br&#248;nsted acid as the co&#8208;catalyst. High yields (up to 89&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were observed. For methyl alkyl ketones containing a larger alkyl substituent, specific regioselective addition to the C=N bond is favored at the methyl group. On the contrary, ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Starbons&#174;: Methodology Development and Carbon Dioxide Capture Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen doping: Glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide are used as sustainable nitrogen sources in the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174;. Doping using microwave heating more effectively incorporates nitrogen than thermal heating in vacuo. The nitrogen&#8208;doped materials have superior carbon dioxide adsorption capacities and enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen selectivities compared to undoped Starbon&#174;.







Abstract
Five nitrogen sources (glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide) and three heating methods (thermal, monomodal microwave and multimodal microwave) are used to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; derived from starch. The materials are initially produced at 250&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C (SNx300y), then heated in vacuo to 800&#8201;&#176;C to produce nitrogen&#8208;doped SNx800y&#8217;s. Melamine gives the highest nitrogen incorporation without destroying the Starbon&#174; pore structure and the microwave heating methods give higher nitrogen incorporations than thermal heating. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; determined gravimetrically, in many cases exceed those of S300 and S800. The carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane adsorption isotherms of the most promising materials are measured volumetrically. Most of the nitrogen&#8208;doped materials show higher carbon dioxide adsorption capacities than S800, but lower methane and nitrogen adsorption capacities. As a result, the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; exhibit significantly enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen and methane versus nitrogen selectivities compared to S800.

         <title>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes: Strategies for Syntheses of Configurationally Stable, Electronically and Sterically Tunable Ambiphiles with Multiple Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic strategies to the rigid, multiple reactive, tunable and versatile applicable title compounds are reviewed, including various o&#8208;metalation procedures followed by direct P&#8722;C coupling or phospho&#8208;Fries rearrangements, UV&#8208; or transition&#8208;metal mediated couplings, addition reactions of PH&#8208;reactants at quinones or intermediate arynes, and thermal or photo&#8208;induced decomposition of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates.







Abstract
o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes are fascinating compounds by their multiple&#8208;reactivity features, attributed to the ambident hard and soft Lewis&#8208; and also Br&#248;nstedt acid&#8208;base properties, wide tuning opportunities via backbone substituents with &#177;mesomeric and inductive, at P and in o&#8208;position to P and O also steric effects, and in addition, the configurational stability at three&#8208;valent phosphorus. Air sensitivity may be overcome by reversible protection with BH3, but the easy oxidation to P(V)&#8208;compounds may also be used. Since the first reports on the title compounds ca. 50&#8197;years ago the multiple reactivity has led to versatile applications. This includes various P&#8722;E&#8722;O and P=C&#8722;O heterocycles, a multitude of O&#8208;substituted derivatives including acyl derivatives for traceless Staudinger couplings of biomolecules with labels or functional substituents, phosphane&#8208;phosphite ligands, which like the o&#8208;phosphanylphenols itself form a range of transition metal complexes and catalysts. Also main group metal complexes and (bi)arylphosphonium&#8208;organocatalysts are derived. Within this review the various strategies for the access of the starting materials are illuminated, including few hints to selected applications.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Highly Crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333) was synthesized through a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis. With this crystalline product, it was possible for the first time to elucidate the crystal structure of LiMoS2 by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The arrangement of Mo atoms in the b&#8208;c plane confirms a predicted Peierls distortion.







Abstract
LixMoS2 is not only a lithium battery material, but is also an important precursor for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials. Current syntheses of MoS2, such as in n&#8208;butyllithium/LiBH4 or electrochemically, are not satisfying in terms of defined stoichiometry and crystallinity, so an accurate experimental crystal structure determination of this important and widely used material has been long awaited. A high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis yielded highly crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333). 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LiMoS2 crystallizes in the space group P
 with a=6.2482(3)&#8197;&#197;, b=6.6336(3)&#8197;&#197;, c=6.7480(3)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=119.321(2)&#176;, &#946;=90.010(2)&#176; and &#947;=90.077(2)&#176;. The arrangement of Mo atoms within the b&#8208;c&#8208;plane confirmed a predicted Peierls distortion. A similar atom distribution pattern to that of Mo is also observed for the lithium atoms. Calculation of bond valence site energies gave an activation barrier of 1.244&#8197;eV for 2D lithium&#8208;ion migration. For x=1.333, a phase&#8208;pure synthesis was achieved.

         <title>Copper&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of O&#8208;Benzoylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;mediated electrophilic amination methodology has been developed to provide access to a range of structurally diverse N&#8722;CF3 amines in good to moderate yields. The method proceeds under mild reaction conditions utilizing inexpensive reagents in an operationally simple manner.







Abstract
The use of trifluoromethyl containing compounds is well established within medicinal chemistry, with a range of approved drugs containing C&#8722;CF3 and O&#8722;CF3 moieties. However, the utilisation of the N&#8722;CF3 functional group remains relatively unexplored. This may be attributed to the challenging synthesis of this unit, with many current methods employing harsh conditions or less accessible reagents. A robust methodology for the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of secondary amines has been developed, which employs an umpolung strategy in the form of a copper&#8208;catalysed electrophilic amination. The method is operationally simple, uses mild, inexpensive reagents, and has been used to synthesise a range of novel, structurally complex N&#8722;CF3 containing compounds.

         <title>An Investigation of Allyl&#8208;Substituted Bis(Diphosphine) Iron Complexes: Towards Precursors for Cooperative CO2 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the development of homogenous catalysts capable of selective CO2 reduction, factors that impact CO2 coordination mode and downstream reactivity are of interest. This work presents the synthesis of novel Fe compounds bearing unsaturated diphosphine ligands, their reactivity with CO2, and a theoretical exploration of cooperative CO2 activation using a boron&#8208;rich secondary coordination sphere.







Abstract
In developing homogenous catalysts capable of CO2 activation, interaction with a metal center is often imperative. This work provides primary efforts towards the cooperative activation of CO2 using a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and iron via a paired theoretical/experimental approach. Specifically, this study reports efforts towards [Fe(diphosphine)2(N2)] as a CO2&#8208;coordinated synthon where diphosphine=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;cyclohexylboranyl)propylphosphino)ethane) (P2BCy4) or its precursor, 1,2&#8208;bis(diallylphosphino)ethane (tape). Initial efforts toward the {Fe(0)&#8208;N2} complex were focused on deprotonation reactions of [Fe(diphosphine)2(H)(NCCH3)]+ and reduction of [Fe(tape)2Cl2]. In the latter case, a mixture of intramolecularly &#960;&#8208;bonded alkene and associated metallacyclic Fe(II)&#8212;H species were produced &#8211; heating this mixture provided the hydride as the major product. Notably, the interconversion of this pair counters that of related intermolecular reactions between [Fe(depe)2] (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) and ethylene, where hydride formation occurs subsequent to &#960;&#8208;coordination; this has been probed by theoretical calculations. Finally, reactivity of the metallacyclic {Fe(II)&#8212;H} complex with CO2 was probed, resulting in a pair of isomeric ferra(II)lactones.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Mn(II)&#8208;complex Catalyzed Switchable De(hydrogenative) Csp3&#8208;H Functionalization of Methyl Heteroarenes: A Sustainable Approach for Diversification of Heterocyclic Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of methyl heteroarenes employing one single air, moisture stable and cost effective Mn(II) bridge complex has been demonstrated. Seven different types of heteroarenes are functionalized using various aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols with good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Catalytic activities of Mn(I) complexes derived from expensive MnBr(CO)5 salt have been explored in various dehydrogenative transformations. However, the reactivity and selectivity of inexpensive high spin Mn(II) complexes are uncommon. Herein, we have synthesized four new Mn(II) complexes and explored switchable alkenylation and alkylation of methyl heteroarenes employing a single Mn(II)catalyst. The developed protocol selectively furnishes a series of functionalized E&#8208;heteroarenes and C&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes with good to excellent yields. Various medicinally and synthetically useful compounds are successfully synthesized using our developed protocol. Various controls and kinetics experiments were executed to shed light on the mechaism,which reveals that &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond breaking of alcohol is the slowest step.

         <title>Understanding the Electronic Structure of Magnetic Trinuclear Complexes Based on the Tris&#8208;dioxolene Triphenylene Non&#8208;innocent Bridging Ligand, a Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic properties of trinuclear complexes based on the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8722; is independent from both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions, when it is in the full semiquinone state. They are governed only by the electronic structure of HHTP3&#8722; that can be qualitatively inferred from the analysis of the X&#8208;ray structure of the related complexes.







Abstract
A complete theoretical analysis using first the simple H&#252;ckel model followed by more sophisticated multi&#8208;reference calculations on a trinuclear Ni(II) complex (Tp#Ni3HHTP), bearing the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8722;, is carried out. The three semiquinone moieties of HHTP3&#8722; couple antiferromagnetically and lead to a single unpaired electron localized on one of the moieties. The calculated exchange coupling integrals together with the zero&#8208;field parameters allow, when varied within a certain range, reproducing the experimental data. These results are generalized for two similar other trinuclear complexes containing Ni(II) and Cu(II). The electronic structure of HHTP3&#8722; turns out to be independent of both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions. We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non&#8208;innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X&#8208;ray structure.

         <title>Diversification of Simple Arenes into Complex (Amino)cyclitols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic approach for accessing complex natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes. A key feature includes the application of a dearomative functionalization with arenophiles and subsequent diversification, generating a widespread library of compounds spanning far into underexplored chemical space.







Abstract
Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. This work reports the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations. Practical guidelines were developed for the synthesis of natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes through a series of strategic functionalization events.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. This work reports the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations. Practical guidelines were developed for the synthesis of natural and non-natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes through a series of strategic functionalization events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Metallation of Dendralenes and Myrcene using Dimagnesium(I) Compounds: A Facile Route to Unsaturated Organomagnesium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing dendralenes: The reduction of [4]dendralene and related substituted butadienes with dimagnesium(I) compounds has given a series of unsaturated organo&#8208;magnesium complexes (see picture, L=bulky N,N&#8208;chelating amide). Reaction of two of these with H2 and/or CO leads to the assembly of the substrates, affording value&#8208;added organic products.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron reduction of 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (DMB) with &#946;&#8208;diketiminate and guanidinate substituted dimagnesium(I) compounds has given complexes in which two bidentate amido&#8208;magnesium fragments are bridged through the &#960;&#8208;system of the DMB dianion, viz. [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] (L=XylNacnac, [HC(MeCNXyl)2]&#8722;, Xyl=2,6&#8208;xylyl; or Priso=[(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Similar double reductions of [4]dendralene (4dend) have afforded the complexes, [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (L=ArNacnac, Ar=Xyl or mesityl (Mes); or Priso) in which the 4dend dianion is &#960;&#8208;coordinated to the bidentate amido&#8208;magnesium fragments. Treatment of several such complexes with THF leads to Z&#8208; to E&#8208;isomerization of the dendralene fragment, and formation of purely &#963;&#8208;bonded Mg&#8722;C interactions in the THF coordinated products [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (Ar=Xyl, Mes or Dip). Reaction of myrcene (Myr) with [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2] proceeds via reductive coupling of Myr to give a previously unknown acyclic, branched C20 tetra&#8208;olefin dianion complex [{(XylNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;Myr)2]. Preliminary reactions of [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] with H2 and/or CO yielded a series of products, including novel magnesium hydride compounds, products derived from couplings of CO with the reduced DMB fragment (viz. magnesium dimethylcyclohexadienediolates), and one magnesium cyclopropanetriolate complex from the magnesium(I) induced coupling of DMB with H2 and CO.

         <title>Rebound or Cage Escape? The Role of the Rebound Barrier for the Reactivity of Non&#8208;Heme High&#8208;Valent FeIV=O species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of ligand design to modulate rebound barriers in order to achieve efficient and selective hydroxylation reactions with high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species is revealed.







Abstract
Owing to their high reactivity and selectivity, variations in the spin ground state and a range of possible pathways, high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species are popular models with potential bioinspired applications. An interesting example of a structure&#8211;reactivity pattern is the detailed study with five nonheme amine&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand FeIV=O species, including N4py: [(L1)FeIV=O]2+ (1), bntpen: [(L2)FeIV=O]2+ (2), py2tacn: [(L3)FeIV=O]2+ (3), and two isomeric bispidine derivatives: [(L4)FeIV=O]2+ (4) and [(L5)FeIV=O]2+ (5). In this set, the order of increasing reactivity in the hydroxylation of cyclohexane differs from that with cyclohexadiene as substrate. A comprehensive DFT, ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) study is presented to untangle the observed patterns. These are well reproduced when both activation barriers for the C&#8722;H abstraction and the OH rebound are taken into account. An MO, NBO and deformation energy analysis reveals the importance of &#960;(pyr) &#8594; &#960;*xz(FeIII&#8208;OH) electron donation for weakening the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and thus reducing the rebound barrier. This requires that pyridine rings are oriented perpendicularly to the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and this is a subtle but crucial point in ligand design for non&#8208;heme iron alkane hydroxylation.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogs of Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite its great potential for the synthesis of 1&#8208;chiral phosphonates, the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) and deuteration (ATD) of 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates are poorly studied reactions. Like in a pinball machine, one can aim at a variety of different target structures and combine many different pathways in a robust and reliable way. The bonuses to be collected on this synthetic high&#8208;speed line towards 1&#8208;aminophosphonic acids include high enantiomeric excesses, yields and degrees of deuteration. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Pallitsch and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302171).

         <dc:description>Red luminescent materials are essential components for full color display and white lightening based on organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, but the extension of emission color towards red or deep red region generally leads to decreased photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies. Herein, we wish to report two new luminescent molecules (2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA) consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors. As the increase of cyano substituents, the emission wavelength is greatly red&#8208;shifted and the reverse intersystem crossing process is promoted, resulting in strong red delayed fluorescence. Meanwhile, due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the molecular structures become rigidified and planarized, which brings about large horizontal dipole ratios. As a result, 2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA can perform as emitters efficiently in OLEDs, furnishing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8% at 616 nm and 20.4% at 648 nm, which are significantly improved in comparison with that of the control molecule without cyano substituents. The findings in this work demonstrate that the introduction of cyano substituents to the acceptors of delayed fluorescence molecules could be a facile and effective approach to explore high&#8208;efficiency red or deep red delayed fluorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Studies of &#946;&#8208;Azapeptoid Foldamers: A New Class of Peptidomimetics with Confined Dihedrals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids with confined backbone dihedrals were synthesized. These molecules adopted trans amide geometries (&#969; ~180&#176;) with their &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions confined in narrow ranges (170&#8211;180&#176;). Their &#981;(C&#946;&#8208;N) can also be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the &#946;&#8208;carbon, which provide control over their backbone dihedrals.







Abstract
Controlling amide bond geometries and the secondary structures of &#946;&#8208;peptoids is a challenging task as they contain several rotatable single bonds in their backbone. Herein, we describe the synthesis and conformational properties of novel &#8220;&#946;&#8208;azapeptoids&#8221; with confined dihedrals. We discuss how the acylhydrazide sidechains in these molecules enforce trans amide geometries (&#969; ~180&#176;) via steric and stereoelectronic effects. We also show that the &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids occupy a narrow range (170&#8211;180&#176;) that can be rationalized by the staggered conformational preference of the backbone methylene carbons and a novel backbone nO&#8594;&#963;*C&#946;&#8208;N interaction discovered in this study. However, the &#981; (C&#946;&#8208;N) torsion remains freely rotatable and, depending on &#981;, the sidechains can be parallel, perpendicular, and anti&#8208;parallel relative to each other. In fact, we observed parallel and perpendicular relative orientations of sidechains in the crystal geometries of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoid dimers. We show that &#981; of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids can be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the backbone &#946;&#8208;carbon, which could provide complete control over all the backbone dihedrals. Finally, we show that the &#981; and &#936; dihedrals of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids resemble that of a PPII helix and they retain PPII structure when incorporated in Host&#8211;guest proline peptides.

         <title>[3+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates and in&#160;situ Generated&#160;Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable [3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in situ generated unstabilized azomethine ylide is reported for the first time. The selective formation of either 1:1 or 1:2 cycloaddition products was achieved by carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, mainly by controlling the reactant stoichiometry, catalyst loading, and internal temperature. The developed protocol tolerated many valuable functional groups, including TMS, protected alcohol (as ether or THP derivatives), or aldehyde (as acetal). Further common C&#8211;C and C &#8211; heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, as well as scaled&#8208;up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting the Antifungal Activity of Carbon Dots against Candida albicans&#160;Biofilm Formation by Tailoring Their Surface Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging class of carbon nanoparticles, which for their characteristics have found applications in many fields such as catalysis, materials and biomedicine. Within this context, the application of CDs as antibacterial agents has received much attention in very recent years, while their use as antifungal nanoparticles has been scarcely investigated. Here we report a systematic investigation of the surface functional groups of CDs to study their influence on these nanoparticles&#8217; against Candida albicans. Three classes of CDs have been synthesised and fully characterized. A thorough in vitro and in vivo biological screening against C. albicans was performed to test their antifungal, antiadhesion and antibiofilm formation activities. Moreover, the interaction with C. albicans cells was investigated by microscopic analysis. Our results evidence how the presence of a positively polarised surface results crucial for the internalization into COS&#8208;7 cells. Positively charged nanoparticles were also able to inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation, to interact with the cellular membrane of C. albicans, and to increase the survival of G. mellonella infected larvae after the injection with positive nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of CDs and their extremely low toxicity may represent a new strategy to combat infections sustained by C.albicans.</dc:description>

         <title>Scaffold Editing of Cubanes into Homocubanes; Homocuneanes via Cuneanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of cage&#8208;type hydrocarbons through the editing of the highly symmetric molecule cubane can be anticipated as one of the efficient approaches. In this paper, we identify a catalyst that facilitates the efficient scaffold isomerization of cubanes into homocubanes. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;diacyloxymethylcubane results in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. The same catalyst was also applied to the isomerization of acyloxymethylcuneanes, producing homocuneanol esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Alkyl&#8208;Locked Axial Chirality Scaffold by Restriction of Molecular Motions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure&#8208;property relationship studies on a newly&#8208;developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl&#8208;chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10&#8208;4 to 10&#8208;1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)&#8208;4C in solution to (R)&#8208;1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though&#8208;out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high&#8208;performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#183;4H2O (Ir&#8208;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 400 nm) reached 99.5%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8208;SiW.</dc:description>

         <title>A pseudo&#8208;Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Built upon Layered Double Hydroxides with Self&#8208;Strengthening Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While great achievements have been made in the development of mechanically robust nanocomposite hydrogels, incorporating multiple interactions on the bases of two demensional inorganic cross&#8208;linkers to construct self&#8208;strengthening hydrogels has rarely been investigated. To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions within a pseudo double&#8208;network system. The pseudo first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris&#8208;modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8208;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non&#8208;covalent interactions between Tris&#8208;LDHs and poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;propanesulfonate) (p&#8208;(AM&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9 wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90 % of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self&#8208;recovery and self&#8208;strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling N2 to Ammonia Conversion in Bi2WO6&#8208;Based Materials: A New Avenue in Photocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic N2 fixation is an emerging application for ammonia production via sustainable means. N2 gas activation onto the photocatalyst remains a challenge for current researchers. This concept summarizes the latest developments in this field in Bi2WO6&#8208;based photocatalysts for enhancing N2 chemisorption for maximum ammonia production. The final of this concept mentioned the possible problems with false ammonia quantification and how to do rectification.







Abstract
The field of photocatalysis has been evolving since 1972 since Honda and Fujishima's initial push for using light as an energy source to accomplish redox reactions. Since then, many photocatalysts have been studied, semiconductors or otherwise. A new photocatalytic application to convert N2 gas to ammonia (N2 fixation or nitrogen reduction reaction; NRR) has emerged. Many researchers have steered their research in this direction due to developments in the ease of ammonia detection through UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This concept will specifically discuss Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials, techniques to enhance their photocatalytic activity (CO2 reduction, H2 production, pollutant removal, etc.), and their current application in photocatalytic NRR. Initially, a brief introduction of Bi2WO6 along with its VB and CB potentials will be compared to various redox potentials. A final topic of interest would be a brief description of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation with additional consideration to Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials in N2 fixation. A major problem with photocatalytic NRR is the false ammonia quantification in Bi&#8208;based materials, which will be discussed in detail and also ways to minimize them.

         <title>Hydroelementation and Phosphinidene Transfer: Reactivity of Phosphagermenes and Phosphastannenes Towards Small Molecule Substrates</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with a phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent is described. Reactivity studies reveal that they are capable of undergoing hydroelementation reactions across the E=P bond and of acting as masked phosphinidene sources.







Abstract
We describe the facile synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with the phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent, Me3P&#8722;PMes*. Their reactivity towards a range of substrates with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds (E=N, O, Si) is described. In addition to hydroelementation reactions of the E=P bonds, we show that these compounds, particularly [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn=PMes*, also act as base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes, allowing phosphinidene transfer to other nucleophiles.

         <title>Solvent Acts as the Referee in a Match&#8208;Up Between Charged and Preorganized Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent dependent binding: Herein, a cationic receptor was employed to quantify chloride binding in solvents of differing polarity and draw comparison to a neutral, preorganized macrocycle. As expected, ion&#8208;ion attraction leads to stronger binding but only in low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane. Unexpectedly, the neutral receptor wins the competition for binding in polar solvents due to being preorganized.







Abstract
The prevalence of anion&#8208;cation contacts in biomolecular recognition under aqueous conditions suggests that ionic interactions should dominate the binding of anions in solvents across both high and low polarities. Investigations of this idea using titrations in low polarity solvents are impaired by interferences from ion pairing that prevent a clear picture of binding. To address this limitation and test the impact of ion&#8208;ion interactions across multiple solvents, we quantified chloride binding to a cationic receptor after accounting for ion pairing. In these studies, we created a chelate receptor using aryl&#8208;triazole CH donors and a quinolinium unit that directs its cationic methyl inside the binding pocket. In low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 7.3) is more stable than neutral chelates, but fortuitously comparable to a preorganized macrocycle (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 6.9). Polar acetonitrile and DMSO diminish stabilities of the charged receptor (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 3.7 and 1.9) but surprisingly 100&#8208;fold more than the macrocycle. While both receptors lose stability by dielectric screening of electrostatic stability, the cationic receptor also pays additional costs of organization. Thus even though the charged receptor has stronger binding in apolar solvents, the uncharged receptor has more anion affinity in polar solvents.

         <title>Second Generation of Near&#8208;Infrared Cyanine&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Faster Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities in oxidation (aza&#8208;Henry reaction) and reduction (trifluoromethylation of alkene).







Abstract
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities. Catalyst efficiency was determined by using two model oxidation and reduction reactions. For the aza&#8208;Henry reaction, cyanines bearing an amino group on the heptamethine chain led to the best results. For trifluoromethylation, the stability of the photocatalyst was found to be the key parameter for efficient and rapid conversion.

For the aza-Henry reaction, cyanines bearing an amino group on the heptamethine chain led to the best results. For trifluoromethylation, the stability of the photocatalyst was found to be the key parameter for efficient and rapid conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Flexible and Self&#8208;Healing Supercapacitor Enabled by Physically Crosslinking Polymer Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with outstanding mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing ability based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability, retaining 80&#8201;% specific capacitance after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. Three supercapacitors in series could drive a parallel circuit of LED and clock.







Abstract
Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self&#8208;healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross&#8208;linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self&#8208;healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723&#8201;%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8&#8197;mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8197;situ growth of electrode film, a non&#8208;laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability. Due to the non&#8208;laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1&#8197;mF/cm2 and the capacitance retention was 80&#8201;% after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. The pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self&#8208;healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self&#8208;healing.

         <title>Chiral TPE Foldamers in Macrocycles: Aggregation Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral TPE foldamers were first constructed through macrocycle architectonics and the chiroptical properties were investigated. Aggregation enhanced emission and unusual circularly polarized luminescence can be discovered due to the folded conformation.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted increasing attention due to the rigid structure, symmetrical chiral geometry and large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). However, most chiral macrocycles are more emissive in solutions but have weakened fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) in aggregates, limiting their further application. In this paper, chiral macrocycle R/S&#8208;PhTPE was synthesized by combining chiral macrocycle architectonics with Z&#8208;o&#8208;phenyltetraphenylethylene (PhTPE) foldamer. Enhanced solution state emission and characteristic aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) effect can be observed for R/S&#8208;PhTPE due to the folded PhTPE conformation. Macrocycle immobilization and folded conformation endow PhTPE moiety with stable helical conformation. Most importantly, R/S&#8208;PhTPE exhibits opposite CPL signals compared with common chiral TPEs, demonstrating the evident impact of folded conformation. This work reports the first and deep insights into the chiroptical properties of chiral PhTPE foldamers, and will provide a new strategy to tune &#934;F and CPL signals of AIE active chiral macrocycles.

         <title>Yet Another Case of Lithium Metal Atoms and Germanium Atoms Sharing Chemistry in the Solid State: Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Ba2LiGe3</title>

The structure of Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x, emphasizing the honeycomb&#8208;like [Li1&#8722;xGe3+x] layers with Li and Ge atoms (denoted in blue and gold) in a partially disordered state.







Abstract
Several Ba&#8722;Li&#8722;Ge ternary phases are known and structurally characterized, including the title compound Ba2LiGe3. Its structure is reported to contain [Ge6]10&#8722; anions that exhibit delocalized bonding with a H&#252;ckel&#8208;like aromatic character. The Ge atoms are in the same plane with the Li atoms, and if both types of atoms are considered as covalently bonded, [LiGe3]4&#8722; honeycomb&#8208;like layers will result. The latter are separated by slabs of Ba2+ cations. However, based on the systematic work detailed herein, it is necessary to re&#8208;evaluate the phase as Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x (x&lt;0.05). Although small, the homogeneity range is clearly demonstrated in the gradual change of the unit cell for four independent samples. Subsequent characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods shows that the Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x structure, responds to the varied number of valence electrons and the changes are most pronounced for the refined lengths of the Li&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge bonds. Indirectly, the changes in the Ge&#8722;Li/Ge distances within layers affect the stacking too, and these changes can be correlated to the variation of the c&#8208;cell parameter. Chemical bonding analysis based on TB&#8208;LMTO&#8208;ASA level calculations affirms the notion for covalent character of the Ge&#8722;Ge bonds; the Ba&#8722;Ge and Li&#8722;Ge interactions also show some degree of covalency.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOFs with Enriched Surface Bi Active Sites for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOF with enriched surface Bi active sites were obtained by modulating the crystal facet ingeniously. The knitting of Bi active sites onto the porphyrin ligands with the exposure of rich Bi sites can not only ameliorate the light absorption, but also stabilize the catalytic active sites and promote efficient ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, for significantly ameliorating the performance of photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4.







Abstract
The inherent challenges in using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the combination of wide&#8208;range light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transfer as well as highly exposed catalytic active sites for CO2 activation and reduction. We present here a promising solution to satisfy these requirements together by modulating the crystal facet and surface atomic structure of a porphyrin&#8208;based bismuth&#8208;MOF (Bi&#8208;PMOF). The series of structural and photo&#8208;electronic characterizations together with photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment collectively establish that the enriched Bi active sites on the (010) surface prefer to promote efficient charge separation and transfer as well as the activation and reduction of CO2. Specifically, the Bi&#8208;PMOFs&#8208;120&#8208;F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimal photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to CO (28.61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1) and CH4 (8.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group p&#8208;block metal Bi&#8208;MOF photocatalysts for CO2 reduction through a facet&#8208;regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure&#8208;activity relationships of the MOFs.

Specifically, the Bi-PMOFs-120-F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimal photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction performance to CO (28.61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (8.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-block metal Bi-MOF photocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction through a facet-regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure-activity relationships of the MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks as Tailor&#8208;Made Scaffolds for Water Harvesting</title>

Water harvesting from the air: three covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized by incorporating different content of nitrogen. Higher nitrogen content is advantageous to lower their inflection points in water isotherms. The high performance of these COFs validated the feasibility of harnessing this strategy to prepare efficient COFs&#8208;based water harvesters.







Abstract
Developing materials to harvest water from the air is of great importance to alleviate the water shortage for people living in arid regions, where the annual average relative humidity (RH) is lower than 0.4. In this work, we report a general nitrogen atom incorporation strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for water harvesting from the air in arid areas. A series of COFs, namely COF&#8208;W1, COF&#8208;W2, and COF&#8208;W3 were developed for this purpose. Different contents of nitrogen were embedded into COFs by incorporating pyridine units into the building blocks. With the increasing content of nitrogen from COF&#8208;W1 to COF&#8208;W3, the inflection points of their water isotherms shift distinctly from RH values from 0.65 to 0.25. Significantly, COF&#8208;W3 exhibits the lowest inflection point at a low RH value of 0.25 and reaches a high uptake capacity of 0.28&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with a low hysteresis loop. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale COF&#8208;W3 retains its high performance, which renders it more attractive in water harvesting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this nitrogen incorporation strategy to acquire high&#8208;performance COFs as water harvesters in the future.

         <title>Long&#8208;range Through&#8208;space Charge Transfer in a pH&#8208;responsive Mixed Cyclophane of Pyridine and Teropyrene</title>

Long&#8208;distance relationship: two aromatic systems do not need to inhabit the same space to maintain a meaningful connection, as evidenced by the long&#8208;range (&gt;5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space charge transfer that arises upon protonation of the pyridine unit in a mixed [3.3]cyclophane containing a rainbow&#8208;shaped teropyrene and a pyridine nested in its arc.







Abstract
A large, strained (SE=44.2&#8197;kcal/mol) and conformationally flexible mixed cyclophane of pyridine and teropyrene was synthesized using two intramolecular Wurtz coupling reactions and an unprecedented Scholl reaction between the unreactive 2 positions of the pyrene systems in a triply bridged pyrenophane. Protonation of the pyridine unit results in a greatly enhanced preference for nesting in the cavity of the highly bent teropyrene system (&#952;calc=162.6&#176;) and emergence of a charge transfer absorption band (&#955;max=592&#8197;nm) due to a long range (5.0&#8211;5.5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space intramolecular transition between the teropyrene and pyridinium units, which does not exist in the neutral cyclophane.

         <title>Geometrically Deformed and Conformationally Rigid Phosphorus Trisamides Featuring an Unsymmetrical Backbone</title>

Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers an attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom. Current scaffolds are based on a relatively narrow set of ligand platforms. This work focusses on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform.







Abstract
Nonclassical P(III) centers have attracted much attention in recent years. Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers a particularly attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom that may in turn induce unusual reactivity. Although still relatively scarcely explored, phosphorus centers enforced in a non&#8208;C3 symmetry have gained significant traction lately. However, the current scaffolds are based on a relatively limited set of design principles and ligand platforms associated therewith. This work is focussed on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of a geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform derived from 2&#8208;(methylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylamino)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide.

         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>

The bromo derivatives of 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles and an indoline were converted to the corresponding phosphonoyl and phosphinoyl derivatives by the microwave&#8208;assisted &#8220;P&#8208;ligand&#8208;free&#8221; Hirao P&#8722;C coupling. A part of the fifteen phosphorylated N&#8208;heterocycles showed significant cytotoxic effect on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cell cultures.







Abstract
A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of these N&#8208;heterocycles were synthesized. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one, were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y=alkoxy, aryl) (30&#8201;%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, the presented method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84&#8201;% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in&#8197;vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect was significant as compared to that of the reference compounds.

Singling out the singlet: A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented based on the quenching of singlet oxygen. It proves singlet oxygen to be the key initiator in the oxidation of phosphines.







Abstract
A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented that contrasts with previous interpretations, which were limited to specific phosphines. This contribution shows the synthesis of a series of air&#8208;stable primary phosphines Fc(CH2)nPH2, where n=0,1,2,3; and Fc=ferrocenyl, and their corresponding isolable primary phosphine oxides. It was demonstrated that the ferrocene moiety exerts an antioxidant effect on the primary phosphine group, which is intermolecular, solvent dependent and increases with the electron density on the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of ferrocene in solution also inhibits the oxidation of other secondary and tertiary phosphines in air. Together our findings suggest that quenching of singlet oxygen is the actual reason for the antioxidant effect; this was experimentally confirmed by using other established singlet oxygen quenchers, thus demonstrating a key role of singlet oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of phosphines.

         <title>Structure and Flexibility of Copper&#8208;Modified DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes Investigated by 19F ENDOR Experiments at 34&#8197;GHz

19F ENDOR&#8208;based distance measurements at 34&#8197;GHz report on the structure and flexibility of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes. Our findings show that measuring precise distances at 34&#8197;GHz is feasible without the loss of sensitivity and resolution.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) are of great interest due to their involvement in crucial biological processes such as telomerase maintenance and gene expression. Furthermore, they are reported as catalytically active DNAzymes and building blocks in bio&#8208;nanotechnology. GQs exhibit remarkable structural diversity and conformational heterogeneity, necessitating precise and reliable tools to unravel their structure&#8208;function relationships. Here, we present insights into the structure and conformational flexibility of a unimolecular GQ with high spatial resolution via electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments combined with Cu(II) and fluorine labeling. These findings showcase the successful application of the 19F&#8208;ENDOR methodology at 34&#8197;GHz, overcoming the limitations posed by the complexity and scarcity of higher&#8208;frequency spectrometers. Importantly, our approach retains both sensitivity and orientational resolution. This integrated study not only enhances our understanding of GQs but also expands the methodological toolbox for studying other macromolecules.

         <title>Polymorphism and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>

New TPE derivatives bearing p&#8208;AP groups: Among 5 kinds of crystals of TPE derivative, it is found for the first time that strong intermolecular ArH&#8208;pi interactions cause ACQ effect while weak ArH&#8208;pi interactions induce AIE phenomenon. The interactions also arouse photochromism, photodeformation and even the first forward rolling movement of crystal by UV light irradiation, providing promising materials in multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Process in Resorcinarene&#8208;based Coordination Capsules</title>

Cu and Ag capsules accommodate various organic molecules. We investigated the processes by which these capsules perform molecular recognition utilizing a molecular probe. It was found that partial dissociation is a major molecular recognition process, while in some cases, slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation.







Abstract
Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in the Cu and Ag capsules by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and 1H NMR measurements reveal that the host&#8208;guest complexation proceeds under second&#8208;order reactions and that these capsules undergo the partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. The slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries p&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron&#8208;rich p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group and the electron&#8208;poor 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without the partial dissociation.

Single crystals of the NCAs of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) were grown, allowing a ring&#8208;opening polymerization macroscopically induced by amines. The single crystals could be polymerized at temperatures from 25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C after physically contacting the amine&#8208;based initiator with the crystals. Topochemical polymerization of the crystals was proven by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS and XRD, generating polymers with chain lengths of up to 40&#8197;units and a complete affixation of the initiating amine at the polymer's head. Due to the proper alignment of the reacting groups in the crystal, longer polymer chains with improved purities can be reached, as chain&#8208;transfer is reduced as compared to solution polymerization. Simple purification of the polymers can be achieved by separation of the unreacted NCA via dispersion in acetonitrile. Overall, this method enables the preparation of polymers with higher chain length and purities at mild conditions, finally demonstrating a crystal&#8208;based ring opening polymerization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The single&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;crystal ring&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;opening polymerization&lt;/b&gt; of &#945;-aminoisobutyric acid- (Aib) and 1-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid- (ACHC) N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) is reported. Topochemical, living ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of these achiral amino-acid NCAs produces polymers of highest purity with increased chain length and high end-group fidelity as compared to conventional solution polymerization.

         <title>Photophysical Properties of Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;Aggregate Assemblies Made of N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Derivatives</title>

Photophysical properties of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;aggregate: SEM image of homo&#8208;aggregated system (helical&#8208;shaped) of a covalently&#8208;linked dyad made of photoactive N&#8208;annulated perylene dyes and methylviologen electron acceptor units (P&#8208;MV). Hetero&#8208;aggregated systems containing P dye and P&#8208;MV dyad are also formed in appropriate conditions and the light absorbed by P contributes to photoinduced charge separation within the P&#8208;MV components.







Abstract
We report the absorption spectra and photophysical properties of homo and hetero&#8208;aggregate assemblies of a strongly emissive N&#8208;annulated perylene dye (P) and of a dyad made of P and a methyl viologen derivative (P&#8208;MV), in ethanol&#8208;water solutions. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P, the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* fluorescence of the isolated chromophore is replaced by excimer emission at lower energy, with a lifetime of 900&#8197;ps, due to excimer formation from the initially prepared excitons. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P&#8208;MV, photoinduced charge separation, with formation of P+&#8208;MV&#8722; species, occurs in 3&#8197;ps with a charge recombination of 20&#8197;ps. In hetero&#8208;aggregate P/P&#8208;MV systems, the light energy absorbed by the P components delocalizes over various P subunits, and when a P&#8208;MV unit is reached, charge separation occurs; however, excimer emission is present for P/P&#8208;MV ratio larger than 3&#8201;:&#8201;1, indicating that delocalized excitons within the hetero&#8208;aggregate systems extend over a limited number of P chromophores.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ru Nanoboxes with a Hexagonal Close&#8208;Packed Structure by Templating with Ag Nanocubes and Their Catalytic Properties</title>

Boxing clever: We report a facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8722;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes by templating with Ag nanocubes. The nanoboxes show high catalytic activity toward the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenol by NaBH4.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal nanoboxes offer an attractive form of nanomaterials for catalytic applications owing to their open structure and highly efficient use of atoms. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8722;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a solution of Ru(acac)3 in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise to a suspension of silver nanocubes in EG at 170&#8201;&#176;C, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the RuIII precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as&#8208;obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers. Finally, we evaluated the catalytic properties of the Ru nanoboxes with two different wall thicknesses by using a model hydrogenation reaction; both samples showed excellent performance.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties on a Bisbenzofuropyrazine Core: Mechanochromism and Concentration&#8208;Controlled Vapochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>

A novel &#960;&#8208;core system: bent&#8208;shaped bisbenzofuropyrazines were easily synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular double cyclization reaction. The unsubstituted derivative shows good solubility in spite of its rigid planar structure and provides three polymorphs with different mechanochromic luminescent properties. A ground sample of the sec&#8208;butylated derivative exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent unique vapochromic luminescent behavior.







Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with luminescence switching properties have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications in sensing, security, and display devices. In this paper, bent&#8208;type bisbenzofuropyrazine derivatives, Bent&#8208;H and Bent&#8208;sBu, with good solubilities were synthesized, and their physical and optical properties were investigated in detail. Bent&#8208;H gave three crystalline polymorphs, and they showed different luminescence properties depending on their crystal packing structures. In addition, Bent&#8208;H exhibited mechanochromic luminescence in spite of its rigid skeleton. Bent&#8208;sBu exhibited unique concentration&#8208;dependent vapochromic luminescence. Ground Bent&#8208;sBu was converted to blue&#8208;emissive, green&#8208;emissive, and green&#8208;emissive high&#8208;viscosity solution states at low, moderate, and high concentrations of CHCl3 vapor, respectively. This finding represents a concentration&#8208;dependent multi&#8208;phase transition with an organic solvent, which is of potent interest for application in sensing systems.

         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode could efficiently electrocatalytic reduce CO2 to CO in CO2&#8208;saturated 30&#8197;wt% [Bmim]PF6&#8208;65&#8197;wt% CH3CN&#8208;5&#8197;wt% H2O electrolyte. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode was closely associated with its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. Surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction. Herein, hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.&#8201;e.

The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO.

The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric-driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. Surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Herein, hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (&lt;i&gt;i.&#8201;e&lt;/i&gt;. Cd/Cd(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets) via a facile two-step method. The as-prepared Cd/Cd(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3&#8201;% and the current density achieves 23.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;2.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-saturated 30&#8197;wt% 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)-65&#8197;wt% acetonitrile (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)-5&#8197;wt% water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85&#8201;% at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes.

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of Sulfonylarenes with Alkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to proceed successfully in the presence of a base in MeOH under photoirradiation, giving a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines. The reaction is initiated by photolysis of the S&#8722;Ar bond of sulfonylarenes leading to generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, which get into a radical chain to give &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to be induced by photoirradiation. Here various types of alkylamines, such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines and N&#8208;alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through a homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to the generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals that make a radical chain operative.

Engaging strong electron acceptors in supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor assembly to probe excited electron transfer. Metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination approach has been established to assemble zinc tetrapyrroles with TCBD/DCNQ to witness efficient electron transfer.







Abstract
Using the popular metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination self&#8208;assembly approach, donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates have been constructed using zinc tetrapyrroles (porphyrin (ZnP), phthalocyanine (ZnPc), and naphthalocyanine (ZnNc)) as electron donors and imidazole functionalized tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;TCBD) and cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene&#8208;expanded&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;DCNQ) as electron acceptors. The newly formed donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates were fully characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods, including absorption and emission, electrochemistry, and computational methods. The measured binding constants for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes were in the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Free&#8208;energy calculations and the energy level diagrams revealed the high exergonicity for the excited state electron transfer reactions. However, in the case of the ZnNc:Im&#8208;DCNQ complex, owing to the facile oxidation of ZnNc and facile reduction of Im&#8208;DCNQ, slow electron transfer was witnessed in the dark without the aid of light. Systematic transient pump&#8208;probe studies were performed to secure evidence of excited state charge separation and gather their kinetic parameters. The rate of charge separation was as high as 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 suggesting efficient processes. These findings show that the present self&#8208;assembly approach could be utilized to build donor&#8208;acceptor constructs with powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, to witness ground and excited state charge transfer, fundamental events required in energy harvesting, and building optoelectronic devices.

The synthesis and structure of the first alkaline bismolyl contact ion pair [K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)]+[Bitet]&#8722; and the corresponding yttrium bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)2 are presented. Density Functional Theory calculations of the bismolyl anion revealed that the bismuth atom is in the +1 oxidation state and possesses a dominant mesomeric structure (50&#8201;%) where two lone pairs of electrons reside at the BiI center.

Abstract
The synthesis and first structural characterization of the [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] bismolyl Bitet (C4Me4Bi) contact ion pair (1) is presented. Notably, according to Natural Resonance Theory calculations, the Bitet anion of 1 features two types of leading mesomeric structures with localized anionic charge and two lone pairs of electrons at the BiI center, as well as delocalized anionic charge in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated C4Bi ring. The lone pairs at Bi enable a unique bridging coordination mode of the bismolyl ligand, as shown for the first rare earth metal bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)2 (2). The latter results from the salt metathesis reaction of KBitet with Cptet2Y(BPh4) (Cptet=C5Me4H). The Y&#8208;Bi bonding interaction in 2 of 16.6&#8201;% covalency at yttrium is remarkably large.

Keying Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization of bromofuran with N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, followed by a tandem reaction, concise synthesis of C11&#8208;oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine B was accomplished.







Abstract
Total syntheses of C11&#8208;oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine B, were achieved. The key for the synthesis is a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization of bromofurans with N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, followed by acid&#8208;mediated tandem transformation to construct the tetracyclic skeleton with the C11&#8208;oxygen functional group. Chemo&#8208;selective and catalytic functional group conversions of the tetracyclic intermediate completed the synthesis of fortuneicyclidins and cephalotine B in 8 and 9 steps, respectively.

         <title>Dynamic and Assembly Characteristics of Deep&#8208;Cavity Basket Acting as a Host for Inclusion Complexation of Mitoxantrone in Biotic and Abiotic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;cavity baskets are novel, accessible, modular, and biocompatible hosts. With intriguing conformational dynamics, assembly characteristics and great capacity to bind anticancer drug mitoxantrone, deep&#8208;cavity baskets hold promise for developing antidotes as a countermeasure against a broad range of aromatic toxicants in complex biological systems.







Abstract
We describe the preparation, dynamic, assembly characteristics of vase&#8208;shaped basket 13&#8722; along with its ability to form an inclusion complex with anticancer drug mitoxantrone in abiotic and biotic systems. This novel cavitand has a deep nonpolar pocket consisting of three naphthalimide sides fused to a bicyclic platform at the bottom while carrying polar glycines at the top. The results of 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), 1H&#8197;NMR Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Calorimetry, Hybrid Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD), and Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED) measurements are in line with 1 forming dimer [12]6&#8722;, to be in equilibrium with monomers 1(R)3&#8722; (relaxed) and 1(S)3&#8722; (squeezed). Through simultaneous line&#8208;shape analysis of 1H&#8197;NMR data, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters characterizing these equilibria were quantified. Basket 1(R)3&#8722; includes anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTO2+) in its pocket to give stable binary complex [MTO&#8834;1]&#8722; (Kd=2.1&#8197;&#956;M) that can be precipitated in&#8197;vitro with UV light or pH as stimuli. Both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies showed that the basket is nontoxic, while at a higher proportion with respect to MTO it reduced its cytotoxicity in&#8197;vitro. With well&#8208;characterized internal dynamics and dimerization, the ability to include mitoxantrone, and biocompatibility, the stage is set to develop sequestering agents from deep&#8208;cavity baskets.

         <title>Vanadium(V) Pyridine&#8208;Containing Schiff Base Catecholate Complexes are Lipophilic, Redox&#8208;Active and Selectively Cytotoxic in Glioblastoma (T98G) Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium(V) catecholates are promising agents for intratumoral injections to treat glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. We report a novel promising analog abbreviated [VO(SALIEP)(DTB)] that is highly selective towards glioblastoma cells and nontoxic to normal cells due to the presence of the pyridine ring on the Schiff base. This is the first structure&#8208;activity study to establish this scaffold, which allows high toxicity against glioblastoma (T98G) cells.







Abstract
Two new series of complexes with pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff bases, [VVO(SALIEP)L] and [VVO(Cl&#8208;SALIEP)L] (SALIEP=N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine; Cl&#8208;SALIEP=N&#8208;(5&#8208;chlorosalicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)pyridine, L=catecholato(2&#8722;) ligand) have been synthesized. Characterization by 1H and 51V&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1)&#8197;most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB=3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholato(2&#8722;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2)&#8197;tert&#8208;butyl substituents were necessary to stabilize the reduced VIV species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to VIV occurred for the unsubstituted&#8208;catecholato VV complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [VVO(HSHED)(DTB)]. [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98G (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti&#8208;proliferative activity (IC50 6.7&#177;0.9&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h), which was approximately five times higher than for the non&#8208;cancerous human cell line, HFF&#8208;1 (IC50 34&#177;10&#8197;&#956;M). This made [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injection.

         <dc:description>
In a desert oasis landscape, comprising pyramids of elemental bismuth, the first crystallographically characterized bismolyl ligand as a potassium salt is depicted. Excitingly, two of these anionic ligands bridge two yttrium metallocene cations to give the first rare&#8208;earth bismolyl complex. The lone pairs on bismuth lead to significant Y&#8722;Bi covalent bonding interactions. The yttrium bismolyl complex is redox active, portrayed through the cyclic voltammogram emerging through a sand dune. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Demir and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302687).

         <dc:description>
Through dearomative spirocyclization of a furan and N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with palladium catalysis, concise syntheses of cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine&#8197;B have been accomplished. These natural products have a highly fused polycyclic skeleton including an azaspirocycle. By orchestrating the dearomative azaspirocyclization and a tandem reaction to construct the main skeleton, these natural products can be reached in only eight or nine steps. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Uwabe, K. Muto and J. Yamaguchi (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302769).

         <title>Bioinspired Hydrophobicity for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local CO2 concentration matters for electrochemical CO2 reduction in terms of the activity and selectivity. This review summarizes the bioinspired hydrophobicity design of catalysts and other strategies including catalysts modification, electrolytes selection, and electrolyzers engineering for CO2 enrichment to realize enhanced CO2R performance. This review is expected to provide a guidance for the development of practical electrocatalytic CO2R systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) is a promising pathway for converting greenhouse gasses into valuable fuels and chemicals using intermittent renewable energy. Enormous efforts have been invested in developing and designing CO2R electrocatalysts suitable for industrial applications at accelerated reaction rates. The microenvironment, specifically the local CO2 concentration (local [CO2]) as well as the water and ion transport at the CO2&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;catalyst interface, also significantly impacts the current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and operation stability. In nature, hydrophobic surfaces of aquatic arachnids trap appreciable amounts of gases due to the &#8220;plastron effect&#8221;, which could inspire the reliable design of CO2R catalysts and devices to enrich gaseous CO2. In this review, starting from the wettability modulation, we summarize CO2 enrichment strategies to enhance CO2R. To begin, superwettability systems in nature and their inspiration for concentrating CO2 in CO2R are described and discussed. Moreover, other CO2 enrichment strategies, compatible with the hydrophobicity modulation, are explored from the perspectives of catalysts, electrolytes, and electrolyzers, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CO2 enrichment strategies is provided. We envision that this review could provide new guidance for further developments of CO2R toward practical applications.

         <title>Enhanced Hydroxyl Adsorption in Ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures for Efficient Alkaline Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple topotactic transformation strategy is presented to construct ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures as a desired platform for tailoring the d band centers and further electrocatalytic performance of catalysts. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterointerface is more active toward alkaline methanol oxidation, which may hold great promise in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge transfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#8197;V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.

A direct allylic sulfonylation reaction: Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds.

Abstract
Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism for radical sulfonylation is proposed from the control experiments.

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Furanol&#8208;PAHs via Straightforward Ni&#8208;Catalysed Csp2&#8722;F Functionalization: Mechanistic Insights into the Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization afforded aromatic homologation compounds as valid precursors for nanographene and PAH synthesis through the Scholl reaction. By using low acid/oxidant ratios, an unprecedented furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs are obtained and fully characterized, which sheds light into the intricate mechanism of Scholl reaction. Enantiomeric separation of a racemic curved furanol&#8208;PAH is performed.







Abstract
Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographenes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one&#8208;step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization. The latter are rapidly accessed valid precursors for the Scholl reaction, and screening of experimental conditions allowed us to describe for the first time furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs. Mechanistic insights are obtained by DFT to rationalize the formation of the furanol PAHs under moderately acidic conditions. All PAHs and NGs synthesized show moderate/weak fluorescent properties, and all PAHs crystallized show some degree of curvature and are obtained as racemic mixtures. Enantiomeric separation by chiral HPLC of one furanol&#8208;bearing PAH allowed the study of their chiroptical CD properties.

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of 3&#8208;Substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones via Non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we present an efficient enantioselective amination of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones utilizing non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The process is applicable to various functionalized substrates and it is found to be scalable. Mechanistic investigations based on control experimental and DFT studies suggest that the reaction operates via non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of 2&#8208;benzofuranones with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is reported. The process is based on non&#8208;covalent interaction of NHC with substrate, facilitating the formation of a chiral ion&#8208;pair that encompasses enolate and azolium salt. The activated enolate adds to an electrophilic amine source with sufficient facial control to furnish an enantioenriched product having an amine substituted quaternary stereocenter. The process displays a broad substrate scope. A preparative scale synthesis has been achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations based on experimental and DFT studies suggest a reaction pathway that involves non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions and essentially implicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in diastereomeric transition states for stereo&#8208;chemical discrimination.

         <dc:description>We report the Cu(II) catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from styrene via oxo&#8208;alkylation with unactivated cycloalkanes as the alkylating agent in presence of tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and 1&#8208;methylimidazole as oxidant and base respectively. &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones are known to be synthesized by using either expensive Ru/Ir complexes, or low&#8208;cost metal complexes (e.g., Fe, Mn) with activated species like aldehyde, acid, alcohol, or phthalimide derivatives as the alkylating agent, however, use of unactivated cycloalkanes directly as the alkylating agent remains challenging. A wide range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates as well as various olefinic arenes and heteroarene (35 substrates including 14 new substrates) are well&#8208;tolerated in this method. Hammett analysis shed more light on the substitution effect in the olefinic part on the overall mechanism. Furthermore, the controlled experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, and theoretical calculations (DFT) enable us to gain deeper insight of mechanistic intricacies of this new simple and atom&#8208;economic methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reaction of N&#8208;Carbamoyl Nitrones Generated by N&#8208;Selective Carbamoylation of Oximes with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: N&#8208;Selective carbamoylation reaction of oximes with isocyanates generates nitrones, which undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles to afford diverse isoxazolidines. Notably, combinations of highly electron&#8208;rich oxime and highly electron&#8208;deficient dipolarophile exhibited high reactivity, with product yields of up to 94%. The substituent on the isoxazolidine&#8208;nitrogen atom could be successfully removed without loss of the cyclic structure. Computational studies have also elucidated the mechanism of the reaction and origin of stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethyl group&#160;relishes a privileged position in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into organic molecules often enhances the bioactivity by altering pharmacological profile of molecule. Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls have emerged as pivotal building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry due to their facile accessibility, stability and remarkable versatility. Owing to presence of nucleophilic and electrophilic&#160;sites, they offer multifunctional sites for the reaction. This review covers a meticulous exploration of their multifaceted role, encompassing an in&#8208;depth analysis of mechanism, extensive scope, limitations and wide&#8208;ranging applications in diverse organic synthesis, covering the literature from the 21st century. This comprehensive review encapsulates the applications of trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls and their synthetic equivalents as precursors of complex and diverse heterocyclic scaffolds, fused heterocycles and spirocyclic compounds having medicinal and material importance. Their potent synthetic utility in cyclocondenation reactions with binucleophiles, cycloaddition reactions, C&#8208;C bond formations, asymmetric multicomponent reactions using classical/solvent&#8208;free/catalytic synthesis have been presented. Influence of unsymmetrical trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketones on regioselectivity of transformation is also reviewed. This review will benefit the synthetic and pharmaceutical communities to explore trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls as trifluoromethyl building blocks for fabrication of heterocyclic scaffolds having implementation into drug discovery programs in the imminent future.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Efficient Polymeric Binders for Transition Metal Oxides&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxide cathodes&#160;(TMOCs) such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 have been widely employed in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to superior operating voltages, high reversible capacities and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, despite significant advancements in practical application, TMOC&#8208;based LIBs face great challenges such as transition metal dissolution and volume expansion during cycling, which jeopardizes the future advance of high&#8208;voltage TMOCs. As a critical component of cathode, polymeric binder acts as a crucial part in maintaining the mechanical and ion/electron conductive integrity between active particles, carbon additives, and the aluminum collector, hence minimizing cathode pulverization during battery cycling. Moreover, Polymeric binder with specialized functions is thought to offer a new solution to enhancing the electrochemical stability of the TMOCs. Therefore, this review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>The impact of ortho&#8208;substituents on Bonding in Silver(I) and Halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridines: An In&#8208;depth Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination nature of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen and electron&#8208;donating methyl groups for [N&#8211;X&#8211;N]&#8314; (X =I, Br) complexations have been studied using 15N NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 15N NMR chemical shifts reveal iodine(I) and bromine(I) prefer to form complexes with 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and only 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine. The crystalline halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines were characterized by using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, but 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines were unable to form stable crystalline halogen(I) complexes due to the lower nucleophilicity of the pyridinic nitrogen. In contrast, the halogen(I) complexes of 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine, which has a more basic nitrogen, are characterized by X&#8208;crystallography, which complements the 15N NMR studies. DFT calculations reveal that the bond energies for iodine(I) complexes vary between &#8208;291 and &#8208;351 kJmol&#8208;1 and for bromine between &#8208;370 and &#8208;427 kJmol&#8208;1. The bond energies of halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;halopyridines with more nucleophilic nitrogen are 66 &#8208; 76 kJmol&#8208;1 larger than those of analogous 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines with less nucleophilic nitrogen. The experimental and DFT results show that the electronic influence of ortho&#8208;halogen substituents on pyridinic nitrogen leads to a completely different preference for the coordination bonding of halogen(I) ions, providing new insights into bonding in halogen(I) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8208;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2:1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While smaller polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes TnRn (POSS) are readily accessible or even commercially available, unambiguously authenticated larger systems (n &gt; 12) have barely been reported. Synthesis and isolation procedures are lengthy, and yields are often very low. Herein, we present the surprisingly straightforward and high&#8208;yielding access to the phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative of a so far only postulated second D3h&#8208;symmetric T14 isomer and with that the largest crystallographically characterized POSS cage with organic substituents. Treatment of the commercially available incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxane with catalytic amounts of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid results in high yields of the T14Ph14 framework, which is isolated in crystalline form by a simple work&#8208;up. D3h&#8208;T14Ph14 was analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The relative energies of all four theoretically possible T14Ph14 isomers were determined by optimization of the corresponding structure using DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chromophores with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state are promising for the realization of high performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The rational manipulation of HLCT excited state for efficient emitters remains challenging. Herein, we present three donor&#8210;&#960;&#8210;acceptor (D&#8210;&#960;&#8210;A) molecules (mPAN, mPANPH, and mPNAPH) with phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole (PI) and pyridinyl as donor and &#960;&#8208;bridge respectively. Changes in various kinds of polycyclic aromatic derivative acceptors (anthracene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 1&#8208;phenylnaphthalene) could manipulate the excited states and optoelectronic properties. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S1 state of mPNAPH exhibits HLCT nature while the other two molecules show local excited (LE) state dominated feature. The photophysical properties also demonstrate this characteristic. Therefore, compared with mPAN and mPANPH, mPNAPH has higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) whether in solutions or neat films.&#160;Ultimately, the non&#8208;doped devices based on these emitters show high luminance larger than 35000 cd m&#8208;2, and high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) larger than 5% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the mPNAPH&#8208;based device displays an excellent performance of pure blue emission at 456 nm with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage coordinate of (0.15, 0.16) and EQEmax of 6.13% that benefited from the HLCT state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Powerful P&#8211;N Connection: Preparative Approaches, Reactivity, and Applications of P&#8208;Stereogenic Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For more than five decades, P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal&#8208;based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long&#8208;known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8211;P+&#8211;X&#8208; (X&#160;=&#160;O,&#160;S,&#160;BH3) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom. Over the years, intriguing applications in organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis have been reported for some representatives. Asymmetric reductions of C&#9552;C, C&#9552;N, and C&#9552;O double bonds were feasible with selected P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine oxides in the presence of hydrogen transfer reagents. P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine boranes could be easily deprotected and used as ligands for various transition metals to enable catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins and imines. This review traces the emergence of a synthetically and catalytically powerful functional compound class with phosphorus&#8208;centered chirality in its main lines, starting from classical approaches to modern synthesis methods to current applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and&#160;dark state&#160;EPR properties of PDI&#8722;trityl dyads&#160;and triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8211;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8211;chromophore&#8211;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200 ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2.THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectricity and related properties of nitratecadmate(II) hybrid with metal&#8208;vacancy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All crystals are not ideal, and many of their properties are often determined not by the regular arrangement of atoms, but by the irregular arrangement of crystal defects. Many properties of materials can be controlled effectively by proper use of solid defects. By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure (H2dabco)(NH4)(NO3)3 (dabco = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1) with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6 (2). It exhibits a ferroelectric&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at 261 K. A comparison of the various&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structures indicates that the coordination twist of Cd2+ ion leads to instability of the lattices and excellent ferroelectricity. This finding reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectricity and may start the chemistry of metal&#8208;vacancy coordination compounds. This finding reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an effective means to tune the symmetry and produce ferroelectricity.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing&#160;Sialyl&#8208;glycan on Live Cancer Cells by Tailored Boronopeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronic acid&#8208;containing molecules are substantially popularized in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry due to the broad spectrum of covalent conjugations as well as interaction modules offered by the versatile boron atom. Apparently, the WGA peptide (wheat germ agglutinin, 62&#8208;73), which shows a considerably low binding affinity to sialic acid, turned into a selective and &gt;5 folds potent binder with the aid of a suitable boronic acid probe installed chemoselectively. In silico studies prompted us to install BA probes on the cysteine residue, supposedly located in close proximity to the bound sialic acid. In vitro studies revealed that the tailored boronopeptides show enhanced binding ability due to the synergistic recognition governed by selective non&#8208;covalent interactions and cis&#8208;diol boronic acid conjugation. The intense binding is observed even in 10% serum, thus enabling profiling of sialyl&#8208;glycan on cancer cells, as compared with the widely used lectin, Sambucus nigra. The synergistic binding mode between the best boronopeptide (P3) binder and sialic acid was analyzed via 1H and 11B NMR.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;Containing Cycloparaphenylenes and Their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of donor&#8211;acceptor cycloparaphenylenes by incorporating fluorenone is presented, the process yields a selection of four nanohoops that vary in ring size and acceptor strength. Their donor&#8211;acceptor characters were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies as well as electrochemical and computational studies, and the geometries were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring size. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalization or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8211;acceptor chromophores were obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, which revealed that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8211;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.

         <title>Bromine Substitution Improves the Photothermal Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phototheranostic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine substitution enhances the photothermal properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic molecules; this is the outcome of a combination of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The results demonstrate that bromine substitution is promising for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal agents.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8211;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet clinical requirements. In this work, we developed a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#1013;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two times more heat (&#1013;808&#8197;nm&#215;PCE) than their unsubstituted counterpart. We disclose that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR&#8208;II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine substitution is a promising strategy for developing future high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided PTT agents.

         <title>Application of MXene&#8208;based materials for cathode in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 and become the most promising high energy storage system in the future. However, their applications are hindered by insulated feature and volume expansion of sulfur, as well as the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong ability of polysulfides adsorption. Besides, their unique two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, abundant functional groups and adjustability are beneficial to overcome the drawbacks of sulfur cathode. In this review, different mainstream preparation methods and excellent properties of MXenes are summarized. Important achievements and recent progress of MXene&#8208;based cathodes and interlayers applied to cathodes are concluded later. Finally, there are also provided the difficulties and potential uses of MXenes for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy based on &#8220;Ambident Anthracene&#8221; for the Synthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Iptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes using an "ambident anthracene" building block is presented. For that purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is currently the iptycene with the longest chain to have been synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed interesting structures in which solvent molecules fill the cavities of these iptycenes, thus creating a &#8220;honeycomb&#8221; structure with the solvent molecules arranged in tubular spaces.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Study on the Theranostic Potential of 177Lu&#8208;labeled Biocompatible Covalent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Targeted Radionuclide Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation &#160;for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90 days.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation &#160;for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90 days. The outcome of this work can provide new hints for traditional nanomedicines and promote clinical translation of 177Lu radiolabeled compounds efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Separator Design Strategies to Advance Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte.&#160; Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Carboxyamidation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered O&#8208;Acylhydroxamates through Formation of Fe(III)&#8208;Nitrenoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by either thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration. Under iron&#8208;catalyzed conditions, the carboxyamidation products were generated in high yield from both Z&#8208;alkene and arene&#8208;tethered substrates. DFT calculations indicate that the iron&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation proceeds via a stepwise mechanism involving iron&#8211;imidyl radical cyclization followed by intramolecular acyloxy transfer from the iron center to the alkenyl radical center to furnish the cis&#8208;carboxyamidation product. Upon treatment with 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, the Z&#8208;alkene&#8208;tethered carboxyamidation products underwent selective O&#8594;O acyl migration to generate 2&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;5&#8208;acyl pyrroles. Thermal O&#8594;N acyl migration occurs during carboxyamidation if the Z&#8208;alkene linker contains an alkyl or an aryl substituent at the &#946;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. On the other hand, the arene linker&#8208;containing compounds selectively undergo O&#8594;N acyl migration to generate N&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;acylisoindolinones, and the corresponding O&#8594;O acyl migration forming isoindole derivatives was not observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation by a Multicomponent Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical bioconjugation of proteins has seen tremendous applications in the past decades, with the booming of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and their use in oncology. While genetic engineering has permitted to produce bespoke proteins featuring key (un&#8208;)natural amino acid residues poised for site&#8208;selective modifications, the conjugation of native proteins is riddled with selectivity issues. Chemoselective strategies are plentiful and enable the precise modification of virtually any residue with a reactive side&#8208;chain; site&#8208;selective methods are less common and usually most effective on small and medium&#8208;sized proteins. In this context, we studied the application of the Ugi multicomponent reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of amine and carboxylate groups on proteins, and antibodies in particular. Through an in&#8208;depth mechanistic methodology work supported by peptide mapping studies, we managed to develop a set of conditions allowing the highly selective modification of antibodies bearing N&#8208;terminal glutamate and aspartate residues. We demonstrated that this strategy did not alter their affinity toward their target antigen and produced an antibody&#8208;drug conjugate with subnanomolar potency. Excitingly, we showed that the high site selectivity of our strategy was maintained on other protein formats, especially on anticalins, for which directed mutagenesis helped to highlight the key importance of a single lysine residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with an unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure&#8208;based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;QZVPP//r2SCAN&#8208;3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100 &#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures are formed via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat&#8208;like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten&#8208;membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder&#8208;ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs) have established a strong foothold in the realm of organic electronics. However, their catalytic potential remains largely untapped. In this study, we synthesise and characterise two bench stable B,N&#8208;doped PAH derivatives based on a 1,4&#8208;azaborinine motif. Most importantly, the anthracene derived structure is an efficient catalyst in the reduction of various carbonyls and imines. These results underscore the potential of B,N&#8208;PAHs in catalytic transformations, setting the stage for deeper exploration in this chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic "self&#8208;activated" precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole.

In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic "self-activated" precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N-propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An unexpected [4+3]/[4+1] reaction of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access challenging 5/7/5 tricycles was developed, together with its mechanistic study by using ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Report here is a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [4+3]/[4+1] cycloaddition of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access compounds with angular 5/7/5 tricyclic skeleton found in natural products. The reaction has broad scope and further transformation of the [4+3]/[4+1] cycloadduct was also investigated.

         <title>Control of Relative Positions of Electron&#8208;Donor and Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules in Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Luminescent Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relative&#8208;position control of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules in charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes without changing their molecular structures has been demonstrated. Different relative positions enabled the CT complexes to exhibit different emission wavelengths and different luminescence processes derived from CT interaction in the ground state, an exciplex, and CT interaction with the electron&#8208;acceptor dimer.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer complexes can exhibit various physical properties that depend on the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules and their luminescence properties. However, elucidating the correlation between the relative positions and detailed luminescence processes without changing the molecular structures has not been explored. Herein, we report control of the relative position based on charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between sulfo and amino groups and on alkylamines&#8217; steric factors, and report concomitant modulation of the luminescent properties. Six charge&#8208;transfer complexes were prepared from anthracene&#8208;2,6&#8208;disulfonic acid and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene as electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules, and various alkylamines. Different alkylamines&#8242; steric factors drastically and precisely changed the relative positions of the electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules without changing their molecular structures. Consequently, the six crystals exhibited maximum emission wavelengths from 543 to 624&#8197;nm and different luminescence processes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Supported Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported Ionic Liquid Phase catalysts combine advantages from homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Control of the catalyst position in the IL film will boost their performance. Four ionic liquids are presented with NHC ligands deposited on SBA&#8208;15. Solid&#8208;state NMR and MD simulations yield a full model of the IL self&#8208;assembled monolayer.







Abstract
Separation and reuse of the catalytically active metal complexes are persistent issues in homogeneous catalysis. Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) catalysts, where the catalytic center is dissolved in a thin film of a stable ionic liquid, deposited on a solid support, present a promising alternative. However, the dissolution of the metal center in the film leaves little control over its position and its activity. We present here four novel, task&#8208;specific ionic liquids [FPhnImHR]I (n=1, 2; R=PEG2, C12H25), designed to self&#8208;assemble on a silica surface without any covalent bonding and offering a metal binding site in a controlled distance to the support. Advanced multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic techniques under Magic Angle Spinning, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, allow us to determine their molecular conformation when deposited inside SBA&#8208;15 as a model silica support. We provide here conceptual proof for a rational design of ionic liquids self&#8208;assembling into thin films, opening an avenue for a second, improved generation of SILP catalysts.

We report the oxidative dimerization reaction of siloxydienes derived from simple enones that creates a new gamma&#8208;gamma (&#947;&#8208;&#947;) C&#8722;C bond using catalytic iron and benzoyl peroxide as the terminal oxidant in acetonitrile solvent at ambient temperature. The reaction shows a broad substrate scope including cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes derived from ketones, aldehydes, and esters, which are converted to 1,8&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds under mild catalytic reaction conditions in 19&#8211;89&#8201;% yield across 30 examples. The method is suitable for the coupling of sterically demanding carbon centers, including the formation of vicinal quaternary centers. Conceptually, the dienol ether serves as a precursor to a conjugated radical cation, which undergoes highly site selective &#947;&#8208;dimerization reactions. The &#947;&#8208;&#947; dimerization strategy is applied to the synthesis of a bioactive analogue of honokiol.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Isomeric I&#8208;branched Polylactosamines Using Traceless Blocking Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for the regioselective I&#8208;branching of polylactosamines is described. Enzyme promiscuity is exploited to generate oligosaccharides functionalized with traceless blocking groups. Multiple oligosaccharides are synthesized to demonstrate that the blocking group selectively directs enzymatic I&#8208;branch regioselectivity. This methodology allows the synthesis of polylactosamines of various topologies.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I&#8208;branching enzyme beta&#8208;1,6&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I&#8208;branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I&#8208;branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly&#8208;LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based on the enzymatic assembly of an oligo&#8208;LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I&#8208;branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I&#8208;branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.

Multiple oligosaccharides are synthesized to demonstrate that the blocking group selectively directs enzymatic I-branch regioselectivity. This methodology allows the synthesis of polylactosamines of various topologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6-linked &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I-branching enzyme beta-1,6-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I-branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I-branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly-LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo-enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based on the enzymatic assembly of an oligo-LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyloxycarbonyl &lt;b&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I-branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I-branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexpected Reduction of a Coordinated Diazapyridinophane Ligand Bound to Chromium(III) Ion Leading to Delocalization of the Unpaired Electron across Two Isolated Pyridine Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine moieties, which are electronically isolated from each other by saturated atom chains, can be potentially redox&#8208;active in complexes. Thus, structural and spectroscopic methods in combination with theoretical calculations provide unequivocal evidence that the coordinated tetraazamacrocyclic ligand L&#8208;N4Me2 in the stable neutral bis(acetato)chromium complex indeed contains anionic pyridine radical units coordinated to a chromium(III) ion.







Abstract
In the tetraazamacrocyclic ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane (L&#8208;N4Me2), the two pyridine units are separated from each other by sp3&#8208;hybridized triatomic bridges. Such electronically isolated pyridine moieties are considerably less prone to reductions than di&#8208; or triimines. A detailed structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic investigation of the complexes [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2] and [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2](PF6), in combination with theoretical calculations, reveals that the reduced complex must be described as a chromium(III) ion coordinated to the anionic radical ligand (L&#8208;N4Me2)&#8901;&#8722; rather than a low&#8208;spin chromium(II) ion bound to closed&#8208;shell ligands. Thus, it is, to the best of our knowledge, only the second example of a stable and structurally characterized metal complex containing a reduced isolated pyridine unit. The stability is attributed to the delocalization of the unpaired electron across the two pyridine units, mediated by their interaction to the metal ion.

         <title>Electronic Effects in Phosphino&#8208;Iminophosphorane PdII Complexes upon Varying the N Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The consequences of varying the substituent of the N atom in bidentate (P,PN) ligand was studied experimentally and theoretically within 3 series of palladium(II) complexes featuring also chlorides and/or isocyanides. The alkyl substituted complexes exhibit the higher stability while the H and trimethylsilyl containing counterparts were the most sensitive. For the latter, charge differences within the complexes were shown.







Abstract
Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine&#8208;iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho&#8208;phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. Cis&#8208;dichloride palladium(II) complexes&#8197;1 in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, 1&#8201;a), a phenyl (Ph, 1&#8201;b), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, 1&#8201;c) group or an H atom (1&#8201;d) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8722;Cl bonds was observed in 1. Complexes 1&#8201;a&#8211;d were converted into [Pd(LR)Cl(CNtBu)](OTf)] 2&#8201;a&#8211;d whose isocyanide is located trans to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(LR)(CNtBu)2](OTf)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;d were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than 2, the isopropyl derivative 3&#8201;a being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from 1 to 2) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs. the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;Free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectivity of electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in aqueous media is tuned by varying pH; redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole (ImBenz) catalyst with a NO2 substituent at pH&#8197;7 favors H2O production, and ImBenz without substituent at pH&#8197;13 favors H2O2 production.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n=3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n=2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.

         <title>NDI based C2&#8208;symmetric Chiral Supramolecular Hydrogels Towards Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The goal of the development of C2&#8208;symmetrical conductive supramolecular hydrogels was to attain uniformity and structural stability. The co&#8208;assembly with bipyridine functional group isomers line up within the gel&#8216;s framework and make channels for electron transmission, and improves their conductivity. By combining the advantages of the two design approaches, this synergistic method produces hydrogels with improved mechanical and conductive properties for possible use in a variety of bio&#8208;electronic devices in personalized healthcare and other bio&#8208;engineering areas.







Abstract
To comprehend the significance of improved conductive properties in C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogels, it is vital to investigate how non&#8208;gelating achiral functional group isomers influence the conductivity of such supramolecular hydrogels, whereas understanding the major driving forces behind this regulatory process is first and foremost. Herein, we report a hydrogel system containing tryptophan&#8208;conjugated NDI as the backbone (L/D&#8208;NTrp), enabling effective supramolecular assembly with the bipyridyl functional group isomers. This co&#8208;assembly behavior results in materials with exceptional mechanical properties and high conductivities, surpassing most previously reported C2&#8208;symmetrical hydrogels, as well as the ability to form controlled morphologies. Notably, the co&#8208;hydrogels displayed an eight&#8208;fold increase in mechanical strength, making them more robust and resistant to deformation compared to the original gel. Additionally, all hydrogels exhibited favorable electrical conductivity, with the co&#8208;assembled hydrogels showcasing notable performance, making them a promising candidate for use in electronic devices and sensors. This report lays the foundation for further investigation into the properties and potential applications of L/D&#8208;NTrp compound in the range of fields, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and electronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comprehend the significance of improved conductive properties in C2-symmetric hydrogels, it is vital to investigate how non-gelating achiral functional group isomers influence the conductivity of such supramolecular hydrogels, whereas understanding the major driving forces behind this regulatory process is first and foremost. Herein, we report a hydrogel system containing tryptophan-conjugated NDI as the backbone (L/D-NTrp), enabling effective supramolecular assembly with the bipyridyl functional group isomers. This co-assembly behavior results in materials with exceptional mechanical properties and high conductivities, surpassing most previously reported C2-symmetrical hydrogels, as well as the ability to form controlled morphologies. Notably, the co-hydrogels displayed an eight-fold increase in mechanical strength, making them more robust and resistant to deformation compared to the original gel. Additionally, all hydrogels exhibited favorable electrical conductivity, with the co-assembled hydrogels showcasing notable performance, making them a promising candidate for use in electronic devices and sensors. This report lays the foundation for further investigation into the properties and potential applications of L/D-NTrp compound in the range of fields, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores were prepared and their redox and optical properties studied in comparison to the known extended TTF with an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core. The dications of these compounds were found to be singlet states that may correspond to closed shell quinoid structures or open shell singlet diradical structures &#8208; for the diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene core, these structures are isoenergetic. The various charge states were differentiated by unique UV/Vis/NIR absorptions.







Abstract
In one&#8208;dimensional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings fused together, one key question is whether the structures possess a quinoidal or aromatic diradical character. Here, we generate such PAHs by reversible oxidation of PAH&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs). Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state. The EPR measurements of radical cations showed unique features for each PAH&#8208;TTF. The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from &#960;&#8208;dimers for the large core. The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) xy scans.

         <title>Silicon Chalcogenide Cage Compounds: New Structures Derived from the Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New silicon chalcogenide cage compounds with amino substituents have been derived from reactions of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with the chalcogen transfer agents Me3NO and propylenesulfide and with the chalcogens red selenium and tellurium in one step. This resulted into the first T4 silsesquioxane, defect&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;type clusters with three Si&#8722;Si bonds and a ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane.







Abstract
The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 (2) was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This resulted in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me3NO, a silicon oxide with adamantane&#8208;type cage 3 was isolated that represents the first isolated T4 silsesquioxane. Reactions with propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane&#8208;type cages 4 and 5 with three Si&#8722;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane 6.

         <title>Classical Gold Carbonyl Complexes in Tetrahedral and Trigonal&#8208;Planar Settings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridyl&#8208;borate scorpionates decorated with anionic and fluoro&#8208;alkyl groups serve as ideal ligands to capture gold(I)&#8208;carbon monoxide fragments in trigonal planar and tetrahedral environments that display remarkably low C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, and have significant Au&#8722;CO &#960;&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
A unique four&#8208;coordinate, classical gold(I)&#8208;carbonyl complex with substantial backdonation from gold has been isolated by using a B&#8208;methylated and fluorinated tris(pyridyl)borate chelator. Its lighter silver(I) and copper(I) analogs enabled a study of trends in the coinage&#8208;metal family. The B&#8208;arylated ligand version also afforded a gold&#8211;carbon monoxide complex that displays a notably low C&#8722;O stretch value, but with trigonal planar geometry at the gold. A computational analysis shows that the AuI&#8722;CO bonds of these tris(pyridyl)borate ligand&#8208;supported molecules consist of electrostatic attraction, OC&#8594;Au &#963;&#8208;donation, and very significant Au&#8594;CO &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bonding components. The latter is responsible for the observed C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, which are lower than in free CO.

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Principle Design for Through&#8208;Space Transmission of Unidirectional Rotary Motion by Molecular Photogears
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereochemical approach to transmitting the directional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors through space onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is put forth and successfully tested by means of quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. A key result in the assessment of the approach is that the desired photogearing process is favorable compared to the undesired, free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation process (&#8220;slippage&#8221;) with which it competes.







Abstract
The construction of molecular photogears that can achieve through&#8208;space transmission of the unidirectional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is a formidable challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines. Here, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle design of such photogears that is based on the possibility of using stereogenic substituents to control both the relative stabilities of two helical forms of the photogear and the double&#8208;bond photoisomerization reaction that connects them. The potential of the design was verified by quantum&#8208;chemical modeling through which photogearing was found to be a favorable process compared to free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation (&#8220;slippage&#8221;). Overall, our study unveils a surprisingly simple approach to realizing unidirectional photogearing.

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Aza/Boracyclophanes with a meta and para Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral aza/boracyclophanes that show unique dependence of the racemization energy barriers on macrocyclic conformations with distinct substitution patterns, and the ring constraints also impact as compared with the open&#8208;chain structures.







Abstract
We herein describe the synthesis of a new class of axially chiral aza/boracyclophanes (BDN1, BXN1, BDB1 and BXB1) using binaphthyls as chiral building blocks and the main&#8208;group (B/N) chemistry with tunable electronic effects. All macrocycles substituted with triarylamine donors or triarylborane acceptors are strongly luminescent. These macrocycles showed two distinct meta and para &#960;&#8208;conjugation pathways, leading to the formation of quasi figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and square&#8208;shaped conformations. Interestingly, comparison of such structural models revealed that the former type of macrocycles BXN1 and BXB1 gave higher racemization barriers relative to the other ones. The results reported here may provide a new approach to engineer the optical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles by controlling &#960;&#8208;substitution patterns. The ring constraints induced by macrocyclization were also demonstrated to contribute to the configurational persistence as compared with the open&#8208;chain analogues p&#8208;BTT and m&#8208;BTT.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of &#960;-conjugated chiral aza/boracyclophanes that show unique dependence of the racemization energy barriers on macrocyclic conformations with distinct substitution patterns, and the ring constraints also impact as compared with the open-chain structures.

Etherification in computational chemistry: Mechanistic studies are of paramount importance for the development of catalytic systems. Our study elucidates the CuII&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed etherification of alcohol substrates under the purview of Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;based coupling reactions. DFT calculations characterized the presence of methoxy&#8208;bridged CuII intermediates as the resting state and the transmetalation step as rate&#8208;limiting. The effect of substrate variation was exemplified by using energy span values. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Koley and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302983).

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Complexes of Tc and Re for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their favorable chemical features, Re and Tc complexes have been widely used for the development of new therapeutic agents and imaging probes to solve problems of biomedical relevance. This review provides an update of the most relevant research efforts towards the development of novel cancer theranostic agents using Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds interacting with specific DNA structures. This includes a variety of homometallic complexes, namely those containing M(CO)3 (M = Re, Tc) moieties, that exhibit different modes of interaction with DNA, such as covalent binding, intercalation, groove binding or G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding. Additionally, heterometallic complexes, designed to potentiate synergistic effects of different metal centers to improve DNA&#8208;targeting, cytotoxicity and fluorescence properties, are also reviewed. Particular attention is also given to 99mTc&#8208; and 188Re&#8208;labeled oligonucleotides that have been widely explored to develop imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through the in vivo hybridization with a specific complementary DNA or RNA target sequence to provide useful molecular tools in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the need for further improvement of DNA&#8208;targeted Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds as potential therapeutic and diagnostic agents is highlighted, and future directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tripodal Triazine and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide based Small Molecules as Efficient Photocatalysts for Visible&#8208;light Oxidative Condensation</title>

         <dc:description>Tripodal donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) small molecules&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;consisting of triazine and 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide, without and with a thiophene spacer have been synthesized. Their optical and redox properties were thoroughly investigated along with their utilization as photocatalysts in organic transformations. Compounds&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;showed broad absorption in the range of 290&#8208;480 nm in solutions and 300&#8208;510 nm in thin films. These tripodal molecules displayed wide optical bandgaps of (Egopt) 3.10 eV and 2.64 eV with very deep&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;6.60 eV and &#8211;6.03 eV) and low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.50 eV and &#8722;3.40 eV). Appreciable electron mobilities of 5.24 &#215; 10&#8208;4&#160;cm2/Vs&#160;and 6.14 &#215; 10&#8208;4&#160;cm2/Vs were obtained for compounds&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;respectively by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Metal&#8208;free tripodal molecules&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;showed excellent photocatalytic abilities towards condensation of aromatic aldehydes and&#160;o&#8208;phenylenediamine followed by cyclization under visible light to yield benzimidazole derivatives that are of high medicinal value.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes&#160;and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel&#8217;s and Baird&#8217;s rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the thiophene rings. To reduce T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work; in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring(s); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.</dc:description>

Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described.







Abstract
Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non&#8208;precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields. The hydrogenation proceeds at 100&#8201;&#176;C with catalyst loadings of 0.25&#8211;0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 2.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% base (KOtBu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20&#8197;bar. Mechanistic insight into the catalytic reaction is provided by means of DFT calculations.

         <title>Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flipping disc networks: A discotic star shaped mesogen decorated with three DNA bases thymine reversibly switches between a columnar and an extraordinary bicontinuous cubic network. The double nanosegregated bicontinuous structure is stabilized by self&#8208;association of hydrogen bonding thymines and realize a 3D charge transport. A phase flipping is also discerned by the addition of adenine as complementary base.







Abstract
A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic 
 phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds. This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.

The BZB crystals characterized by extended &#960;&#8208;stacking along [100] demonstrated semiconductor behavior, whereas the BZN, with its zig&#8208;zag crystal packing and limited stacking characteristics, was reckoned as an insulator. The crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Metal in the Biointeraction of Metallacarboranes with C. elegans Embryos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have transitioned from performing chemical scale studies involving the interaction of metallabis(dicarbollides) with biomolecules in a round&#8208;bottom flask, to now conducting in&#8197;vivo experiments using C. elegans. Results suggest metal (Fe or Co) plays a crucial role in C. elegans at the L4 stage and in embryos, and shows a stronger interaction with ferra compared to cobaltabis(dicarbollides).







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ferrabis(dicarbollide), and their halogenated derivatives are the most studied metallacarboranes with great medical potential. These versatile compounds and their iodinated derivatives can be used in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, particle therapy, and bioimaging when isotopes are used. These metallacarboranes have been evaluated in&#8197;vitro and recently in&#8197;vivo with complex animal models. Lately, these studies have been complemented using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nematode largely used in toxicology. When evaluated at the L4 stage, cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;), exhibited a higher mean lethal dose (LD50) than ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722;). In this work, we used the C. elegans embryos since they are a complex biological barrier with concentric layers of polysaccharides and proteins that protect them from the environment. We assessed if the metal atom changes their biointeraction with the C. elegans embryos. First, we assessed the effects on embryo development for metallacarboranes and their di&#8208;iodinated derivatives. We observed changes in color and in their surface structure. An exhaustive physicochemical characterization was performed to understand better this interaction, revealing a stronger interaction of ferrabis(dicarbollide) compounds with C. elegans embryos than the cobaltabis(dicarbollide) molecules. Unveiling the biological interaction of these compounds is of great interest for their future biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;Derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on Non&#8208;Polar ZnO&#8208;Surfaces</title>

PAK(128&#8211;144)&#8208;peptide adsorption revealed high affinity towards etched single&#8208;crystalline ZnO(11
0) surfaces with adhesion forces ranging up to 600&#8197;pN, measured by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy (SMFS). With the application of the Bell&#8208;Evans theory and complementary peptide adsorption studies, we decipher possible adhesion mechanisms to originate from coordination&#8208; and hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO
 surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600&#8197;pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.

         <title>Quo Vadis CO2 Activation: Catalytic Reduction of CO2 to Methanol Using Aluminum and Gallium/Carbon&#8208;based Ambiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric vs. Catalytic: The herein reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles, a new class of hidden frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring an aluminum or gallium fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold, react stoichiometrically with CO2 forming the stable adducts but also act as an efficient catalyst for the reduction of CO2 mediated by HBpin.







Abstract
We report on so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden FLPs&#8221; (FLP: frustrated Lewis pair) consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring a group 13 fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold to form five&#8208;membered ring structures. Although the formation of the Lewis acid/base adducts was observed in the solid state, most of the title compounds readily react with carbon dioxide to provide stable insertion products. Strikingly, 0.3&#8211;3.0&#8197;mol% of the reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methanol with satisfactory high selectivity and yields using pinacol borane as stoichiometric reduction equivalent. Comprehensive computational studies provided valuable mechanistic insights and shed more light on activity differences.

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with Ketone Selectivity by a Cobalt(IV)&#8208;Oxo Embedded in a &#946;&#8208;Barrel Protein</title>

Artificial metalloenzymes based on a cobalt cofactor show higher activity than the free cobalt complex for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous medium. The cobalt cofactor is presumably stabilized by the hydrophobic cleft provided by the protein NB4.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. This work reports the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8722; (X=Cl, Br; Me3TACD=N,N',N''&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal=CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97&#8201;% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.

         <title>Preparation of Carbazoles Involving 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization, Photoredox&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Thermal Cyclization Reactions: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for the preparation of the carbazole moiety are reviewed. These methods describe the formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Photochemical, thermal and electrochemical transformations are described as interesting preparative methodologies.







Abstract
Carbazole is a heterocyclic motif that can be found in a diverse array of natural and unnatural products displaying a wide range of biological and physiological properties. Furthermore, this heterocycle is part of electronic materials like photoconducting polymers and organic optoelectronic materials owing to its excellent photophysical characteristics. Consequently, the development of synthetic strategies for carbazole scaffolds holds potential significance in biological and material fields. In this regard, a variety of preparation methods has been developed to exploit their efficient and distinct formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions and enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Therefore, this review focuses on the synthesis of a set of carbazole derivatives describing a variety of methodologies that involve direct irradiation, photosensitization, photoredox, electrochemical and thermal cyclization reactions.

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green and environmental protection has been of particular concern in modern chemistry research. In this work, we report a visible&#8208;light photocatalytic molecular reactor based on a novel zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) for the aerobic oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide in water. The Zr&#8208;MOF is constructed from perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand and [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters, and features a 3D (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topological structure with triangular channels of ~5 &#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26 &#197; along c&#8208;axis. Interestingly, this Zr&#8208;MOF exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor in water. When it is used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light in water, the Zr&#8208;MOF could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield, selectivity and superior recyclability. Furthermore, the mechanism studies revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#183;&#8208;) are the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique dynamic configuration&#160;of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99:1.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of a Common&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketiminate NacNac Framework via Sequential Lithiation and Small Molecule Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Bisurea&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Tunable Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea&#8208;based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8208;5 monomers in the cross&#8208;section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co&#8208;assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water&#8208;compatibility and no toxicity for different cell&#8208;lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea&#8208;based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2&#160;Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2&#160;to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R = isopropyl &gt; adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS = trimethylsilyl, R = p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Enthalpy Compensation in Solvent Geometry Regulated Supramolecular Polymerization of Luminescent Napthalimide via a Non&#8208;Cooperative, Isodesmic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are an important class of materials with fascinating functions and properties originated from the dynamic behavior and highly ordered molecular organizations. Here, a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor based functionalized luminescent napthalene monoimide (NMI) undergoes J&#8208;type self&#8208;assembly by non&#8208;covalent interactions via a non&#8208;cooperative, isodesmic mechanism to form supramolecular 1D nanowire. The fundamental insights into the thermodynamics regulating the supramolecular polymerization were derived through the fitting of the isodesmic model to variable temperature UV/Vis data in linear (dodecane) and nonlinear hydrocarbon (decalin) based solvents. This shows a significant role of entropy&#8208;enthalpy compensation in solvent geometry&#8208;regulated formation and stabilization of supramolecular polymer. Furthermore, we have quantitively estimated the influence of solvent geometry and found that NMI forms stronger self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous gel in linear hydrocarbon based solvent compared to nonlinear one and thereby substantially increases the degree of polymerization in linear hydrocarbon solvent (dodecane). This is accredited to the effective influence of the linear hydrocarbon solvent molecules in the polymerization process by favourable van der Waals&#160;interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains of the NMI monomers in contrast to unfavourable interaction of nonlinear hydrocarbon solvent due to geometry mismatch.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Membrane Composed of Nickel Diselenide Nanosheets with Carbon Nanotubes for Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries demonstrate enormous energy density are promising forms of energy storage. Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6&#160;catholyte for lithium sulfur battery. The conductive CNTs facilitates fast electronic/ionic transport, while the polarity of NSN as a strong affinity to lithium polysulfides, effectively anchoring them, facilitating the redox conversion of polysulfide species, and effectively diminishing reaction barriers. The cell with NSN@CNTs delivers the first discharge capacity of 1123.8 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;and maintains 786.5 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;after 300 cycles (0.2 C) at the sulfur loading 5.4 mg. Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;even at a high discharge rate of 2 C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33 mAh even at 10.8 mg for duration of 100 cycles. This research indicates the potential application of NSN@CNTs hybrid materials in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles to Azo&#8208;Linked&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source via its C3&#8208;reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor&#8208;mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2H&#8208;indazoles. The azo&#8208;linked&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both inzadole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;centred indazolone radical intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Unusual Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Type Bisindole Alkaloids from Alstonia macrophylla by Building Blocks&#8208;Based Molecular Networking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8722;C, together with their postulated biogenetic precursors, were isolated from the stem barks and leaves of&#160;Alstonia macrophylla via the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Alsmaphyline A represents&#160;a rare ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloid with an S&#8208;shape polycyclic ring system. Alsmaphylines B and C are two novel ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids with N&#8208;1&#8722;C&#8208;21'&#160;linkages, and the former possesses an unconventional stacked conformation due to the presence of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The chemical structures including absolute configurations of alsmaphylines A&#8722;C were established by&#160;comprehensive spectroscopic analyses,&#160;electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, a plausible biosynthetic pathway&#160;of these bisindole alkaloids as well as their ability to promote the protein synthesis on HT22 cells were discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A non&#8208;solvated alkyl&#8208;substituted Al(I) anion dimer was synthesized by a reduction of haloalumane precursor using a mechanochemical method. The crystallographic and theoretical analysis revealed its structure and electronic properties. Experimental XPS analysis of the Al(I) anions with reference compounds revealed the lower Al 2p binding energy corresponds to the lower oxidation state of Al species. It should be emphasized that the experimentally obtained XPS binding energies were reproduced by delta SCF calculations and were linearly correlated with NPA charges and 2p orbital energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Control of Supramolecular Aggregation of Near Infrared Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Fluorophores Confined in Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of the intermolecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules as chromophores is crucial for tuning their physical properties such as light absorption/emission, and energy and charge transfer. Lots of advances have been achieved in control of intermolecular aggregation of organic chromophores in solid states where an indefinitely large number of molecules are involved. However, much less understanding has been gained at a mesoscale of aggregates formed by well&#8208;defined organization of a deterministic number of chromophores, which has been realized in natural photosynthetic systems but still remains rare in manmade materials. Here, we report both the kinetic and the thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a near&#8208;infrared cyanine dye, PPcy, and its derivatives confined in colloidal nanoparticles stabilized by surfactants in aqueous media. Our results demonstrate that both the aggregation number, the aggregation state and the optical properties of the PPcy chromophores are controllable through optimization of the alkyl and polymer chains tethered from PPcy, the effective concentration of the chromophore inside each particle, and the surfactants utilized to stabilize the colloids in water.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Control of the intermolecular aggregation of organic &#960;-conjugated molecules as chromophores is crucial for tuning their physical properties such as light absorption/emission, and energy and charge transfer. Lots of advances have been achieved in control of intermolecular aggregation of organic chromophores in solid states where an indefinitely large number of molecules are involved. However, much less understanding has been gained at a mesoscale of aggregates formed by well-defined organization of a deterministic number of chromophores, which has been realized in natural photosynthetic systems but still remains rare in manmade materials. Here, we report both the kinetic and the thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a near-infrared cyanine dye, PPcy, and its derivatives confined in colloidal nanoparticles stabilized by surfactants in aqueous media. Our results demonstrate that both the aggregation number, the aggregation state and the optical properties of the PPcy chromophores are controllable through optimization of the alkyl and polymer chains tethered from PPcy, the effective concentration of the chromophore inside each particle, and the surfactants utilized to stabilize the colloids in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Using Palladium Catalysts Supported on Phosphine Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilicas (R&#8208;P&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph, tBu), which possess electron&#8208;donating alkyl substituents on the phosphorus atom, were synthesized using bifunctional compounds with alkoxysilyl&#8208; and phosphino groups, bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]phenylphosphine borane (1a) and bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine borane (1b). Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R&#8208;P&#8208;Pd&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph (2a), tBu (3a), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized 2a and 3a were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that 3a bearing more electron&#8208;donating tBu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of 3a was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells over 19%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate HOMO, and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.</dc:description>
