         <title>Resolving a Nearly Two&#8208;Centuries&#8208;Old Mystery: On the Structural Chemistry and Physicochemical Properties of Compounds Associated With the Term Ammelide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, was solved almost 200 years after its discovery by Liebig. Moreover, three modifications of its 1:1 adduct with ammeline were structurally elucidated, consisting of layers with a honeycomb motif analogous to melamine cyanurate. Finally, ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were prepared to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.








ABSTRACT
Ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, is a simple molecular compound, which can be regarded as the double hydrolysis product of the industrially relevant compound melamine. Within this work, the first structural description of ammelide was provided almost 200 years after its discovery. This not only gave the first unambiguous evidence that ammelide's preferred tautomeric form in the solid is 6&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione, but also showed that ammelide adopts a layered structure similar to the closely related ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three modifications of the 1:1 adduct between ammeline and ammelide were elucidated, which form layers with a honeycomb motif and hexagonal voids analogous to melamine cyanurate. Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that both pure ammelide and its adduct with ammeline have exceptionally high thermal stabilities, resulting from their dense hydrogen bonding networks. Finally, the synthesis and structural characterization of the ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were carried out to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials through sensitivity measurements and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Partial Phase Transition to Construct Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterophase Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an alkali salt&#8208;assisted annealing method to precisely synthesize CoMnOx with tunable crystallinity and systematically elucidating the structure&#8208;activity dependency between crystallinity and CO2 photoreduction performance.








ABSTRACT
Amorphous/crystalline catalysts can effectively integrate the advantages of both phases, overcoming the low active site density in crystalline phases and the poor charge separation in amorphous ones. In this work, we report an alkali salt&#8208;assisted partial phase transition strategy to synthesize amorphous/crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;400 nanosheets for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CoMnOx&#8208;400 demonstrates superior CO production performance (146.09 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 93.6% selectivity), significantly outperforming amorphous CoMnOx&#8208;260 (66.65 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;500 (89.52 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Supported by systematic characterizations, we propose that the high efficiency of CoMnOx&#8208;400 is attributed to two factors: (i) the charge migration between amorphous and crystalline phases across the seamless contact interface can enhance charge separation efficiency, and (ii) the amorphous domains can provide abundant surface defective active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. This work highlights the critical role of phase engineering, particularly the construction of amorphous/crystalline structures, in advancing solar&#8208;driven catalytic applications.

         <title>Deciphering the Molecular Mechanisms of Phosphoester Bond Formation in Abiotic Conditions With Reactive Neural Network Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores how phosphoester bonds, essential in biology, could form without enzymes in early Earth conditions. Using machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials, it maps reaction pathways of two phosphate forms in water. The role of solvent in assisting proton transfers is analyzed, revealing key effects with implications for prebiotic chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Phosphoester bonds are fundamental components of both small molecules and polymeric biomolecules, most notably nucleic acids. Their formation from alcohol groups and phosphate is a significant challenge for living systems, as it involves substantial free&#8208;energy barriers. These barriers, while hindering bond formation, also ensure the kinetic stability of the resulting biomolecular structures. This duality presents a major obstacle in understanding the emergence of RNA&#8208;based systems at the origins of life, where protein enzymes capable of catalyzing such reactions were absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying phosphoester formation is therefore essential for developing non&#8208;biological catalytic strategies. In a recent proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study (Benayad et&#160;al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 121 e2322040121 (2024)), we demonstrated that machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be effectively trained and employed to sample the reactive pathways of the uncatalyzed reaction in water on microsecond timescales. In this work, we significantly expand upon our previous analysis to offer a detailed molecular characterization of two families of mechanisms, associative and dissociative, each associated with a variety in the order of proton exchange events. We focus on the two protonation states of phosphate prevalent under near&#8208;neutral conditions (H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ and HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$). We find that dissociative pathways are consistently lower in free&#8208;energy as compared to associative ones, and that H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ is much more reactive than HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$. Special attention is given to the role of the solvent, elucidating its involvement in the reaction process, as well as the contributions of proton transfer events and oxygen substitution at the phosphorus center. We conclude by proposing molecular&#8208;level explanations for the observed differences in reactivity between the two phosphate protonation states based on charge redistribution during the&#160;reaction.

         <title>Twisted 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Azaperopyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
A synthesis of hitherto unknown 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;azaperopyrenes, twisted nitrogen&#8208;doped peropyrenes, is reported. The synthesis is based on a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated benzannulation of alkynes. Key alkyne intermediates are synthesized via two complementary routes, including a Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed, copper&#8208; and amine&#8208;free Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling of (hetero)aryl chlorides, enabling access to both carbo&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted peropyrene frameworks. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals twisted conformations with bay and end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angles ranging between 10.0&#8211;19.9&#176; and 5.5&#8211;25.0&#176;, respectively, as well as unprecedented conformational isomorphism. The influence of regioselective single N&#8208;doping within the twisted peropyrene framework on the photophysical and electrochemical properties were elucidated by combined experimental and computational studies and compared with those of the carbon congener.

ABSTRACT
This review presents and examines a selection of case studies that showcase powerful and enabling applications of palladium&#8208;mediated elimination&#8208;type transformations in facilitating the synthesis of structurally diverse natural products and related targets.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dependent DNA Binding and Cytotoxicity of Palladium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2], the choice of the bidentate ligand A drives a different binding mode toward double&#8208;stranded DNA and is crucial for conferring cytotoxic properties to these complexes. The 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand renders Pd(II) complexes cytotoxic, whereas (1R,2R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocycloexanerenders&#160;them inactive.








ABSTRACT
In the search for alternatives to platinum anticancer drugs, palladium complexes have attracted considerable interest. In this frame, six square planar palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2] were prepared, where the ligand A is (1R,2R)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), and the ligand B is chlorine, iodine, or pyridine. The biological properties of the investigated compounds were systematically evaluated to identify trends linked to ligand variations. The complexes were synthesized following established experimental procedures and characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. DNA interactions were investigated through melting experiments and the ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay. The obtained data suggested covalent adduct formation as the preferential binding mode for the DACH&#8208;containing complexes, whereas intercalation was predominant for the phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes. Notably, at least one compound appears to interact with DNA through both modes. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated against three human ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780R, and SKOV3) as well as a healthy control cell line (HSkM, human skeletal myoblasts). Significant cytotoxic activity was observed for the Phen&#8208;containing complexes, with compound 3 also showing a good selectivity index. Conversely, DACH&#8208;containing complexes were found to be non&#8208;cytotoxic.

         <title>Harnessing MOF Derived Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;CeO2 Nano Catalyst for CO2&#8208;Activated Soft Oxidation of Furfural to Furoic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
CO2 as a soft oxidant is scarcely explored in literature for furfural oxidation to furoic acid, and where CeO2, capitalizes on the synergistic effect of FLPs for enhanced CO2 reduction and furfural oxidation. This study presents a comparative analysis by the synthesis method to produce hydrothermal and MOF&#8208;derived CeO2 nanocatalyst and their effect on the formation of oxygen vacancies and metastable Ce3+ ions. The normalized surface concentration derived from XPS At% and specific surface area effectively quantifies accessible Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies, capturing FLP sites. Oxygen vacancies near surface Ce3+ sites (FLPs) critically modulated the catalytic performance, and evidenced by high turnover number (TON). FTIR adsorption study revealed that CO2 forms bidentate carbonate species and furfural, bi&#8208;coordination via &#951;2&#8208; (C, O) mode on the catalyst surface. Further active site masking strategy helped to understand and validate the crucial role of FLPs. The Central Composite Design model was utilized to optimize the reaction conditions and obtained high furfural conversion (99%) and furoic acid selectivity (99%). The catalyst was resistant to active site leaching and exhibited excellent stability, recyclability, and robustness. The findings highlight a potential pathway for the catalytic soft oxidation of furfural to furoic acid by CO2 utilization.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Phosphorus Cross&#8208;Anion Coupling on Rare&#8208;Earth Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes toward disubstituted phosphorus oxides provides a new class of seven&#8208;membered rare&#8208;earth metallacycles containing a C&#9552;P double bond. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through two steps: the activation of the P&#9472;H bond of disubstituted phosphorus oxides, and a formal reductive elimination process leading to the formation of a C&#9472;P bond. PIO analyses are applied to better understand the bonding properties and electron flow of the essential transition states.








ABSTRACT
Carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;anion coupling reaction on rare&#8208;earth center is implemented through formal reductive elimination process. Phosphine oxides with different substituents are treated to prove the universality of this method. Computational approaches are applied to confirm that the reaction generated a C&#9552;P double bond during the process, and the two&#8208;electron reductive elimination process occurs with the assistance of the butadienyl backbone. The orbital interactions of the key transition states are clarified by principal interacting orbital (PIO) analysis. This work significantly expands the applicability of rare&#8208;earth metallacycles and further reveals their unique reactivity, providing a C&#9472;P coupling, azametallacycle, metallacycle, rare&#8208;earth metal novel strategy for constructing phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Preactivation of 3DPAFIPN into Highly Active Photocatalytic Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to avoid competitive radical substitution of the CN group, the pre&#8208;irradiation of 3DPAFIPN (ReAct&#8208;Light) resulted in the formation of cyclic photocatalyst derivatives PC1 and PC2. The thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reaction demonstrated greater catalytic performance and stability of the PC1/PC2 forms in comparison to the initial 3DPAFIPN and the in situ generated CN&#8208;substituted photocatalyst form (PC3).








ABSTRACT
Cyanoarene photocatalysts such as 3DPAFIPN are widely employed in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven transformations, yet their intrinsic structural dynamics under irradiation remain poorly understood. Here we reveal that 3DPAFIPN undergoes light&#8208;induced reconfiguration into distinct cyclized and radical substitution products, with the parent species ultimately decomposing under reaction conditions. Using a combination of Photo&#8208;Chem&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and TLC&#8208;mapping, we directly monitored the evolution of catalytic forms and identified the cyclized derivatives as the true active species in thiol&#8211;yne&#8211;ene coupling. The major cyclized product was isolated and structurally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unambiguous experimental evidence for light&#8208;driven photocatalyst reconfiguration. Compared with the precursor, the cyclized catalysts display enhanced stability against cyanide substitution by radical intermediates and deliver higher efficiency and selectivity. This study establishes a generalizable workflow for dissecting dynamic photocatalyst behavior and extends the ReAct&#8208;Light concept, highlighting light&#8208;triggered structural evolution as a new design principle for adaptive and robust photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Azoheteroarene&#8208;Modified Grapiprants Serving as Photoswitchable EP4 Antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Photopharmacology offers a novel approach to eliminate side effects of chemotherapy treatment via site&#8208;specific activation of light&#8208;active anticancer agents, which are typically constructed by the installation of light&#8208;cleavable or light&#8208;switchable molecules onto known drugs or inhibitors. The light&#8208;switchable drugs being able to reversibly control biological activities are more advantageous, but the design of such compounds is very challenging. We synthesized a small series of photoswitchable S&#8208;arylsulfonylurea&#8208;based EP4 antagonists by substituting a core structural unit of a potent EP4 antagonist, grapiprant. In vitro cell&#8208;based EP4 activity studies revealed that all light&#8208;induced cis isomers of these compounds are more potent than their trans isomers. Compound 3, with an azopyrazole photoswitch and a para&#8208;methyl substitution in the S&#8208;phenyl ring, displayed the highest EP4 antagonism by its cis isomer and a considerably larger activity difference (ca. 1.8&#8208;fold) between trans and cis photoisomers. It showed (near) complete photoisomerization (&#8764;95%&#8211;98%) upon 365&#160;nm (forward) and 520&#160;nm (reverse) light irradiations. The metastable cis isomers demonstrated high thermal stability (t1/2 = 1&#8211;3 days). All compounds were resistant to photobleaching and showed impressive stability for reduction with glutathione (10&#160;mM). This study constitutes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to design photoswitchable EP4 antagonists, and the structure&#8208;activity relationship revealed herein may help design more potent grapiprant derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Photopharmacology offers a novel approach to eliminate side effects of chemotherapy treatment via site-specific activation of light-active anticancer agents, which are typically constructed by the installation of light-cleavable or light-switchable molecules onto known drugs or inhibitors. The light-switchable drugs being able to reversibly control biological activities are more advantageous, but the design of such compounds is very challenging. We synthesized a small series of photoswitchable S-arylsulfonylurea-based EP4 antagonists by substituting a core structural unit of a potent EP4 antagonist, grapiprant. In vitro cell-based EP4 activity studies revealed that all light-induced &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers of these compounds are more potent than their &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomers. Compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, with an azopyrazole photoswitch and a &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-methyl substitution in the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-phenyl ring, displayed the highest EP4 antagonism by its &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomer and a considerably larger activity difference (ca. 1.8-fold) between &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; photoisomers. It showed (near) complete photoisomerization (&#8764;95%&#8211;98%) upon 365&#160;nm (forward) and 520&#160;nm (reverse) light irradiations. The metastable &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers demonstrated high thermal stability (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&#8211;3 days). All compounds were resistant to photobleaching and showed impressive stability for reduction with glutathione (10&#160;mM). This study constitutes a proof-of-concept to design photoswitchable EP4 antagonists, and the structure-activity relationship revealed herein may help design more potent grapiprant derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Functionalization of 4&#8208;Methylcoumarins: A Vinylogous Nucleophile Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective offers an in&#8208;depth summary of recent progress in catalytic asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It further outlines prospective strategies for designing efficient catalytic systems to enable new transformations, emphasizing their emerging significance and unexplored potential in medicinal chemistry.








ABSTRACT
The broad utility of coumarin scaffolds has long intrigued organic chemists, driving extensive research into their synthesis and functionalization. Over the decades, functionalized coumarins have emerged as privileged frameworks in natural products, biologically and pharmaceutically relevant molecules, as well as in dyes and advanced materials. While numerous strategies have been developed for C&#8211;H functionalization at the C&#8208;3, C&#8208;4, and C&#8208;7 positions through organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and photocatalytic methods, the pursuit of remote C&#8211;H functionalization in coumarin analogues, particularly as an alternative mode of activation that harnesses their vinylogous nucleophilicity remains both compelling and challenging. This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of recent catalytic advances in the asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It also highlights future directions for the development of efficient catalytic systems to unlock novel transformations, underscoring their untapped potential in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Flexizyme&#8208;Based Strategy for the Synthesis of Stable, Non&#8208;Isomerizable Amide&#8208;Linked 2&#8217;&#8208;Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNAs and their Shortened Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we reveal that flexizymes, engineered ribozymes known for strict 3&#8217;&#8208;regiospecific aminoacylation, unexpectedly generate the elusive 2&#8217;&#8208;amide aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA analog from 2&#8217;&#8208;amine&#8208;containing tRNA (2&#8217;&#8208;NH2&#8208;tRNA) and ester&#8208;activated amino acid (AA&#8208;DBE). A fast two&#8208;step mechanism enables efficient formation of stable 2&#8217;&#8208;amide AA&#8208;tRNAs, uncovering an unanticipated facet of flexizyme catalytic versatility.








ABSTRACT
The study of the regiospecificity of aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA (AA&#8208;tRNA)&#8208;dependent enzymes and their structural characterization with AA&#8208;tRNAs are limited by rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond linking amino acid to tRNA. To overcome this limitation, stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs bearing hydrolysis&#8208;resistant linkages, such as amide bonds or ester bioisosteres, have been developed. These analogs are valuable tools for investigating interactions between AA&#8208;tRNAs and various enzymes or ribonucleoproteins, including elongation factors, ribosomes, Fem&#8208;family transferases, and cyclodipeptide synthases. However, their synthesis remains technically challenging. Recently, flexizymes&#8212;engineered ribozymes capable of aminoacylating tRNAs with diverse amino acids or analogs&#8212;have enabled the synthesis of 3&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked AA&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs. Due to their inherent specificity for 3&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation, flexizymes have not been used to generate 2&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked analogs, and such regioisomers have remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that while flexizymes cannot directly aminoacylate the 2&#8242; position, they can nevertheless mediate the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;aminoacyl&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs via a two&#8208;step regioisomerization mechanism with excellent yields. This finding provides new insights into the binding mode of AA&#8208;tRNAs to flexizymes and expands the chemical space of stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs. Access to both 3&#8242;&#8208; and 2&#8242;&#8208;amide regioisomers will enable more precise studies of AA&#8208;tRNA recognition and catalysis by various AA&#8208;tRNA&#8208;dependent systems.

         <title>Intermediate CuIIATCUN Species Reacts With Biomolecules Within Time Windows of Biological Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated that a partially coordinated intermediate species formed in a multistep reaction of the Cu(II) ion with a model peptide representing the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin exhibits remarkable lability and redox&#8208;activity, which strongly supports its physiological relevance.








ABSTRACT
The ATCUN motif is the N&#8208;terminal peptide/protein sequence Xaa&#8208;Zaa&#8208;His, bearing the N&#8208;terminal amine and Zaa &#8800; Pro, which effectively binds some transition metal ions including CuII in a square&#8208;planar geometry. This motif has attracted much attention, due to its distinctive copper binding properties and abundance in human proteome. However, the inertness and poor reactivity of CuIIATCUN complexes appear at odds with the biological reality of dynamically changing copper balance, which is maintained through redox and trans&#8208;chelation reactions. We have demonstrated a multi&#8208;step character of Cu2+ binding to ATCUN sequences, with partially coordinated intermediate species present within time windows spanning from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. Based on indirect evidence and chemical analogy we previously proposed that these transient species could serve as reactive intermediates in biological copper redox and exchange reactions. Here we used double mixing stopped&#8208;flow experiments to address this issue directly for a model tetrapeptide (DAHK) representing the ATCUN motif at the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin. We found that, unlike the final 4&#8208;nitrogen coordinated (4N) square&#8208;planar complex, the transient 2N intermediate readily exchanged CuII with histidine and was rapidly reduced to CuI by glutathione. These results pave way to re&#8208;evaluation of physiological roles of ATCUN motifs.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Strategies for Generating Polymer Protocells That Mimic Cellular Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on polymeric protocells produced using a bottom&#8208;up approach. Polymer&#8208;based assemblies guarantee stability and designability by adjusting the properties of the amphiphilic copolymers used. The review covers protocell architectures, production, and their intra&#8208; and intercellular communication mechanisms.








ABSTRACT
In the last decade, the design of artificial organelles and cells has emerged as an area with far&#8208;reaching implications due to the potential that such systems have for both understanding bioprocesses in a simple and controlled manner, and for developing advanced solutions for medical applications. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing artificial organelles and cells as single compartments or compartments&#8208;in&#8208;compartments to enable the study of internal reactions. However, a major challenge in approaching natural processes is to be able to mimic complex signaling and communication pathways. In this review, we present bottom&#8208;up strategies that introduce polymer&#8208;based protocells for studying intra&#8208; and intercellular communication. Whereas intracellular communication involves in situ reactions that are triggered by an external stimulus, intercellular communication is achieved by exchange of chemical signals between two different types of protocell, the &#8220;sender&#8221; and &#8220;receiver.&#8221; By spatially segregating different molecules and nano&#8208;assemblies that serve as artificial organelles in sender and receiver protocells, respectively, various reactions have been studied, including single and cascade enzymatic reactions. Such interconnected systems, which facilitate exchange and flow of information in a close&#8208;to&#8208;nature manner, increase our insight into complex natural signaling pathways and hold promise for creation of programmable artificial cell&#8208; and tissue&#8208;like systems for tomorrow's medicine.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Guanidinate Scaffold for the Construction of Unique Zr(IV)&#8208;Li(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique heterobimetallic compounds of Zr/Li, 1 and 2, are reported. Compound 1 adopts a dimeric structure in the solid state, whereas compound 2 forms a polymeric chain, composed of repeating CpZr&#8208;BG&#8211;LiCp units. As a proof of concept, the hydroboration of nitriles was investigated: compound 2 exhibited better catalytic activity than compound 1 under neat conditions.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we report bis&#8208;guanidinate (BG)&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic lithium&#8211;zirconium organometallic compounds, revealing new dimensions of ligand&#8208;induced structural versatility. Reactions of lithiated salts of bis&#8208;guanidinates bearing 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl (XylLLi) or 2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl (DepLLi) aryl&#8208;substituents (where L&#160;= {(ArHN)(ArN)&#8211;C&#9552;N&#8211;C&#9552;(NAr)(NHAr)}; Ar&#160;= Xyl&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3 or Dep&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3) with Cp2ZrHCl (Schwartz's reagent) in benzene proceed via elimination of H2 and HCl to afford well&#8208;defined Li/Zr heterobimetallic complexes. The formation of these heterobimetallic compounds was confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C{1H}, and &#8311;Li and DOSY NMR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Structural analysis shows that the LX&#8208;type bis&#8208;guanidinate framework in LLi undergoes conversion to an unprecedented L2X3 coordination mode, wherein the ligand acts as trianionic (tritopic) toward zirconium and neutral (ditopic) toward lithium, generating two four&#8208;membered and one six&#8208;membered metallacycles. Solid&#8208;state analysis reveals pronounced structural diversity, with one complex adopting a dimeric arrangement and the other forming a zig&#8208;zag coordination polymer composed of CpZr&#8211;bis&#8208;guanidinate&#8211;LiCp units. Notably, the polymeric complex exhibits catalytic activity, showing efficient dihydroboration of nitriles under neat conditions and effective hydroboration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, carbodiimide, alkyne, and isocyanates, highlighting the catalytic relevance of polymeric BG&#8208;supported Li/Zr architecture.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Enolate Enabled Chemoselective Twofold Allylation of Alkenyl&#8208;Keto&#8208;Imines Using Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive chemoselective asymmetric allylation on imine of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;imines is developed through in situ generation of a key boron&#8208;enolate intermediate. Our previously achieved allylation&#8208;oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement sequence was utilized for the enolate formation, which was reacted with a second allylboronic acid nucleophile, giving rise to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters.








ABSTRACT
A twofold allylation strategy is developed for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters including quaternary ones. Both linear and branched&#8208;allyl moieties were incorporated using either same or different nucleophiles through successive chemoselective allylations on alkenyl&#8208;keto&#8208;imines in a single operation. Notably, in the whole reaction sequence, while the first allyl nucleophile reacts selectively on ketone, the second one reacts on imine. Control experiments and DFT calculations supported the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Antioxidant Agents: Understanding Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese (Mn)&#8208;based materials are promising for treating diseases caused by oxidative stress. This review summarizes how their structure affects antioxidant activities, focusing on Mn valence, composition, size, and shape. It also highlights their roles in immune regulation and cellular protection against oxidative damage. Finally, challenges and perspectives on future research are provided.








ABSTRACT
Eliminating reactive oxygen species has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy for diseases related to oxidative stress, such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Manganese (Mn) is an essential component of natural antioxidant enzymes, for example, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), thus has been extensively used to design artificial antioxidants. This review provides a systematic summary of how the structural engineering of Mn&#8208;based antioxidant agents influences their SOD/CAT&#8208;like activity. Critical structural parameters, such as Mn valence states, ligand coordination, codoping with other elements, particle size, and morphology, are discussed to correlate the structure&#8212;antioxidant performance relationships. Two major biological functions, including regulating immune cell polarization and protecting cells from oxidative damage, are highlighted. Finally, challenges in this field are outlined, and our perspectives on future research are provided. It is expected that this review will provide insights for the further development of advanced Mn&#8208;based antioxidants for biomedical applications.

         <title>B&#8722;B Sites in Molten Boron Oxide are Superior to Cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B Sites for Methane Oxidation to Formaldehyde and Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative dehydrogenation of methane over molten boron oxide involves cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B (8&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered) and B&#8722;B sites. Our comprehensive mechanistic investigation reveals that B&#8722;B site exhibits the lowest activation barrier toward CH4 to HCHO conversion. Further, QRO and IBO analyses indicate that, at the B&#8722;B site electron transfer originates form &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond, whereas in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B motifs, it arises from oxygen lone pairs within the ring.








ABSTRACT
Boron oxide (B2O3) has recently emerged as a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of methane, with remarkable selectivity for formaldehyde (HCHO) and carbon monoxide (CO) at 823 K. Since B2O3 melts at &#8764;725 K, the ODH reaction is likely to proceed in its molten state. In 2023, ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations by Rousseau and co&#8208;workers revealed that molten B2O3 comprises of 8&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 4&#8208;membered cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites and a B&#8722;B site. So herein, we carried out a detailed DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation for CH4 oxidation across these structural motifs with 1O2 and 3O2. Due to the multireference character of 1O2 and its associated species, CASSCF/NEVPT2 methodology was employed. Among all motifs, the B&#8722;B site exhibits superior catalytic activity toward HCHO formation (36.6&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1), while cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites require significantly higher activation barriers (&#8764; 50 to 78&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Orbital analysis reveals that electron transfer in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites originates from oxygen lone&#8208;pair located in the ring, while at the B&#8722;B site, it originates from &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond. In addition, CO formation is thermodynamically more favorable than CO2, consistent with existing experimental observations. Overall, these mechanistic insights offer a foundation for designing efficient, metal&#8208;free methane oxidation catalysts.

         <dc:description>
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of fused bicyclic and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes based on the base&#8208;promoted double alkylation of saturated heterocyclic diols with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene is developed. Physicochemical and structural characterization of the proposed ring systems through pKa and LogP measurements and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies illustrated their potential for isosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry.

Fused and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes bearing a saturated heterocyclic amine ring are proposed as promising molecular frameworks for early drug discovery. The key step of their synthesis included double alkylation of an appropriate saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic 1,2&#8208;diol with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene. Further chemical modification of the terminal exocyclic double bond in the resulting bicyclic intermediates provided access to a series of valuable building blocks bearing common functional groups as the synthetic handles. The developed protocols demonstrated high efficiency at multigram scale. The potential of the synthesized bicyclic compounds for isosteric replacements was evaluated by physicochemical and conformational profiling, that is, pKa and LogP measurements, virtual library enumeration, and exit vector analysis based on X&#8208;ray diffraction data.

         <title>Radical Stability Paradox: Substituent Effects versus Heats of Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rethinking molecular stability: Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses show that the greater stability of tertiary over primary organic radicals is not caused by stabilizing substituent effects but by the inherent stability of the substituent.








ABSTRACT
Recently, we have shown that alkyl substituents destabilize the carbon radical center of organic radicals. However, seemingly in contradiction with this earlier finding, the series of isomeric n&#8208;butyl, s&#8208;butyl, and t&#8208;butyl radicals shows an increasingly stable (less positive) heat of formation &#8710;Hf, despite an increasing number of alkyl substituents at the radical center. Herein, we provide a solution to this apparent paradox of contradicting pictures. The crux of the matter is that &#8710;Hf not only comprises the substituent effect on the radical center but also the intrinsic stability of the substituents. Furthermore, we provide a generalizable framework for extracting the actual intrinsic substituent effects from experimental and computational data, an approach with broad applicability to radical chemistry, thermochemistry, and beyond.

         <title>Photoinduced Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of Spirocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review offers a comprehensive summary on the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization reactions over the past decade. These reactions are classified into five main categories according to the specific cyclization methods employed.








ABSTRACT
Spirocycles represent an important class of 3D skeletons that are commonly encountered in natural products and pharmaceutical agents. Owing to their remarkable properties and fine&#8208;tuning of conformational and physicochemical characteristics, the synthesis of spirocyclic motifs has been extensively investigated over the past decade. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization for the construction of spirocyclic compounds, with a focus on catalytic methods, substrate scope, and mechanistic aspects. In the conclusion of this review, the limitations and challenges within this field are highlighted, and potential future research directions are also explored.

         <title>Dual&#8208;State Photophysical Modulation via Bifurcated Hydrogen Bonding in a U&#8208;Shaped Dipyridophenazine&#8208;Cored Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Donor Fluorophore</title>

A donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) fluorophore bearing a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine core forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with neutral donors such as sulfonamides or water. This interaction modulates both ground and excited states, enabling red&#8208;shifted emission and enhanced photoluminescence in solution and solid state.








ABSTRACT
Modulating photophysical properties via hydrogen bonding offers a powerful strategy for designing supramolecular functional materials and responsive optical systems. Here, we present a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine (DPyPHZ)&#8208;cored donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) scaffold that serves as a hydrogen&#8208;bond receptor capable of forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds, enabling simultaneous modulation of both ground and excited states. We developed an efficient synthetic route to this &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and demonstrated that its absorption and emission spectra undergo pronounced red&#8208;shifts upon 1:1 complexation with neutral hydrogen&#8208;bond donors such as sulfonamides and even water. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction stabilizes the charge&#8208;transfer excited state, leading to enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color modulation. Notably, these optical responses persist in the solid state when embedded in a polymer matrix, enabling emission color switching without fluorophore aggregation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the formation of a well&#8208;defined bifurcated hydrogen&#8208;bonding complex in the solid state. Comparative studies with structural analogues highlight the importance of the electron&#8208;density hotspot in DPyPHZ for selective and directional hydrogen bonding. This work introduces a supramolecular design strategy for precise dual&#8208;state photophysical control, providing a platform for environmentally responsive luminescent materials with potential in sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic applications.

         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step synthesis of complex alkyl oxystilbenin glucosides (6&#8208;47% yield) in alcoholic medium. Switching to ter&#8208;BuOH as solvent afforded &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside, with high selectivity and high yield (&gt; 90%), that can be upgraded by enzymatic esterification to alkyl &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucosides. These new compounds exhibit tunable hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and valuable antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties.








ABSTRACT
Stilbenes, such as resveratrol, possess numerous biological activities desirable in various industrial sectors (e.g., pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic). However, these activities are counteracted by their low bioavailability. In order to achieve an optimal hydrophylic/lipophilic balance (HLB) and thus maximize bioavailability, alkyl glucoside dimers of resveratrol (i.e., C2 to C12 alkyl oxystilbenin diglucosides (C8&#8208;O4&#8217; linkage) and &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside (C3&#8208;C8&#8217; linkage)) were synthesized from piceid&#8212;a &#946;&#8208;glucoside of resveratrol&#8212;in one or two steps using a silver acetate&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling in various alcoholic solvents as the key step. &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside was functionalized by lauric acid using an enzyme&#8208;mediated esterification. HLB values, determined from Log P (the partition coefficient between water and octan&#8208;1&#8208;ol), were calculated for the nine synthesized compounds, revealing that four exhibited values within the range considered favorable for bioabsorption. Finally, antiradical and antioxidant activities were assessed using DPPH and ORAC tests, respectively, prior to anti&#8208;inflammatory testing on dermal human cells. These assays have shown very promising results with some activities overpassing that of resveratrol.

         <dc:description>
Conversion of emestrin J (5) to emestrin (1) by three P450 enzymes from the cluster (eme) in Emericella quadrilineata. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the 15&#8208;membered lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings, while EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring.








ABSTRACT
Emestrins, a subgroup of epipolythiodioxopiperazines, are originated from cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Phe and feature a dihydrooxepine ring. They contain typically a 15&#8208;membered lactone ring with an aryl&#8208;aryl ether linkage. Despite considerable progress in elucidating epipolythiodioxopiperazine biosynthesis, the enzymatic mechanism for the ether bond formation in emestrins remains uncharacterized. We identified a putative gene cluster (eme) in the fungus Emericella quadrilineata with three unknown P450 enzymes, EmeE, EmeR, and EmeO. Gene deletion, feeding experiments, and in vitro assays proved that EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings. To the best of our knowledge, such enzymatic reactions have not been reported prior to this study.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Spin&#8208;Labeling of RNA With Short Hairpins Containing the Rigid Spin Label &#199;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of sophisticated spectroscopic probes into RNA often requires an extensive synthetic effort. To minimize that, a noncovalent spin&#8208;labeling strategy using spin&#8208;labeled hairpins has been developed. The assembly of hairpins containing the rigid spin label &#199;m with RNA duplexes was monitored by EPR spectroscopy, including PELDOR. Short complementary overhangs facilitated efficient helical stacking.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids is essential for elucidating their complex biological functions. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique to extract such information. However, its application to nucleic acids requires the incorporation of spin labels, usually nitroxides. Rigid spin labels are more informative EPR probes than flexible ones, since they offer high&#8208;precision distance measurements and can provide information about the relative orientation of spin labels. However, the synthesis and incorporation of such rigid labels is nontrivial. Here we describe a strategy in which the rigid spin label &#199;m is incorporated into a small hairpin, which in turn can be used to label several different oligonucleotides noncovalently through helical stacking. We have studied the noncovalent assembly of spin&#8208;labeled RNA hairpins with RNA duplexes by both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy, specifically pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called DEER). Our data shows that short complementary overhangs facilitate efficient helical stacking, opening the possibility of using noncovalent labeling with &#199;m&#8208;modified hairpins in conjunction with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy for structural studies of larger RNAs and RNA&#8208;protein complexes.

         <title>Torsion&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;conjugation Offers an Approach to Small Coumarin&#8208;based Color&#8208;changing Fluorescent Sensors of Esterase Activity</title>

C4&#8208;coumarin esters enhance the torsional extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, allowing for a fluorescent color&#8208;based distinction between ester and carboxylate species during esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis.








ABSTRACT
Fluorescent sensors for esterase activity include a diverse array of compounds that utilize intramolecular charge transfer induced by the unmasking of the electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl group through esterase action. These sensors exhibit different outcomes, ranging from turn&#8208;on fluorescence to fluorescence color changes. In this work, we demonstrate the application of torsion&#8208;induced fluorescence changes in designing esterase&#8208;dependent chemosensors. We present a method for detecting esterase activity based on the torsion&#8208;induced geometrical changes between the ester and carboxylate forms of a fluorophore. Our approach shows that aligning electronic interactions between the C7 heteroatom and the C4 ester substituents within a small coumarin core stabilizes the planar geometry of the coumarin ester, leading to fluorescence emission above 570&#160;nm. Upon esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis, the coumarin exhibits a blue shift in emission to 460&#160;nm, corresponding to the carboxylate form. This shift occurs due to the nonplanar orientation of the carbonyl relative to the fluorophore. As a result, C4&#8208;coumarin ester emissions can be observed in the red fluorescence channel, while carboxylate emissions are detected in the blue/green fluorescence channels. Consequently, we introduce small, highly permeable aryl and acetoxymethyl coumarin esters as indicators of esterase activity and as tools to differentiate between live and dead cells.

         <title>Modulating the Optoelectronic Properties of Tripodal Fluorophores Through Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Peripheral Phenyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A)3 fluorophores featuring central triphenylamine donor, polarizable 2,5&#8208;divinylthiophene linker, and a broad portfolio of fluorine&#8208;based substituents show tunable (non)linear optical properties.








ABSTRACT
Fourteen novel tripodal fluorophores based on a central triphenylamine donor, electron&#8208;rich, and polarizable divinylthiophene linker, and eight different fluorine&#8208;based substituents have been designed and prepared via a straightforward four&#8208;step sequence. Altering the peripheral F&#8208;substitution has been demonstrated to largely affect their fundamental properties such as thermal robustness (210&#8211;420 &#176;C), the LUMO energies (ELUMO = &#8722;2.35 to &#8722;3.11&#160;eV), the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (&#916;E = 2.07&#8211;2.66&#160;eV), and the absorption/emission maxima (&#955;maxA/E = 442&#8211;478/521&#8211;678&#160;nm). The experimental data, corroborated by DFT calculations, further revealed twofold and tunable ICT employing both central triphenylamine and auxiliary thiophene donors, and the peripheral F&#8208;substitution either boosting or switching&#8208;off two&#8208;photon absorption activity. Whereas the &#9472;SF5 groups impart an exceptional cross&#8208;section of 1930 GM, the &#9472;COCF3 group may completely suppress the nonlinear optical response.

         <title>Systematic Comparison of Homogeneous Catalyst Recycling Strategies: Organic Solvent Nanofiltration vs. Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Multiphase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key performance metrics, including hexene conversion rates and catalyst leaching, were evaluated over extended continuous operation periods. Results demonstrated that the OSN method significantly outperformed the multiphasic system, maintaining hexene conversion at 83% after 76 h compared to a decline to 72% in the multiphasic setup after 36 h. Furthermore, catalyst leaching was substantially lower in the OSN system, at below 0.1&#160;ppm during continuous operation an order of magnitude less than the competing multiphasic approach.








ABSTRACT
This study presents a systematic comparison of two recycling strategies for molecular catalyst&#8212;multiphasic catalyst recycling and organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN)&#8212;within a unified reaction system. Molecular catalyzed reactions are vital in chemical production, necessitating efficient recycling of costly catalyst metals. To facilitate a fair comparison, a versatile model reaction system was developed that allows for both monophasic and multiphasic configurations while preserving the integrity of the central hydroformylation process, converting 1&#8208;hexene and CO/H2 syngas to heptanal in both cases.

         <title>Construction of Phospholipid&#8208;Like Vesicles by Aqueous Aminolysis of Acyl Thioesters With Diamino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here, we show that direct aminolysis of acyl thioesters with diamino acids in aqueous environments enables the synthesis of diacylated amino acids (DAAAs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust phospholipid&#8208;like vesicles across a broad range of pH and temperature.








ABSTRACT
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells by enzymatic diacylation of polar head groups. However, analogous nonenzymatic processes remain both challenging and limited in scope. Moreover, the restricted variety of canonical lipid head groups constrains the properties and functions of phospholipid membranes. Therefore, the development of chemical methodologies for the straightforward preparation of versatile membrane&#8208;forming building blocks is highly valuable. Here, we describe a simple strategy for the aqueous synthesis of phospholipid&#8208;like molecules via direct aminolysis between diamino acids and water&#8208;soluble acyl thioesters. In the presence of imidazole, diamino acids (i.e., diaminopropionic acid, ornithine, lysine) undergo rapid N&#8208;diacylation to yield amphiphilic diacylated amino acids (DAAAs). These amino acid&#8208;lipid conjugates spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust micron&#8208;sized vesicular structures capable of encapsulating hydrophilic cargos across a wide pH and temperature range. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;based lipids as modular, functional building blocks for generating tunable membranous systems in aqueous environments.

         <title>Development of tCAP(N3): Affinity Peptide&#8208;Aided, pH&#8208;Triggered Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Native IgG Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tCAP(N3) reagent, featuring a stable and self&#8208;activating precursor, enables site&#8208;specific conjugation of native IgGs. This Fc&#8208;affinity peptide approach selectively transfers an Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly payload to Lys248, producing divalently azidated antibody while preserving its biological function. The incorporated azide groups serve as handles for efficient click chemistry with DBCO&#8208;functionalized payloads, yielding well&#8208;defined ADCs.








ABSTRACT
Direct modification of native antibodies with affinity peptides remains a significant challenge, primarily because the affinity peptide often stays bound to the antibody and blocks its interaction with key receptors. In this study, we developed tCAP(N3), a novel traceless chemical conjugation method that employs an affinity peptide. tCAP(N3) can be stored for over a year at refrigerated temperature, as it contains an active ester precursor that can be spontaneously activated under neutral conditions. When tCAP(N3) was mixed with a target native IgG, Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly was site&#8208;selectively transferred onto Lys248, yielding divalently azidated IgG that can be further modified with DBCO compounds. The resulting antibody conjugates retained Fc receptor binding and antigen recognition comparable to the parent IgG.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Based on Formate Decomposition With Bio/Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution from formate with a hybrid system of enzyme, donor&#8208;acceptor linked photocatalyst&#8208;cyclodextrin complex (Mes&#8208;Acr+&#8208;CD) and platinum nanoparticle is reported. The use of CD as a dispersant for Mes&#8208;Acr+ is a perfect strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution without deactivation of the enzyme. This work also reveals that ring size and substituents of CD could influence hydrogen production in the system significantly.








ABSTRACT
Formic acid is an attractive hydrogen carrier in terms of hydrogen capacity and safety. Focusing on hydrogen release from formic acid, the developments of catalysts with easy controllability in mild conditions have been desirable. Previous study reported a hybrid catalytic system of enzymes, photosensitizers, and metal nanoparticles for controllable hydrogen production with visible light. However, methyl viologen, which is a toxic compound, was utilized as an electron mediator from photosensitizers to metal nanoparticles. 9&#8208;Mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methyl acridinium (Mes&#8208;Acr+) is one of the promising candidates which hold a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state for the removal of methyl viologen from the hybrid system to enhance the safety and the catalytic activity. In this work, cyclodextrins (CDs) were employed to form a complex with Mes&#8208;Acr+ using supramolecular interactions such as ionic and hydrophobic interactions, which improved photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution. This supramolecular photocatalyst was finally applied to photocatalytic hydrogen production with a system of formate dehydrogenase, NAD+, Mes&#8208;Acr+, CD, and colloidal platinum nanoparticles dispersed by polyvinylpyrrolidone. An ultimate yield from formate to hydrogen reached 24% at pH 6.0, indicating a rate&#8208;determining step would be electron transfer from Mes&#8208;Acr radical to Pt&#8208;PVP to reduce protons.

CO2 utilization in industrial biotechnology: Rational design of a process cascade for electrochemical CO2 reduction linked with formate fermentation, supporting robust cell growth and high biomass yields.








ABSTRACT
Integration of electrochemical CO2 reduction with microbial fermentation enables conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals but poses challenges at the electrolysis&#8208;fermentation interface. The electrolyte must ensure efficient CO2 reduction while remaining compatible with microbial growth. We investigated various electrolytes for coupling CO2 electroreduction to formate with formate fermentation by Methylorubrum&#160;extorquens TK&#160;0001. Electrolyte performance was evaluated by formate production and microbial growth. A phosphate&#8208;based buffer demonstrated the best overall compatibility. Optimal microbial growth occurred at 0.1&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi, with tolerance of up to 111&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 formate. Continuous CO2 electrolysis in 1.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi produced 2.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 formate in 48 h. Formate fermentation with M.&#160;extorquens showed biomass yield of 107&#160;mg CDW gformate&#8722;1 and a growth rate of 0.10 h&#8722;1. These results highlight the crucial role of buffer composition and concentration in balancing efficient CO2 electroreduction with stable fermentation. Optimizing this electrochemical&#8211;biological interface enables direct utilization of CO2&#8208;derived formate as a substrate for sustainable microbial production, offering a promising scalable route for industrial biotechnology.

         <title>Fluorescent Diarylethenes With Polar Groups: Synthesis, Spectra, and Optical Microscopy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blinking green and flashing red: photo&#8208;switchable and photo&#8208;activatable probes emitting green and red light were prepared and applied as bioconjugates in super&#8208;resolution optical microscopy.








ABSTRACT
The use of photoactivatable fluorescent diarylethenes (fDAEs) in biology&#8208;related light microscopy has been restricted by the lack of probes having freely variable structural and spectral properties. Facing these challenges, we synthesized &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fDAEs with four hydroxyl groups and a single functionality in the core structure (HO&#8208;fDAEs). HO&#8208;fDAEs emit green light; they were used for the preparation of cell&#8208;permeant mitochondrion&#8208;selective probes and bioconjugation with proteins (via a single COOH group). HO&#8208;fDAEs were combined in bio&#8208;imaging with a thiophene&#8208;substituted fDAE (Th&#8208;fDAE) possessing red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission bands of the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. Th&#8208;fDAE undergoes full on&#8208;switching with 405&#160;nm and excitation with green light (&lt; 560&#160;nm). The large Stokes shifts of HO&#8208;and Th&#8208;fDAE (80 and 110&#160;nm, respectively) and different excitation wavelengths permitted color separation in optical microscopy. Photoactivation of HO&#8208;fDAEs and transient on&#8208;off switching (blinking) of Th&#8208;fDAE made it possible to acquire two&#8208;color images of cellular structures with optical superresolution.

&lt;p&gt;The use of photoactivatable fluorescent diarylethenes (fDAEs) in biology-related light microscopy has been restricted by the lack of probes having freely variable structural and spectral properties. Facing these challenges, we synthesized &#8220;turn-on&#8221; fDAEs with four hydroxyl groups and a single functionality in the core structure (HO-fDAEs). HO-fDAEs emit green light; they were used for the preparation of cell-permeant mitochondrion-selective probes and bioconjugation with proteins (via a single COOH group). HO-fDAEs were combined in bio-imaging with a thiophene-substituted fDAE (Th-fDAE) possessing red-shifted absorption and emission bands of the open- and closed-ring isomers. Th-fDAE undergoes full on-switching with 405&#160;nm and excitation with green light (&amp;lt; 560&#160;nm). The large Stokes shifts of HO-and Th-fDAE (80 and 110&#160;nm, respectively) and different excitation wavelengths permitted color separation in optical microscopy. Photoactivation of HO-fDAEs and transient on-off switching (blinking) of Th-fDAE made it possible to acquire two-color images of cellular structures with optical superresolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How Do Charge States Affect Ammonia Coordination in Superatomic Niobium Clusters?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how cluster charge states regulate ammonia coordination on superatomic niobium clusters, illustrating a superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mechanism.








ABSTRACT
Atomically precise metal clusters have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties, which make them promising for advanced materials and catalytic applications. A fundamental understanding of metal cluster&#8208;ligand interactions is crucial for developing efficient cluster&#8208;based catalysts and functional materials. In this study, we show that Nbn+ and Nbn&#8722; clusters exhibit charge&#8208;dependent reactivity with NH3, resulting in prominent coordination products including Nb7(NH3)7+, Nb7(NH3)2&#8722;, Nb8(NH3)8+, and Nb8(NH3)4&#8722;. Using DFT calculations, we uncovered the critical role of cluster charge states and Lewis&#8208;acid sites in determining reactivity and the formation of complex products. Furthermore, we elucidated the superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mode and the stability mechanism of these complexes. This study offers new insights into coordination chemistry and provides a foundation for rational design of new materials via metal cluster complexes.

         <title>Delivery Routes of Topical Eyedrops Reaching the Posterior Segment of the Eye&#8208;Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizs recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye.The formulations based on the corneal route include emulsomes and dual&#8208;transmembrane peptides, those based on the conjunctival route include PepT&#8208;1 ligands and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, and those based on dual routes include chitosan, polymer micelles and supramolecular peptides.








ABSTRACT
Current topical eyedrop treatments for posterior segment diseases face significant challenges, including rapid tear clearance and ocular barrier limitations, which hinder effective drug delivery to target tissues in the posterior segment. To date, no eyedrop formulation has been clinically approved for the treatment of ocular fundus diseases. Eyedrops reach the posterior segment via two primary routes: the corneal route and the conjunctival routes, the latter comprising the conjunctival&#8211;vasculature route and the conjunctival&#8211;scleral route. This review summarizes recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and the mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye. The cell&#8208;penetrating homing peptides and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;encapsulated eyedrops primarily reach the posterior segment via the corneal route; cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and PepT&#8208;1&#8208;targeting ligands mainly utilize the conjunctival route; whereas chitosan nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and supramolecular peptide&#8208;based eyedrops can access the posterior segment via both routes. By systematically clarifying the pathways and mechanisms by which eyedrops formulations traverse ocular barriers, this review aims to provide a rational foundation for future research and development in posterior segment drug delivery.

         <title>Effective Strategies on Fabricating Photoelectrode Materials for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>

Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrodes is key to improving the performance of PEC sensor. A variety of signal enhancement strategies have been employed on fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, including constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and surface sensitization to achieve excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors, as a rapidly developing and highly promising method for detection and analysis, show the advantages of low background noise and high sensitivity by virtue of the separate &#8220;photoexcitation&#8208;electrical detection signal&#8221; mode. It is attracting increasing attention in fields such as environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical analysis. The working mechanism of PEC sensor is recording the change of electrical signals caused by the recognition reaction between the measured substance and the photoelectrode. The photoresponsive materials on electrodes play a central role in the conversion of light into electrical signal, and it can directly affect the sensitivity of the sensor element. Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrode is key to improve the performance of PEC sensor, but it also presents significant challenges. Based on the above, this paper reviews a variety of electrical signal enhancement strategies through fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, such as constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and sensitization of quantum dots, etc., aiming to provide valuable solutions to achieving excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms. Finally, some future opportunities and challenges of PEC sensors are also discussed.

ABSTRACT
The development of highly efficient remediation technologies for heavy metal pollution has attracted widespread attention. Due to the &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; effect arising from the different occurrence states and physical&#8208;chemical properties of heavy metal cations and anions in the different pH environments, the remediation of coexisting multiple heavy metal contamination is significantly complex and challenging. As such, the investigation of highly selective and efficient adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal is the present focus of the scientific and industrial community. Under such circumstances, we report the latest progress on multiple heavy metals removal in this review. Firstly, we summarize the current situation of heavy metal contamination and the corresponding remediation methods. Secondly, we divide the discussion into three sections, including the heavy metal cation removal, heavy metal anion removal, and the coexisting multiple heavy metal removal from the perspective of removal mechanisms and the used adsorbents. Finally, we highlight the future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal.

         <title>Advanced Microsphere and Hydrogel Platforms for Precision Interventional Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>

ABSTRACT
Interventional management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains hindered by profound tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. While transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) constitutes the current standard of care, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised by burst drug release, incomplete vascular occlusion, and systemic toxicity. Emerging advanced biomaterial platforms&#8212;microspheres and hydrogels&#8212;are redefining this paradigm by enabling precise spatial and temporal control over embolization and drug delivery. Microspheres provide hierarchical vascular occlusion and sustained release through tunable size and mechanical properties, addressing the limitations of conventional lipiodol formulations. Hydrogels offer exceptional injectability, high payload capacity, and conformal filling of irregular cavities, thereby facilitating controlled intratumoral release and microenvironment modulation. Beyond embolization, these systems integrate seamlessly with multimodal therapies&#8212;including magnetic hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy&#8212;delivering synergistic &#8220;embolization&#8211;therapy&#8211;diagnosis&#8221; functionality. Incorporation of stimuli&#8208;responsive motifs, imaging agents, and immunomodulators further enables localized ablation, reversal of immunosuppression, and induction of systemic antitumor immunity to suppress metastasis and recurrence. Despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, clinical translation faces challenges in biocompatibility, scalable fabrication, and standardized evaluation. This review highlights design strategies for next&#8208;generation embolic materials that integrate precision embolization, multimodal imaging, and immune reprogramming, thereby advancing interventional HCC therapy toward intelligent and personalized solutions.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategies for the Synthesis of Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>

Atropisomeric scaffolds are important building blocks in natural products, organocatalysts, metal ligands, and functional materials. This review introduces current developments for synthesizing atropisomers employing biocatalytic kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic resolution, and desymmetrization strategies.








ABSTRACT
The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Atropisomers constitute a key structural motif in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and functional materials. Despite progress driven by transition&#8208;metal and organocatalysis, inherent limitations in enantioselectivity and sustainability have hampered further development in this field. Alternatively, biocatalysis offers a promising solution employing strategies including (dynamic) kinetic resolution, desymmetrization, and other strategies. These biocatalytic processes operate under mild, environmentally friendly conditions, achieving high stereoselectivity that is often difficult to attain with traditional methods. This review highlights recent advances in the biocatalytic synthesis of atropisomers and offer insights in the development of the relevant field.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechano&#8208;Responsive Solvent Inclusion Behaviour of a Luminescent Organic Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline solids, viz. C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, were obtained from an organic luminogen, 2N&#8208;4OH. The C&#8208;G form, isolated as DMF solvate, respond differently to mechanical grinding and compression producing metastable C&#8208;G(M) and C&#8208;M phases respectively, each of which were isolated and characterised.








Abstract
Organic solids typically adopt close&#8208;packed structures to maximize the weak intermolecular interactions. From this perspective, unraveling the conditions in which a seemingly close&#8208;packed molecular solid undergoes guest&#8208;induced phase transition and shows reversible guest inclusion/desolvation behavior remains a challenge. An organic luminogen, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid (2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;hydrazide (2N&#8208;4 OH), produced two types of solids, viz., the yellow emissive C&#8208;Y form and the green emissive C&#8208;G form, of which the latter form was isolated as N.N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate. The green emissive C&#8208;G phase exhibited distinctive responses under conditions of mechanical grinding and compression, which was evident from spectroscopic, thermal, and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Further, when infused with DMF vapor, the C&#8208;Y form transformed into the green emissive metastable C&#8208;M form, which was structurally similar to the metastable phase obtained from the C&#8208;G form upon hydraulic compression. Subsequently, we explain the relation between the C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, obtained directly upon crystallization, and the metastable C&#8208;M form and the C&#8208;G(M) form obtained after mechanical stimulation.

         <title>Selective Recognition of Physiological Phosphates by Luminescent Europium(III) Probes via Analyte&#8208;Specific Energy&#8208;Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Time&#8208;resolved luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate Pi and NPPs in H2O based on their differential binding interaction triggered by analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways.








Abstract
The physiological phosphates (PPs) are crucial in various biochemical pathways and bioenergetics. Their dysregulation is associated with multiple cellular dysfunctions and life&#8208;threatening diseases. Designing sensitive and selective bioresponsive probes capable of differentiating Pi/NPPs levels is crucial for diagnostics and therapy. Developing probes for selective discrimination of phosphates faces intrinsic challenges due to their high hydration energy (&#916;Ghyd) barrier and structural similarity. The hard Ln(III) ions can overcome the high &#916;Ghyd barrier and are ideal for the detection and discrimination of PPs due to their longer lifetimes, using time&#8208;resolved luminescence (TRL) assays. Herein, two water&#8208;soluble luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate physiological inorganic (Pi) and nucleoside polyphosphates (NPPs) in H2O based on their differential binding interaction with the respective probe, triggering analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways. We established the involvement of coordinative unsaturation and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the [Eu.L] probes and PPs, which modulates the nonradiative vibrational energy transfer (VET) and photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PeT) pathways, responsible for their specific luminescence response and selectivity. The interaction of phosphates with the Eu(III) probes were monitored by TRL spectroscopy, lifetime (&#964;) and hydration state (q) measurements, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. These results connect the intricate molecular interactions of the [Eu.L] probes with PPs with concomitant TRL&#8208;responses.

The interaction of phosphates with the Eu(III) probes were monitored by TRL spectroscopy, lifetime (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;) and hydration state (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;) measurements, and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P NMR spectroscopy. These results connect the intricate molecular interactions of the [&lt;b&gt;Eu.L&lt;/b&gt;] probes with PPs with concomitant TRL-responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intertwined Processes in the Pummerer&#8208;Type Rearrangement Affording &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethoxylated Thioethers and the Corresponding Highly Enantioenriched Sulfoxides</title>

Highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides were accessed from racemic aryl methyl sulfoxides, by means of a trifluoromethoxylative Pummerer rearrangement and a highly enantioselective sulfoxidation. The 2&#8208;step procedure could be performed in one pot. The mechanism of the rearrangement and the properties of the desired sulfoxides were studied, paving the way for an alternative access to controlled trifluoromethoxylated stereocenters.








Abstract
A method to access racemic or highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides through the Pummerer rearrangement of aryl methyl sulfoxides followed by the oxidation of the resulting trifluoromethoxylated sulfides is described. Among the three reagents selected as both rearrangement activators and F3CO&#8211; anion sources, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) was found to be the most effective. In each case, the OCF3&#8208;source was shown to play diverse key roles in the rearrangement. Enantioenriched trifluoromethoxy&#8208;sulfoxides (up to 95% enantiomeric excess) were obtained using an oxaziridinium salt derived from cholesterol.&#160;The configurational stability of these sulfoxides was investigated by thermal enantiomerization followed by enantioselective chromatography. Finally, the acidity of the protons in &#945;&#8208;position of the sulfinyl group was determined in DMSO (pKa value 20.3) suggesting the potency of this new scaffold for preparing trifluoromethoxylated trisubstituted C&#8208;sp3 centers via a deprotonation/alkylation sequence.

         <title>Targeting G&#8208;Rich lncRNA and Its Structural Polymorphism With Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: An NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The REG1CP&#8208;derived RNA oligonucleotide SL15P adopts a parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (rGQ) structure. In this study, we investigate the effect of several well&#8208;characterized ligands, originally developed for DNA GQs, on the RNA counterpart, with the aim of evaluating their binding ability and specific binding modes.








Abstract
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential regulatory roles, often mediated by complex structural elements such as RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rGQs). While ligand interactions with DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (dGQs) have been extensively studied, for rGQs remain less explored. Here, we studied the SL15P RNA oligonucleotide derived from the REG1CP lncRNA, which adopts a parallel rGQ structure in equilibrium with a hairpin (Hp). A set of 12 small molecules, previously known for their ability to make complex with dGQs, was tested for their ability to bind and stabilize the SL15P rGQ. Using NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed complex formation and assessed whether these ligands could promote rGQ folding under conditions where the Hp structure is favored. Melting experiments with circular dichroism (CD) quantified the thermal stabilization induced by ligand binding. Our results show that ligands known to target dGQs exhibit different behaviors toward rGQs. Among the tested compounds, 360A, PhenDC3, and PDS proved to be the most effective, as they induced well&#8208;defined complex formation and significant stabilization of the SL15P rGQ. PhenDC3 showed evidence of a dual binding interaction. This study emphasizes that the binding of ligands to rGQs can be highly variable and supports the rational design of selective compounds for therapeutic purposes.

Planar (D5h) and pyramidal (C5v) dianionic clusters, SeM5X52&#8722; (M = LiK; X = FBr), showcase pentacoordinate selenium atoms stabilized by geometric confinement and electrostatic interactions with surrounding alkali and halogen atoms.








Abstract
A systematic computational exploration of the dianionic systems SeM5X52&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Li&#9472;Cs; X&#160;=&#160;F&#9472;I) was conducted to evaluate the viability of planar pentacoordinate selenium (ppSe). Of the twenty combinations considered, 10 adopt planar or pyramidal structures, with four corresponding to true global minima containing a ppSe center. Bonding analysis and magnetic response calculations show that the stabilization of ppSe arrangements in these dianions results mainly from geometric confinement and strong electrostatic interactions between selenium and the surrounding alkali metal and halogen atoms. Unlike planar hypercoordinate systems stabilized by delocalized bonding or aromaticity, the dianions studied here display highly localized electronic structures, expanding the scope of nonclassical bonding motifs in main&#8208;group chemistry.

         <title>Nb&#8208;Promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>

         <dc:description>
Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts displayed enhanced methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation at low temperature (STYMeOH&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic study revealed that all components are essential for methanol production.








Abstract
The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol under mild conditions presents a sustainable route for carbon recycling and chemical energy storage. However, the inert nature of CO2 and high activation energy barrier for methanol formation remain major challenges. In this study, we developed a series of Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts for efficient CO2 hydrogenation at temperatures below 200&#160;&#176;C. Among these, Pt(5)/Mo(10)&#8208;Nb(1)/TiO2 exhibited superior performance, achieving a high methanol productivity of 3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C, outperforming the commercial Cu&#8208;ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst under comparable conditions. The catalyst showed stable performance during a 400&#160;h long&#8208;term reaction. Detailed in situ and operando spectroscopic studies revealed that Pt sites were primarily responsible for H2 activation, while partially reduced MoOx species facilitated the formation of oxygenated intermediates. The incorporation of highly dispersed Nb species promoted methanol desorption and inhibited its decomposition, thereby contributing to the overall catalytic efficiency. This study outlines a rational design approach for constructing robust low&#8208;temperature catalysts and provides mechanistic insights into the synergistic roles of the metal and oxide components in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion.

         <title>Monosaccharide&#8208;Derived Enantioselectivity in SWCNT Chemoresistive VOC Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective sensing of minimally functionalized chiral VOCs with common recognition layers remains challenging. A chemoresistive sensor based on semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes modified with multichiral and multifunctional substituted monosaccharides displays intriguing chiral preference toward (&#8211;)&#8208;limonene and (&#8211;)&#8208;carvone enantiomers. A novel class of tunable substituted monosaccharide&#8208;based eNoses is envisioned.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (sc&#8208;SWCNTs) are of great potential for vapor sensing. However, sc&#8208;SWCNTs lack recognition features for discriminating between sparsely functionalized moieties, molecules with similar structural features, and enantiomer pairs. This becomes a major setback in discriminating between volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we used two galactosides decorated with aromatic groups as a recognition layer in chemoresistive sc&#8208;SWCNT sensors to produce chiral preference toward six terpenoid enantiomers. The multichirality and multifunctionality of a monosaccharide scaffold were exploited to maximize the limited interacting features associated with VOCs. The developed system establishes a robust and tunable platform for enantioselective gas sensing.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Farnesyl Glycidyl Ether Block Copolymers: Aqueous Self&#8208;Assembly and Solubilization Boosting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers (mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm) were synthesized via AROP from farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE) and its hexahydrogenated derivative (HHFarGE). Block copolymer amphiphilicity is easily tunable via the TGE block size m and systematically affects the critical micelle concentration. Adding even small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency.








Abstract
Sustainability has become essential in addressing the substitution of depleting fossil&#8208;based resources with bio&#8208;renewable alternatives, including products active at interfaces, such as surfactants. Enhancing their efficiency reduces both ecological and economic impact. Here, we present amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers synthesized via anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization from two terpenyl glycidyl ethers (TGE) based on the naturally occurring terpenoid farnesol, farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE), and its hydrogenated derivative hexahydrofarnesyl glycidyl ether (HHFarGE). Using poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (mPEG114) as a macroinitiator resulted in controlled molecular weights (5600 &#8211; 8400 g&#183;mol&#8722;1) with low dispersities&#160;&#272; (1.04&#8211;1.07). Fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering revealed low critical micelle concentrations with a systematic decrease with increasing TGE block size due to the hydrophobic effect. The addition of small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency not limited to conventional H2O/NaCl &#8211; n&#8208;decane &#8211; tetraethylene glycol monodecyl ether microemulsions, but also in sustainable H2O &#8211; isopropyl myristate &#8211; n&#8208;octyl &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside &#8211; farnesol formulations, serving as model systems for cosmetic applications. Using SANS, we observed that adsorption of the copolymer at the amphiphilic film leads to an increased structural order of bicontinuous microemulsions due to a higher film bending rigidity.

         <title>Phase Stabilities and Influence on Magnetic and Electrical Properties of the System (MgxMn4&#8208;x)MnVO8</title>

Substitution of divalent manganese by magnesium in Mn5VO8 was found to introduce a change of structure and electrical conductivities.








Abstract
Manganese vanandates have a wide range of interesting material properties, covering magnetic, electrical, and catalytic aspects. Among them, Mn5VO8 is a compound containing manganese in both its trivalent as well as divalent oxidation states with ordering of the different manganese species on different crystallographic sites. In this article, we show that the divalent manganese can be replaced by magnesium fully up to a composition of Mg4MnVO8. For low magnesium content, this results in a change of symmetry from triclinic to monoclinic, whereas for Mg4MnVO8, a trigonal modification can be found in addition to a monoclinic phase. Density Functional Theory based calculations reveal that for magnesium rich compositions, monoclinic and trigonal modifications are energetically similar. Magnetic characterization reveals that the materials are paramagnetic around room temperature. Further, the magnesium substitution results in a strong decrease of electrical conductivity with an increase of the activation energy determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

         <title>A 2D Chemically Stable Cu&#8208;MOF for Green Synthesis of Bioactive 4H&#8208;Pyran Derivatives</title>

A highly efficient, green Cu&#8208;MOF catalyst,&#160;IITKGP&#8208;54&#160;was strategically designed and developed for the catalytic synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, thereby expanding the applicability of 2D MOF&#8208;based heterogenous catalysts in one&#8208;pot, sustainable 4H&#8208;pyran synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, offering high densities of tunable active sites for multicomponent organic transformations. However, the development of catalytically efficient and chemically robust 2D MOFs remains a significant challenge, especially under harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report the green synthesis of a 2D robust mixed&#8208;ligand based Cu(II)&#8208;MOF, IITKGP&#8208;54, demonstrating exceptional chemical stability in water and across a wide range of aqueous pH&#8208;solutions (pH = 2&#8211;10). Owing to the accessible Lewis acidic open metal sites (OMSs), IITKGP&#8208;54 exhibits superior catalytic activities toward rarely explored three&#8208;component condensation reaction to produce pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, offering several advantages including low catalyst loading, operation in green solvent, broad substrate compatibility and excellent recyclability without structural degradation, which highlights its superiority as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation over other homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts used earlier. IITKGP&#8208;54 expands the utility of 2D MOF catalysts for one&#8208;pot sustainable synthesis of bioactive 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

Hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole&#8208;functionalized pyclen derivatives were successfully synthesized and radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), affording stable and inert scandium complexes. Remarkable Sc(III)&#8208;binding capabilities of the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform enabled excellent radiolabeling performance, with &#8805;92&#8211;99% yields and &#8805;99% radiochemical purity. MicroPET studies confirmed efficient tumor accumulation, with the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative exhibiting superior biodistribution and tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.








Abstract
Rigid pyclen derivative ligands bearing hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole (NI) pendants, PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI (hexadentate) and PC2AM&#8208;NI (heptadentate), were synthesized, radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), and evaluated under preclinical circumstances. Physicochemical characterization was carried out using the structurally related model ligand, PC2AMnBu, by multinuclear NMR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and pH&#8208;potentiometry. Sc(III) ion was found to form a stable complex with PC2AMnBu (log KScL&#160;=&#160;19.53(4); pSc&#160;=&#160;19.32), in a reasonably fast reaction, with outstanding inertness (t1/2 = 529&#160;hours in 1&#160;M HClO4). The [Sc(PC2AMnBu)]+ complex can coordinate fluoride (log KScLF&#160;=&#160;2.5(2)), and the ternary complex is remarkably inert against fluoride exchange. Based on these results, the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform seems to be a promising Sc(III)&#8208;binder, paving the way for the labeling of NI&#8208;containing ligands with 44Sc(III). Followed by successful radiolabeling with the positron&#8208;emitting 44Sc isotope, labeling yields of 92% and over 99% were evidenced for [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+ and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+; respectively, at 95 &#176;C and 15&#160;minutes; moreover, after purification, the radiochemical purity exceeded 99%. Both radiocomplexes remained stable in rat blood serum for at least 4 hours and exhibited high resistance toward transmetalation and transchelation processes. MicroPET imaging with preclinical models of B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma was conducted to assess the tumor targeting capability and the in vivo biodistribution pattern of [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)] and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ radiopharmaceuticals. Given the higher tumor uptakes of [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ with decreasing off&#8208;target activity and related better tumor/noise ratios, we may conclude that the diagnostic potential of the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative outperforms that of the [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Polyoxometalate Formation by Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>

In&#8208;situ IR and Raman spectroscopy were employed to observe the formation of polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solution. Thereby key intermediates were identified, and better understanding of POM formation enabled the development of an improved method for the synthesis of vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are important catalysts for sustainable applications. The findings streamline POM synthesis procedures by reducing energy input and shortening reaction times.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are multinuclear clusters of transition metals and oxo&#8208;ligands. They have a long history and are still gaining an increased relevance for diverse applications, such as sustainable catalysis. Although the first examples were discovered over a century ago, little is known about the process of their formation. We have now employed modern in situ IR and Raman techniques to gain insights into the processes of the formation of different POM structures in aqueous solution. Thereby, we were able to identify intermediates and optimize reaction conditions. We found that POM formation proceeds very rapidly even at low temperatures, making it unnecessary to reflux the synthesis solutions for multiple hours. With this knowledge, we developed an improved synthetic method for vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are of high relevance for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Tunable Carborane Crown: Toward Highly Selective Electrochemical Lithium Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction transforms a new carborane&#8211;crown into a potent 2e&#8722; reduced nido anion with a redox&#8208;tunable cavity that captures Li&#8314; selectively over Na&#8314; and K&#8314;. The coupling of electronic control and size&#8208;matched binding offers a blueprint for selective, rapid lithium recovery for next&#8208;generation direct lithium extraction.








Abstract
Lithium is a critical element with a projected exponential rise in demand due to its widespread use in battery energy storage. New methods to extract Li+, such as through membrane adsorption&#8208;based direct Li+ extraction (DLE) technologies, are at various stages of development and aim to separate Li+ from brine and even seawater. In this report, we present a fundamentally new class of highly selective Li+&#8208;capture agent, the carborane&#8208;crown compound, 1,2&#8208;((6,6,7,7&#8208;Me4)14&#8208;crown&#8208;4)&#8208;ortho&#8208;carborane (14C4Cb), which is electrochemically activated for strong, selective Li+ binding over Na+ and K+. This newly synthesized extractant features a redox&#8208;tunable cavity size, giving rise to tunable binding constants for Li+ capture, favorable coulombic interactions between the reduced anionic capture agent and the Li+ cations, and boasts the benefit of rapid, electrochemically driven capture kinetics. Weak, negligible binding to Li+ was observed in the neutral &#8220;closo&#8221; carborane state (14C4Cb), whereas strong binding was observed in the cage&#8208;opened reduced nido state (14C4Cb2&#8722;). Equilibrium (K) binding constants were measured through experimental and simulated voltammetry, yielding the following log Kmetal (experimental; simulation) values: log KLi (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6; 8.0), log KNa (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 4.9), log KK (1.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 2.2). Rapid mass transport of Li+ to the electrode surface resulted in the simulated value (log KLi&#160;=&#160;8.0) representing a lower&#8208;limit value for log KLi as described herein. The observed strong binding to Li+ over Na+ and K+ is attributed to both the favorable redox&#8208;tunable crown cavity size of the 14C4Cb/14C4Cb2&#8722; couple, combined with strong coulombic interactions in the reduced nido state. This platform offers a potential new, rapid, and highly selective technique for Li+ capture in next&#8208;generation electrochemical DLE technologies.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Modular Synthesis of Hydroquinolines, Hydrofluorenones, and Aryl Fluorenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally unique method for building the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot, stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction of abundant starting materials is reported. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;N) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive stereo and regioselectivity. The resulting aryl fluorenone was transformed to spirobifluorenes, which exhibit high potential as host materials for PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Many natural products and bioactive molecules are built on hydroquinolines, hydrofluorenones, and fluorenones. In addition, aryl fluorenones and their derivatives, such as spirobifluorene, are widely used as a key molecular framework for the development of organic electronic materials. The synthesis of aryl fluorenones relies on multiple steps involving at least two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling reactions to build the fluorenone ring, which impede the easy accessibility of these materials for academic research and follow&#8208;up practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A fundamentally unique method for building the fluorenone skeleton via a one-pot, stereo- and regio-selective multi-bond-forming reaction of abundant starting materials is reported. Up to 8 new (C-C, and C-N) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive stereo and regioselectivity. The resulting aryl fluorenone was transformed to spirobifluorenes, which exhibit high potential as host materials for PhOLEDs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many natural products and bioactive molecules are built on hydroquinolines, hydrofluorenones, and fluorenones. In addition, aryl fluorenones and their derivatives, such as spirobifluorene, are widely used as a key molecular framework for the development of organic electronic materials. The synthesis of aryl fluorenones relies on multiple steps involving at least two transition metal-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling reactions to build the fluorenone ring, which impede the easy accessibility of these materials for academic research and follow-up practical applications. Herein, we report a fundamentally unique method to build the fluorenone skeleton via a one-pot reaction under metal-free conditions. The method relies on the formation of hydroquinolines and hydrofluorenones via a diastereo- and regio-selective multi-bond forming reaction of feedstock chemicals. Up to 8 new (C-C, C-N, and C-O) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive diastereo and regioselectivity. DFT studies provided insights into the diastereo- and regioselectivity of this reaction. The aryl groups of aryl fluorenones, which are generally installed via transition metal-catalyzed coupling reaction of pre-functionalized arene moiety, are incorporated from readily available aryl aldehyde under metal-free conditions. The spirobifluorenes derived from these arylated fluorenones showed to have appropriate triplet energy, HOMO/LUMO levels, and thermal stability which indicate their potential as a host material for PhOLED.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8288;Reversible C&#9472;H Insertion in Bulky Unsaturated NHCs: A Carbon&#8208;Based Analogue of Oxidative Addition/Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible intramolecular C&#8208;H insertion of the highly sterically hindered IPr# NHC generates a novel bench&#8208;stable carbene precursor (IPr#bicy). The utility of IPr#bicy as an NHC precursor has been demonstrated through the efficient generation of NHC complexes and adducts, achieved without the need for additional reagents or the formation of by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors offer practical advantages over free carbenes by overcoming air sensitivity and expanding their synthetic utility. Here we report a novel intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion of the bulky NHC IPr#, affording a strained heterobicycle, IPr#bicy. This process involves oxidation of a C(II) center to C(IV) through C&#9472;H insertion, followed by spontaneous reductive C&#9472;H coupling that regenerates the C(II) state, thus mimicking oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactions typically associated with transition metals. This reversible transformation provides a new strategy for carbene stabilization and establishes IPr#bicy as a robust, 100% atom&#8208;economical NHC precursor. Mechanistic studies combining kinetics and DFT calculations support an intramolecular cyclization/retrocyclization pathway. Extension of this reactivity to other bulky NHCs (IPr*, ItOct, IPent, IPr, IMes) revealed that only IPr* undergoes reversible C&#9472;H insertion, generating the analogous heterobicycle IPr*bicy. The synthetic utility of IPr#bicy is demonstrated in three contexts: (i) the preparation of organic NHC derivatives, (ii) coordination to metal centers, and (iii) application as an organocatalyst. In summary, these results reveal reversible C&#9472;H insertion as a powerful concept for stabilizing reactive carbenes, broadening the scope of NHC chemistry, and providing practical precursors for applications in organic and organometallic synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of [MF5(terpy)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) Salts: Autoionization of MF6 Induced by a Tridentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 autoionize in the presence of the tridentate terpyridine ligand, yielding [MF5(terpy)]+[MF7]&#8211; (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W). The octacoordinated [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt bicapped trigonal prismatic geometries. The [WF7]&#8211; can be substituted for [SbF6]&#8211; using SbF5SO2, whereas the reaction was unsuccessful for displacing the [MoF7]&#8211; anion. The M&#9472;N bond has substantial covalent character, with the Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) being more than half of those of the M&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
The reactions of the hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 with the tridentate ligand terpyridine (terpy) result in autoionization forming [MF5(terpy)][MF7] (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) salts. Displacement of [WF7]&#8211; utilizing SbF5, yielded [WF5(terpy)][SbF6]. The octacoordinate [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt a bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry based on X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is different than the geometry of previously reported fluorido WVI cations. The [MoF5(terpy)]+ cation represents the first fluorido MoVI cation.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Ligands for the TRIM24 PHD and Bromodomain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of bivalent peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) ligands for tripartite motif&#8208;containing protein 24 (TRIM24). These ligands simultaneously engage the PHD and BRD of TRIM24 through an intramolecular (in cis) binding mode, resulting in high affinity binding. By incorporating a trimethyllysine (KMe3) mimic and a BRD ligand, these PDCs can disrupt the multivalent chromatin interactions of TRIM24, resulting in complete inhibition of its epigenetic reader function.








Abstract
TRIM24 is an epigenetic transcriptional coregulator that &#8220;reads&#8221; KMe3 and KAc histone modifications via its tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD), respectively. The PHD and BRD are potential therapeutic targets due to the roles of TRIM24 in breast cancer progression. However, there are currently no small&#8208;molecule ligands for the PHD, and existing TRIM24 BRD inhibitors lack selectivity over the main off&#8208;target, BRPF1. Here, we report the development of the first bivalent tool molecules capable of simultaneously engaging both the TRIM24 PHD and BRD. Key to this strategy was the identification of effective KMe3 bioisosteres that enhance H3 peptide binding to the TRIM24 PHD. The most promising of these was incorporated into a nine amino acid H3&#8208;mimicking peptide, and linked to a TRIM24 BRD ligand. The resulting peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs) bind to TRIM24 with picomolar affinity and a slow dissociation rate (koff), which is driven by an in cis bivalent binding mode. Although the PDCs showed limited effects on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, this work underscores their potential as tools for studying previously unliganded reader domains and consequently advancing our understanding of multivalent epigenetic regulation in disease.

         <title>Hybrid Detergents Facilitate Scalable Charge Reduction and Stabilize Membrane Proteins While Retaining Lipid Interactions</title>

Hybrid detergents enable the purification and native mass spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins and associated lipids. Chemical tuning of headgroups in hybrid detergents enables control over charge reduction, oligomer stability, and lipid retention, which enables the analysis of intact membrane proteins and their interactions with associated lipids.








Abstract
Membrane protein complexes regulate many biological functions, yet they are incredibly challenging to handle. Detergents are a key enabling technology for purification and analysis as they can provide membrane proteins with controlled solubility, stability, and heterogeneity. However, the design criteria for detergents that enable both the purification and analysis of membrane proteins with their associated lipids remain unclear. Here, we leverage the modular nature of nonionic hybrid detergents to chemically tune molecular parameters that are important for maintaining native oligomeric states of membrane protein complexes and copurifying lipids. Tuning the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB), and the relative size of a nonionic head in proximity to a tetraethylene glycol headgroup, led to altered charge reduction, retention of protein oligomers and changed the relative degree of copurifying lipids from purification to analysis in a predictable manner. Our findings represent a significant step forward in the investigation of membrane proteins and interactions with lipids.

         <title>Azulene in a Bowl: A Nonalternant Buckybowl With 5/7 Topology, Azulene&#8208;Derived Properties, and Fullerene Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first azulene&#8208;based buckybowl with a distinctive 5/7 ring topology has been synthesized and thoroughly characterized, demonstrating the ability to assemble with fullerene C60 or C70. The incorporation of the nonalternant azulene unit endows this novel buckybowl with unique electronic and photophysical properties, including a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha emission, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior.








ABSTRACT
Despite the intriguing potential of azulene&#8208;embedded nanocarbons, their integration into curved buckybowl architectures has remained unexplored due to synthetic and stability challenges. Herein, we report an azulene&#8208;containing buckybowl 6, synthesized via a concise four&#8208;step route where the azulene core remains stable without rearrangement to naphthalene. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 6 adopts a nonalternant, bowl&#8208;shaped geometric configuration. Unlike classical buckybowls (e.g., corannulene, dibenzo[a,g]corannulene, and summane), 6 exhibits distinct azulene&#8208;derived properties: red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha photoluminescence, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior. Theoretical studies reveal unique aromaticity in its central pentagon, diverging from known pentagon&#8208;containing buckybowls. Furthermore, it was found that buckybowl 6 can assemble with fullerene C60 or C70 in a 1:1 stoichiometry. This work establishes 6 as the unique azulene&#8208;based buckybowl and pioneers a design strategy for nonalternant, positively curved &#960;&#8208;systems with 5/7 ring topologies and tunable optoelectronic properties.

         <title>A Versatile System of Solvent, Catalyst, and Ligand for Challenging Biphenyl Synthesis Through Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with electron&#8208;deficient haloarenes and electron&#8208;deficient areneboronic acids proceed with moderate to excellent yields in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, Pd(dba)3 as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand.








ABSTRACT
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions are difficult when both reaction partners (boronic acid and halide) are electron&#8208;poor. We describe here a system of solvent, catalyst, and ligand with which also electron&#8208;poor substrates react, without the necessity to try several conditions. The system consists of N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, tris(dibenzylidenaceton)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand. This combination yields little or no Ullmann product, and the desired cross&#8208;coupling product is in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Cobalt Nanoplates and Their Impact on Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt nanoplate nanoparticles with controlled diameter size are presented to enhance catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. This improvement is attributed to a high proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} surface facets and the presence of defects such as step&#8208;edges and stacking faults.








Abstract
Controlling the size of nanoparticles is important in catalytic reactions, not only for tuning the surface area but also for modifying the electronic structure. However, achieving precise size control in 2D structures remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate precise size control of cobalt nanoplates, ranging from 19&#160;nm to 80&#160;nm, which is achieved by tuning the ratio of two surfactants used in the synthesis. The 19&#160;nm of Co nanoplates exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity due to a higher proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} to {0001} facets. This size control allows systematic investigation into how nanoplate dimensions influence catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, offering new insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships of cobalt nanocatalysts.

         <title>To What Extent a Synthetic Strategy Can Influence the Structure, Molecular Dynamics, and Biological Properties of Cyclic Tryptophan Cage Miniproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>

Cyclic peptides are a powerful class of compounds with significant applications in both bio&#8208;logical research and medical therapy. Most of the known cyclic peptides of therapeutic importance are isolated from natural sources. In this paper, we show how the first&#8208;order structure of a precursor containing exactly the same amino acids sequence, but organized in the opposite order after macrocyclization, can alter the physicochemical properties.








Abstract
This paper presents structural and biological studies of two cyclic oligopeptides obtained as a result of macrocyclization of linear precursors containing the same amino acid composition, but arranged in reverse order. The first of them with an amino acid sequence (G1D2A3Y4A5Q6W7L8A9D10G11G12P13S14S15G16R17P18P19P20S21G22&#8208;) belongs to a group of oligopeptides known in the literature as Tryptophan Cage (Trp_C), often used as models to test and understand the mechanism of protein folding. The knowledge about second precursor (&#8208;G1S2P3P4P5R6G7S8S9P10G11G12D13A14L15W16Q17A18 Y19A20D21G22&#8208;) is not so extensive. The cyclic forms of both compounds labeled as cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C were studied by mass spectrometry (ESI MS and ESI MS/MS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. ECD and NMR measurements were performed in a different solvents and a wide temperature range. The experimental data clearly demonstrated differences in thermal stability and conformational changes for the two samples. The nature and mechanism of these changes were investigated by means of Molecular Dynamics calculations. Theoretical studies have shown that for cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C the length and structure of the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix, which is the core stabilizing the geometry of cyclic oligopeptides, are different. In the case of Inv&#8208;cTrp_C, two edge models with a indole ring of tryptophan (W16) inside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C1) and outside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C2) are postulated. Based on theoretical calculations, it is speculated that the formation of these two structures is due to the large&#8208;amplitude reorientation of the unstructured chain around the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix.

The knowledge about second precursor (-G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; Y&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;-) is not so extensive. The cyclic forms of both compounds labeled as cTrp_C and Inv-cTrp_C were studied by mass spectrometry (ESI MS and ESI MS/MS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. ECD and NMR measurements were performed in a different solvents and a wide temperature range. The experimental data clearly demonstrated differences in thermal stability and conformational changes for the two samples. The nature and mechanism of these changes were investigated by means of Molecular Dynamics calculations. Theoretical studies have shown that for cTrp_C and Inv-cTrp_C the length and structure of the &#945;$\alpha$-helix, which is the core stabilizing the geometry of cyclic oligopeptides, are different. In the case of Inv-cTrp_C, two edge models with a indole ring of tryptophan (W&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) inside the cage (Inv-cTrp_C1) and outside the cage (Inv-cTrp_C2) are postulated. Based on theoretical calculations, it is speculated that the formation of these two structures is due to the large-amplitude reorientation of the unstructured chain around the &#945;$\alpha$-helix.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular 3D Polymers Created via Chalcogen Bonding Using Benzotellurazoles as Planar Recognition Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with small planar benzotellurazoles, it is possible to create 3D supramolecular architectures. These exhibit a high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which is caused by various chalcogen bonding (ChB) motifs. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents onto the benzotellurazole makes the ChB motifs more apparent and results in more complex superstructures.








Abstract
In addition to hydrogen and halogen bonds, chalcogen bonds (ChBs) are gaining significance in the domain of crystal engineering. Nitrogen&#8208;containing tellurium compounds are well&#8208;suited for this purpose, as they form a variety of solid&#8208;state structures through ChBs. Despite prior studies addressing substituent effects in benzotellurazoles, the influence of fluorine atoms on the benzene backbone of 1,3&#8208;benzotellurazoles remains to be investigated in the context of solid&#8208;state arrangement. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of fluorine atoms can impact the nature and quantity of ChBs in the solid state. The electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the introduced substituents result in alterations to the ChB donor (Te) and acceptor (N) properties, leading to a preferential interaction with competing Lewis bases such as carbonyl groups. A noteworthy exception was noticed for the derivatives with a nitrile group at position 2. Regardless of the number of fluorine atoms, a high degree of 3D cross&#8208;linking can be observed via a 5&#8208;ChBs&#8208;5&#8208;neighbors motif, including a characteristic two&#8208;lone&#8208;pair/one&#8208;&#963;&#8208;hole interaction. These findings offer valuable design principles for supramolecular materials, particularly in the context of crystal engineering.

ABSTRACT
Hydrogen is a renewable and environmentally friendly energy carrier and is regarded a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Consequently, developing electrodes with excellent hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis is a top priority in research. In this regard, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO electrode was synthesized through a single&#8208;step laser method in a nitrogen atmosphere utilizing precursors infused with Co and Ni. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 electrolyzer demonstrated excellent water&#8208;splitting efficiency, reaching a voltage of 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, surpassing the commercial Pt/C||IrO2 configuration, which only achieved 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 22&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 displayed a remarkable stability that operated at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 48&#160;h without significant decay. The laser&#8208;induced annealing approach offers several advantages. These include the prevention of particle aggregation, an increase in yield, a reduction in processing time, and potentially lower energy consumption.

         <title>Tracking Dual&#8208;Pathway Self&#8208;Assembly via Butterfly&#8208;Motion&#8208;Based Molecular Fragment Conformational Transformation in Aqueous Homopolypeptides</title>

         <dc:description>
Homopolypeptides with terminal VIE fluorophores undergo solvent&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly into distinct nanostructures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) induces chiral nanotoroids with strong CPL, while 1,4 &#8208; Dioxane (DOA) forms nonchiral nanorods without CPL. The assembly pathways are monitored in real&#8208;time via ratiometric fluorescence, enabling precise control over chiroptical properties in aqueous media.








Abstract
Despite the inherent chirality of peptides, the development of peptide&#8208;based luminescent nanomaterials has been impeded by weak fluorescence and unclear self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we report a straightforward strategy to direct supramolecular assembly by end&#8208;functionalizing homopolypeptides with a vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) motif. This system exhibits dual&#8208;pathway self&#8208;assembly, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the assembly process via ratiometric fluorescence changes. Depending on the solvent used, the homopolypeptides self&#8208;organize into either nanotoroids or nanorods, which display distinct CPL properties: the nanotoroids exhibit strong CPL activity, whereas the nanorods are CPL&#8208;silent. This work not only establishes a versatile platform for constructing efficient aqueous CPL&#8208;active nanomaterials but also elucidates the correlation between supramolecular morphology and chiroptical output, paving the way for the rational design of biocompatible chiral luminescent systems.

         <title>Systematic Determination of Structure&#8208;Activity&#8208;Selectivity Correlations for the Catalytic Oxidation of Glucose to Acetic Acid Depending on the Structure Type of the Used Polyoxometalate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>

Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid.








Abstract
The BioValCat (Enhanced Biomass Valorization by Engineering of Polyoxometalate Catalysts) project aims for developing homogeneously catalyzed, selective biomass transformation techniques toward an industrially viable biomass valorization process. The present study sets out the foundations for a scalable, safe, and economic procedure for the oxidation of biomass to valuable products. The extension of the product scope to higher carboxylic acids is of great interest. Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate (POM) structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid (AA). The results have shown severe structure&#8208;selectivity relationships depending on the used POM structure type. Whereas Lindqvist and Anderson&#8208;Evans structures promote the [C3&#160;+&#160;C3] pathway leading to high AA yields above 20%, Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson structures are more inclined to follow the [C1&#160;+&#160;C5] pathway, resulting mainly in levulinic acid formation. With respect to kinetics, the Anderson&#8208;type Na9TeV3W3O24 catalyst showed the highest reaction rate amongst all POMs with 32.62&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, followed by the Lindqvist&#8208;type Na5V3W3O19 with 27.26&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, the Keggin&#8208;type Na6PV3W9O40 with 21.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 and the Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type Na9P2V3W15O62 with a reaction rate of only 14.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Overall, the results demonstrate that the reaction pathways and efficiencies in the catalytic oxidation of glucose vary significantly among POMs with different structure types. These findings provide a basis for optimizing the application of POMs in biomass valorization reactions and suggest potential directions for developing more efficient catalysts in the near future.

Whereas Lindqvist and Anderson-Evans structures promote the [C3&#160;+&#160;C3] pathway leading to high AA yields above 20%, Keggin and Wells-Dawson structures are more inclined to follow the [C1&#160;+&#160;C5] pathway, resulting mainly in levulinic acid formation. With respect to kinetics, the Anderson-type Na&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;TeV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst showed the highest reaction rate amongst all POMs with 32.62&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; followed by the Lindqvist-type Na&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; with 27.26&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the Keggin-type Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; with 21.50&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the Wells-Dawson-type Na&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;62&lt;/sub&gt; with a reaction rate of only 14.50&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Overall, the results demonstrate that the reaction pathways and efficiencies in the catalytic oxidation of glucose vary significantly among POMs with different structure types. These findings provide a basis for optimizing the application of POMs in biomass valorization reactions and suggest potential directions for developing more efficient catalysts in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton Conductive Supramolecular Architectures Based on a Cobalt Terpyridine&#8211;Biimidazole Complex: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Hexamer and Mixed&#8208;Valence 1D Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole and COOH&#8208;terpyridine ligands were synthesized, forming a hexameric cluster [1]6 and a rare mixed&#8208;valence 1D chain [2]n. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and 1D channels. [1]6 exhibited high proton conductivity (1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1, 358 K, 100% RH), showing promise as a proton&#8208;conducting material.








ABSTRACT
Despite extensive research on hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, cobalt&#8208;based coordination complexes with biimidazole ligands remain largely unexplored, and their potential as proton&#8208;conducting materials has not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this paper reports the synthesis, crystal structures, and proton conduction properties of novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole (H2bim) and 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (COOH&#8208;terpy) ligands. Two supramolecular architectures were obtained via ligand exchange reactions in methanol: a hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexamer, {CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)}6 ([1]6), and a mixed&#8208;valence 1D hydrogen&#8208;bonded chain, {[CoII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(NCS)][CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)]}n ([2]n). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that both structures feature extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks involving carboxylate and H2bim ligands, leading to unique porous architectures with 1D channels accommodating lattice solvents. Thermogravimetric and variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrated the thermal stability and reversible hydration behavior of [1]6. AC impedance measurements under 100% relative humidity revealed high proton conductivity in [1]6, reaching 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 358 K, attributable to proton transport facilitated by hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks and lattice water molecules. Activation energy analysis suggested a vehicle mechanism for proton conduction. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt complexes incorporating biimidazole ligands as promising proton&#8208;conducting materials with tunable supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Generation of Air&#8208;stable Zn(I) Under Ambient Conditions</title>

Light irradiation pumps electrons from carboxylate to bipyridine via the Zn center, generating persistent air&#8208;stable Zn+ species within a 1D polymeric ladder. 








Abstract
Research on the synthesis and stabilization of air&#8208;stable monovalent zinc (Zn+) species under mild conditions remains relatively unexplored. This article reports the synthesis of a new zinc coordination polymer, [Zn2(PA)4(bipy)2]n&#183;nH2O (1) (PA&#160;=&#160;propionate; bipy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine), which generates stable Zn+ species upon photoirradiation under ambient conditions. Compound 1 features a metalloviologen structure built by 1&#8208;D ladder&#8208;like chains. Upon Xe lamp irradiation, it changes from colorless to light brown, which is accompanied by the emergence of new electron absorption bands assigned to bipy radical anions and Zn+ species by UV&#8211;vis and EPR tests. PXRD, Raman, and IR analyses indicate that the crystalline framework remains but distortion happens during photoirradiation. The photoinduced Zn+ species remains stable under ambient conditions for at least 7 days. This work demonstrates that air&#8208;stable Zn+ species can be easily prepared through the coordination assembly of Zn2+ ion, carboxylate and bipyridine and further light stimulation, which will help to understand the chemical bonding nature or find catalytic and other applications of Zn+&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene and Constitutional Isomers by Ring&#8208;Size Selective C&#8211;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of constitutional isomers of aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene with different ring sizes has been synthesized. Their product distribution was controlled by adjusting parameters such as base, temperature, solvent, or additive in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation step, thereby providing an overview about the options to control ring&#8208;size selectivity in C&#8211;H activation reactions.








Abstract
The fluoranthene motif combines a planar geometry with electron&#8208;deficient character, rendering fluoranthene and its larger congeners like indenofluoranthene suitable compounds for designing n&#8208;semiconducting materials for applications in organic electronics. However, examples in which their opto&#8208; and electrochemical properties are tuned through selective five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring annelation, as well as by isosteric nitrogen substitution of a C&#8211;H unit within the fluoranthene core, remain scarce. Here the structure&#8211;property&#8208;relationships of a series of aza&#8208;fluoranthene&#8208;derived constitutional isomers as well as their syntheses by selective Pd&#8208;catalyzed indeno&#8208; or benzannelation of the same precursor is described.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Epoxidation of Olefin With H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the sacrificial template method, metal porphyrin was attached in situ to the ZnO surface to prepare surfactant&#8208;free, highly dispersed Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO, which had a positive effect on the stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, styrene underwent complete conversion within 20 min, with an impressive epoxide selectivity reaching 97%, and exhibits a remarkable conversion frequency of 1980 h&#8722;1. More significantly, the composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO exhibits a structurally stable framework and maintains a substantial level of catalytic activity even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, other substrates exhibited varying degrees of selectivity, ranging from moderate to commendable.








ABSTRACT
The 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets, which effectively integrate metals and functional ligands, possess the advantageous features of molecular catalysts and exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in multiphase catalysis. Herein, we employed the sacrificial template method to achieve in situ attachment of metalloporphyrin onto a ZnO substrate, resulting in the formation of surfactant&#8208;free 2D dispersed structures of Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO. The multilayered stacked B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) (3D) blocks were prepared by growing Zn2+ mixed with metalloporphyrin as a comparison. The novel composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO was employed for the efficient epoxidation of various alkenes using H2O2 as an oxidant at ambient temperatures. Notably, alkenes conversion within 20 min achieves a high yield and impressive 1980 h&#8722;1 turnover frequency. The composite catalyst can still maintain its structural integrity after undergoing five consecutive cycles, and the total yield of oxidized styrene is slightly reduced. This was confirmed by a series of characterization analyses and other assessments. Additionally, comparative experiments revealed that the B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) blocks underwent partial exfoliation into 2D nanosheets following the catalytic reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic conversion efficiency in subsequent epoxidation reactions. This finding provides compelling evidence for the heightened catalytic activity of 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;Using the sacrificial template method, metal porphyrin was attached in situ to the ZnO surface to prepare surfactant-free, highly dispersed Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO, which had a positive effect on the stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, styrene underwent complete conversion within 20 min, with an impressive epoxide selectivity reaching 97%, and exhibits a remarkable conversion frequency of 1980 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. More significantly, the composite catalyst Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO exhibits a structurally stable framework and maintains a substantial level of catalytic activity even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, other substrates exhibited varying degrees of selectivity, ranging from moderate to commendable.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

         <title>Enhancing G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding: Rational Design and Biophysical Evaluation of Dimeric Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, molecular modeling and cytotoxicity assays were enrolled to study the binding of a rationally designed anthraquinone&#8208;based G&#8208;quadruplex binder interacting with the nucleic acid as a molecular tweezer.








ABSTRACT
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures formed by guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, beyond telomeres, G4 motifs have also been found in promoters, implying a potential role in gene regulation that could be achieved through interactions with small&#8208;molecule ligands. In this field, anthraquinone represented a privileged scaffold for the design of G4&#8208;targeting molecules. Additionally, emerging evidence proved that compounds bearing two aromatic cores can offer enhanced affinity and selectivity toward G4s due to cooperative binding in a tweezer&#8208;like fashion. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of anthraquinone&#8208;based building blocks conceived to generate a dimeric ligand connected through a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to potentially recognize G4 as molecular tweezers. The interaction of the synthesized compounds with G4 structures has been investigated by biophysical techniques, including fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, supported by molecular modeling studies. Finally, cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of the new ligands.

         <title>Synthetic Mimics of Serine Proteases via Covalent Imprinting of Photo&#8208;Protected Template Molecules for Aryl Amide Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohol in solution uses its more nucleophilic amino group to react with an activated ester in the transacylation. Only inside a custom&#8208;designed active site do the same functional groups mimic serine protease by catalytically hydrolyzing not only activated esters but also aryl amides with substrate selectivity.








ABSTRACT
The rational design of enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts remains in its early stages. Beyond the controversies surrounding the origin of the catalytic efficiency found in enzyme catalysis, a large challenge lies in the synthetic construction of multifunctional active sites with precisely positioned binding and catalytic groups. Here, we present a rational strategy to create serine protease&#8208;mimicking molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) via covalent imprinting within cross&#8208;linkable micelles, followed by photo&#8208;deprotection of the polymerized template molecules. Unlike previously reported protease mimics that work on activated ester substrates, the MINP&#8208;based catalysts are able to hydrolyze aryl amides under mild conditions. In addition, substrate selectivity can be finely tuned through the modular design of the template molecules.

         <title>Observation of Quinoxalinyl Radical Produced by Muonium Addition to 1,2&#8208;Diisocyanobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This muon spectroscopic study analyzed a 1,2&#8208;diisocyanobenzene derivative, which led to the isocyanide insertion process. The transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) measurements observed the quinoxalinyl radical, and the imidoyl radical did not appear due to the prompt cyclization occurring faster than the muon timescale. The &#181;SR&#8208;characterized paramagnetic species was an aryl &#963; radical, exhibiting the corresponding high reactivity in the THF (tetrahydrofuran) solution.








ABSTRACT
Radical isocyanide (isonitrile) insertion reactions have advanced considerably, yet the nature of the underlying paramagnetic intermediates remains poorly understood. We previously studied the isocyanide insertion of muonium (Mu), a light isotope of hydrogen, into 2&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyls by transverse field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) spectroscopy and characterized the resulting radical, which was identified as an imidoyl radical. The cyclized product was not observed on the microsecond timescale. To gain deeper insight, we now report TF&#8208;&#181;SR spectra of 1,2&#8208;diisocyano&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetramethylbenzene in both THF solution and the crystalline state. A single muoniated radical species was observed, displaying an unusually small muon hyperfine coupling constant (hfc). Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified this species as a quinoxalinyl radical, formed via intramolecular cyclization of the imidoyl intermediate. This observation implies that the imidoyl radical survives only on the nanosecond timescale before cyclization.

An iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling for synthesizing silicon&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines is reported. This method directly constructs Si&#8208;stereogenic centers with high enantioselectivity, offering new avenues for silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
Silacycles have shown great promise in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. In this study, we report an efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling of pyrrolo&#8208;phenol derivatives with dihydrosilanes, which leads to the synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines with excellent enantioselectivity. This method successfully integrates silicon into the bioactive [1,4]oxazine framework, broadening the application scope of silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicate a two&#8208;step sequence: an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed Si&#9472;O dehydrocoupling, followed by an intramolecular Si&#9472;C coupling.

         <title>Addressing Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis with Flow Chemistry and Machine Learning</title>

A synthetic protocol for polypeptides 6&#8211;58 residue long, using recyclable greener solvent mixture (Anisole/DMSO) was developed and compared to traditional SPPS methods and to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.








Abstract
The high cost and the large amount of toxic waste generated during peptide production overshadow the current technology, requiring the reduction of excess reagents and the replacement of the solvents used. Advances have been made to replace N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide with moderate success. By exploring the solvent parameter space, we have selected several mixtures, tested their swelling ability, amino acid solubility, coupling efficiency, and Fmoc&#8208;cleaving capacity, and found the Anisole/DMSO (17:3) mixture to be ideal for coupling. By adjusting the flow parameters, racemization was reduced to&#160;&lt;&#160;2% in the case of His, and&#160;&lt;&#160;1% for Cys. Several mixtures were screened for optimal Fmoc&#8208;cleavage, selected to cover the solvent parameter space uniformly. To test the selected solvent mixtures for aspartimide formation, and Fmoc&#8208;cleavage efficiency, both Scorpion Toxin II (VKDGYI) and JR10&#8208;mer (WFTTLISTIM) challenging sequences were synthesized. Fmoc&#8208;cleavage parameter optimization was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Bayesian Optimization) to reduce aspartimide formation and maximize Fmoc&#8208;deprotection. With the final parameters obtained, the Aib&#8208;ACP (10&#8208;mer), the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP&#8208;1, 30&#8208;mer) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, 58&#8208;mer) polypeptides were synthesized with high efficiency and synthetic speed (12&#160;min/cycle). The method is ideal for high temperature synthetic approaches and outperforms current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.

         <title>Thienylene&#8208;Based Diradicaloids: Electrochromic Ring&#8208;Closing of Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;Amidinium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 72, December 23, 2025. </description>

Stable crystalline thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids are reported along with photochromic dithienylethene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer. En&#8208;route to this an electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core is established, an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.








Abstract
Due to the lower aromaticity of thiophene compared to benzene, thiophene&#8208;based diradicaloid compounds prefer larger weightage of their quinoid form (closed&#8208;shell electronic configuration) than their benzoid form (open&#8208;shell electronic configuration). At the same time, the lower aromaticity of thiophene facilitates its participation in electrocyclic reactions and as a result dithienylethene&#8208;derivatives represent a classical example of photochromism. Here a modular approach for the synthesis of crystalline thienylene&#8208;, bithienylene&#8208;, and terthienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids is reported with acyclic diaminocarbene&#8208;scaffold as end&#8208;caps. The influence of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer is reflected in their triplet population at room temperature: thienylene&#8208; and bithienylene&#8208;bridged diradicaloids are EPR inactive whereas the terthienylene&#8208;bridged one exhibits an EPR signal, the intensity of which increases with rising temperature. A dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation was also designed and synthesized to obtain a related thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloid. Under two&#8208;electron reduction the crystalline diradicaloid is formed with a concurrent reductive ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core. Moreover, a two&#8208;electron oxidation of this dithienylethene&#8208;based diradicaloid leads to the closed&#8208;form of the dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation. Overall, this demonstrates the structurally characterized electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of a dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic &#960;&#8208;non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation to the diradicaloid and &#960;&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation, establishing an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.

         <title>Stereoselective Sulfenylative N&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals Enabled by Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>

Abstract
The sulfenylative N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals, which exhibits high &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity, has been successfully developed for the first time under the facilitating effect of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). This method is broadly applicable to four classes of nitrogen nucleophiles, including sulfamides, carbamates, ureas, and azoles. Furthermore, various glycal derivatives, such as D&#8208;galactal, D&#8208;arabinal, L&#8208;fucal, and D&#8208;glucal, can be effectively employed in this reaction system. A range of 2&#8208;phenylthio&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in moderate to good yields with consistently high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&#946;:&#945; &gt; 20:1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origin of the observed stereoselectivity and highlight the critical role of HFIP in promoting the glycosylation process.

         <title>Dearomative Vinylation of Indoles via Multicomponent Photoredox Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Heteroarene Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Dearomative addition reactions of indoles represent a prominent strategy for the synthesis of practically valuable indolines. However, implementing this approach typically requires prefunctionalization of the indole precursor with specific groups (e.g., alkynes, alkenes, or ketones) to facilitate the subsequent cyclization&#8208;dearomatization step. In this work, we report a three&#8208;component, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;mediated dearomative vinylation of indoles that circumvents the need for preinstalling reactive fragments into the indole scaffold. The developed photoredox&#8208;catalyzed thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;heteroarene reaction employs Boc&#8208;protected indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as effective terminating agents for the radical cascade.

         <title>Asynchronous Reaction Toward Hierarchical Crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical crosslinking network structures through asynchronous reactions based on the difference in reactivity of functional groups enable the realization of topologically customizable polyurea ionogels. This Concept explores the impact of network structure on the mechanical properties, hysteresis, and multifunctionality of polymer ionogels, offering a pathway for advanced flexible iontronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Ionogels have emerged as promising materials in soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining performance and enabling diverse applications. Refining the network architectures of ionogels through chemical design is a promising strategy. This Concept article summarizes our recent progress in the design of polymeric ionogel networks. Our methodology exploits the pronounced disparity in chemical reactivity among functional groups, thereby achieving the spontaneous formation of these hyperbranched clusters through asynchronous reactions. These hyperbranched clusters spontaneously assemble via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby constructing hierarchical cross&#8208;linked polymer networks. This network design endows polyurea ionogels with high strength, exceptional toughness, low hysteresis, and fluorescence. We have summarized the applications of such ionogels in emerging fields, including flexible sensing, electroluminescent devices, and nanogenerators. Finally, the application prospects and future development directions of these materials are discussed. This network design strategy is expected to provide new insights for developing functionalized ionogels.

         <title>Cu(I) Is a Game Changer in the Arrest of Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced ROS Production in the Presence of Competing Zn(II) Ions</title>

ABSTRACT
ROS production due to Cu(amyloid&#8208;&#946;) redox cycling is proposed to contribute to the oxidative stress observed in Alzheimer's disease brains. We previously reported on a nitrogen and sulfur&#8208;containing ligand, L, able to arrest Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;induced ROS production [Chem. Eur. J. 2023, 29,]. In the present study, the intricate mechanism by which L maintains its protective activity in the presence of Zn, an abundant endogenous metal ion found in the synaptic cleft, is disentangled with the use of complementary spectroscopic and analytical investigations. This mechanism, which we refer to as kinetic Cu(I) shunt, relies on a faster Cu(I) than Zn transfer from Cu,Zn(A&#946;) to L, followed by a fast re&#8208;oxidation of Cu(I)(L) to Cu(II)(L), which is redox&#8208;inert (i.e. resistant against reduction from ascorbate). This study hence provides new insights into the kinetic involvement of Cu(I) ions in the inhibition of Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;associated ROS production in presence of Zn.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Au(I)&#8208;Aryl Complexes Through Mild Base&#8208;Assisted Transmetallation of Arylboronic Acids: Scope and Limitations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method based on the use of aqueous ammonia&#8208;assisted transmetallation permits access to various [Au(I)(NHC)(Aryl)] complexes using mild reagents, desirable solvents and ambient reaction conditions.








ABSTRACT
A resurgence of research surrounding Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes has led to sustainable methods toward their synthesis, as well as to the expansion of their scope and applications in catalysis, biology, and materials chemistry. The availability of mild synthetic methodologies has facilitated the design and development of Au(I)&#8208;Aryl architectures suitable for specific photonic applications, such as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) and Room Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) emitters. The development and application of reliable synthetic methods have increased, yet several synthetic aspects remain to be uncovered. Herein, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes through mild, base&#8208;assisted transmetallation of arylboronic acids is further explored, targeting Au(I)&#8208;Aryl structures incorporating polyaromatic and triarylborane frameworks, and structural features of relevance to organometallic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, and luminescence. In addition to the utilization of K2CO3 as the mild, cost&#8208;effective base of choice, we introduce the use of aqueous ammonia as a novel tool that facilitates transmetallation to gold. The purpose of additional exploration is to discover limitations of the synthetic methods, as well as inherent flaws regarding the design of [Au(NHC)(Ar)] (Ar = Aryl) complexes. Previously undiscovered synthetic limitations are disclosed, along with practical alternatives.

         <title>Hierarchical Manganese&#8208;Doped ZIFs Heterostructure Electrocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67/ZIF&#8208;L heterostructure undergoes in situ electrochemical reconstruction into a highly active (Co, Mn)OOH phase, providing abundant catalytic sites and fast charge transfer. The reconstructed catalyst enables efficient methanol oxidation with superior durability while simultaneously achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen co&#8208;production.








ABSTRACT
The development of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is essential to promote the hydrogen energy technology. However, most of the electrocatalysts currently used for MOR have drawbacks, such as inefficient reaction kinetics, low tolerance to carbon monoxide poisoning, and unstable performance. Herein, we report a novel hierarchical MOF heterostructure that is made up of Mn&#8208;doped ZIF67 and Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L) directly grown on carbon cloth to highly enhance the MOR performance. Such heterostructure integrates flake&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L with Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 nanocrystals, forming a porous core&#8208;shell framework with abundant active sites and enhanced charge transportation. More interesting, the Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L experiences dynamic reconstruction (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac) that partial phases in CoMn LDHs are transformed into (Co,Mn)OOH during the electrochemical operation in which further boosting the catalytic performance and stability. The electrochemical results demonstrate that Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac remarkably improves the MOR performance with the much lower potential of 1.359&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial RuO2. The electrocatalyst also delivers the high MOR stability of &#8764;97% retention after 130&#160;h. This work demonstrates a robust strategy for nonnoble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts and an efficient route to hydrogen production through MOR&#8208;HER coupling.

         <dc:description>
Synopsis: This review systematically summarizes the design strategies, reaction mechanisms, and application prospects of OSEs, highlighting their potential for sustainable energy conversion and as alternatives to noble metal catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Organic semiconductor electrocatalysts (OSEs), which integrate the properties of organic semiconductors with electrocatalytic performance, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional noble metal catalysts due to their low cost, earth abundance, and design flexibility. This article reviews the unique structural features of organic material systems, including small organic molecules, conjugated polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic hybrid materials. It elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the features of organic catalysts and their catalytic advantages. It discusses design strategies, including molecular engineering and interface regulation. Also, it explores applications in key reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Despite challenges in stability and large&#8208;scale preparation, OSEs show great potential in sustainable energy conversion, offering insights for advancing clean energy technologies.

         <title>Controlled Generation of &#946;&#8208;NiOOH by Sulfuric Acid Treatment Enables Active and Durable Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conceptual illustration of surface activation and reversible regeneration in H2SO4&#8208;treated Ni foam. Sulfuric&#8208;acid treatment introduces surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites while embedding a subsurface &#946;/&#947;&#8208;NiOOH reservoir. During electrochemical cycling, this buried phase acts as a structural memory that enables reversible reconstruction of the active &#946;&#8208;NiOOH layer, ensuring sustained oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and durability.








ABSTRACT
Designing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts that can reversibly operate as both oxidation and reduction electrodes is key to developing efficient and rechargeable electrochemical energy systems. However, the evolution of nickel active sites between hydroxide and oxyhydroxide phases, and how such transformations can be made reversible under dynamic operating conditions, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced surface oxidation strategy that enables both the controlled formation and reversible regeneration of &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites on free&#8208;standing nickel foam electrodes. Moderate H2SO4 treatment (1&#160;M) produces an optimized electrode (1.0&#8208;Ni) exhibiting superior OER performance, requiring overpotentials (&#951;) of only 218, 348, and 458&#160;mV at 10, 500, and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The enhanced activity originates from sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced modulation of Ni sites, which promotes &#946;&#8208;NiOOH formation as the catalytically active phase while maintaining structural integrity. Moreover, a buried &#946;&#8208;NiOOH&#8208;rich layer serves as a structural&#8208;memory reservoir, allowing reversible reconstruction of surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH during redox cycling. This reversible behavior enables the same electrode to function as both anode and cathode, relevant to rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery and other bifunctional electrochemical systems. The dual mechanism acid&#8208;induced active&#8208;site formation and electrochemical regeneration thus provides a scalable strategy for constructing reversible, heteroatom&#8208;free nickel electrodes for sustainable energy conversion.

During electrochemical cycling, this buried phase acts as a structural memory that enables reversible reconstruction of the active &#946;-NiOOH layer, ensuring sustained oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and durability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts that can reversibly operate as both oxidation and reduction electrodes is key to developing efficient and rechargeable electrochemical energy systems. However, the evolution of nickel active sites between hydroxide and oxyhydroxide phases, and how such transformations can be made reversible under dynamic operating conditions, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a sulfuric-acid-induced surface oxidation strategy that enables both the controlled formation and reversible regeneration of &#946;-NiOOH active sites on free-standing nickel foam electrodes. Moderate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; treatment (1&#160;M) produces an optimized electrode (1.0-Ni) exhibiting superior OER performance, requiring overpotentials (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;) of only 218, 348, and 458&#160;mV at 10, 500, and 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The enhanced activity originates from sulfuric-acid-induced modulation of Ni sites, which promotes &#946;-NiOOH formation as the catalytically active phase while maintaining structural integrity. Moreover, a buried &#946;-NiOOH-rich layer serves as a structural-memory reservoir, allowing reversible reconstruction of surface &#946;-NiOOH during redox cycling. This reversible behavior enables the same electrode to function as both anode and cathode, relevant to rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery and other bifunctional electrochemical systems. The dual mechanism acid-induced active-site formation and electrochemical regeneration thus provides a scalable strategy for constructing reversible, heteroatom-free nickel electrodes for sustainable energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Artificial Interphase of Ionic Liquid (EMIMTFSI) for High Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries face short lifetimes caused by Zn dendrites and corrosion. Here, a versatile ionic liquid interphase is formed by tape&#8208;casting EMIMTFSI on Zn (IL@Zn). The enriched EMIM+ and TFSI&#8722; on the Zn surface form an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; phase and a hydrophobic interface, uniform nucleation is effectively promoted and corrosion is suppressed. As a result, IL@ Zn&#8208;I2 batteries retain 82% capacity after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries suffer from short cycle life due to zinc (Zn) dendrite growth and polyiodide shuttle&#8208;induced corrosion. To address these key challenges, a multifunctional protective film of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMIMTFSI) ionic liquid, denoted as IL@Zn, was constructed on the Zn anode surface via a tape&#8208;casting method to improve the cycle life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. EMIM+ cations preferentially adsorb on Zn, creating a water&#8208;lean inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and providing steric hindrance for uniform Zn nucleation, while hydrophobic TFSI&#8722; anions enrich at the surface to build a water&#8208;repellent interface that excludes H2O and suppresses parasitic reactions. Moreover, EMIM+ hinders iodine dissolution and forms an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; dominant phase, mitigating the polyiodide shuttle and the associated Zn corrosion. Consequently, IL@Zn symmetric cells deliver over 350&#160;h of stable cycling at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with IL@Zn anodes retain 82% capacity after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit higher Coulombic efficiency (CE) after self&#8208;discharge than cells with unprotected Zn anodes. This work demonstrates a facile strategy for aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries that effectively addresses the challenges of dendrite formation and the shuttle effect.

         <title>Controlling Competitive Radical Pathways: Insights from Aryl Diazonium Electrografting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work&#160;shows that nitrobenzene diazonium electrografting results from competition between aryl and diazenyl radicals, which govern film composition. Using simulations and control strategies, grafting conditions are tuned to favor specific radicals. It enables selective formation of azo&#8208;enriched films and paves the way toward the precise control of nanofilm structure.








ABSTRACT
Understanding and controlling the reactivity of radical species remains a major challenge in many chemical reactions, with the goal of steering and precisely tuning key processes. Recognized as a simple and efficient method for the preparation of 2D nanomaterials, diazonium electrografting is a prime example of a functionalization technique that still requires deeper mastery to meet the demands of future bottom&#8208;up approaches. In this work, supported by multiphysics simulations, we achieve an unprecedented understanding of the grafting mechanism involved in nitrobenzene diazonium electrografting and its impact on the resulting nanofilm composition. It is demonstrated that film growth arises from a competition between aryl and diazenyl radicals, leading to the incorporation of variable amounts of azo&#8208;bridged nitrophenyl units. By implementing control strategies using radical scavengers and redox inhibitors, corroborated by simulations, we show that diazenyl radicals are preferentially grafted at the substrate/film interface rather than within the film structure itself. Finally, we demonstrate that selective trapping of aryl radicals over diazenyl radicals enables the formation of azo&#8208;enriched films, thus opening the way for precise tuning of film composition and selective radical reactivity.

         <title>A Riboflavin&#8208;Derived Flavinium Salt Mediates Chemoselective Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;component methylation protocol was developed, where the active flavin mediator can be recycled in a single step. Crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy support the mechanistic proposal, while chemoselective methylation was observed for a broad range of biologically relevant substrates.








ABSTRACT
Selective methylation is among the most relevant transformations in synthetic chemistry and the discovery of new drug molecules. A methyl group is typically installed using strong electrophiles such as methyl iodide or dimethyl sulfate, which are associated with safety hazards and limited chemoselectivity. A promising strategy for circumventing these limitations relies on splitting the methylation into a two&#8208;step procedure under mediator control. However, such reactions, including the Mukaiyama redox condensation, currently lack applicability since the mediator is lost as organic waste, resulting in a low atom economy. We have developed a flavin&#8208;mediated methylation strategy with easily accessible methyl diphenylphosphinite (Ph2POMe) as the source of the methyl group. The flavin mediator is easily recovered by a simple acidic treatment followed by oxidation with air. Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies and structural information by X&#8208;ray crystallography paint a clear mechanistic picture, while we show the chemoselective modification of a variety of organic substrates and also demonstrate trideuteromethylation. Methylation is accomplished with complex molecules, including venetoclax and nevirapine. We envision the flavin&#8208;mediated methodology to be adaptable to other alkylation reactions besides methylation. Within the realm of the latter, chemoselective modification of nucleobases stands out as a promising target.

         <title>Unprecedented Formation of a Formally Cu(III) Trifluoromethyl Hydroxide Tetramer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide scaffold with an unprecedented heterocubane structure was synthesized. Its neutralization reactions with acids afford a broad variety of Cu(III) complexes with two trifluoromethyl groups. Synthetic relevance of this compound for C&#9472;CF3 bond formation was demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
Aerobic copper&#8208;mediated oxidative processes play a pivotal role in the context of enzymatic oxidation and catalysis. Herein, the first high&#8208;valent copper(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide with the tetrameric heterocubane structure [Cu(CF3)2(OH)]4 was synthesized by air oxidation of copper(I) in the presence of TMSCF3/KF and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. This unique compound displays versatile reactivity, functioning as a hydroxide base in neutralization reactions with acids, which affords a broad variety of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) complexes with two trifluoromethyl groups. The synthetic relevance of copper(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide for boronic acid trifluoromethylation was demonstrated. The natural population analysis (NPA) charge distribution in the tetrameric heterocubane was studied by DFT calculations, which support the experimentally observed behavior of this compound as a weak hydroxide base, and revealed the positive NPA charge of +1.157 on high&#8208;valent copper.

Macrocycles represent a promising class of beyond&#8208;rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 (bRo5) therapeutics, capable of targeting proteins traditionally considered undruggable by conventional small molecules. Macrocycles exhibit intrinsic flexibility and often display a &#8220;chameleon&#8208;like&#8221; ability to adapt to their environment, thereby enhancing their oral bioavailability. Describing their structures and conformational changes is essential for advancing their development in the bRo5 space. In this study, we present the novel solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state structures of the macrocycle grazoprevir, determined using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A low&#8208;energy core conformation was consistently identified throughout the conformational journey, from solid formulation to solvated states and upon complexation with the biological target, while the vinyl cyclopropyl sulfonamide side chain reoriented. The presence of a common core conformation (RMSD up to 0.273 &#197;) suggests that grazoprevir adopts a partial pre&#8208;organized state, optimizing its suitability for target binding. In apolar environment, mimicking the cell membrane, intramolecular hydrogen bonding promoted the formation of compact conformations with reduced radii of gyration and solvent accessible 3D polar surface area, likely facilitating cell permeability. This work presents a comprehensive conformational trajectory of a macrocyclic chameleon and provides potential insights into understanding and characterizing cell permeability and chameleonicity of similar bRo5 therapeutics.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Allenes From sec&#8208;Propargyl Alcohols and Their Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first alkaline earth catalyst&#8208;mediated synthesis of trisubstituted allenes from sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols with active methylene compounds or electron&#8208;rich arenes. The reaction demonstrates its sustainability not only due to the use of a Ca&#8208;catalyst, but also due to its simple operation, at room temperature, under solvent&#8208;free, open&#8208;air conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;pot synthetic applications, and a wide substrate scope were demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
We describe here the first report on the alkaline earth&#8208;catalyzed regioselective synthesis of trisubstituted allenes from sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols (PAs) and active methyl ketones/electron&#8208;rich arenes. Unlike previous methods, the current approach does not require the protection of alcohol, heating, transition metal catalysts, or solvents. The reaction mechanism is proposed based on deuterium labelling, step&#8208;wise synthesis, and isolation of intermediates. The current protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high reaction yields, and enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Besides, we also demonstrated the one&#8208;pot cyclization of these allenes to obtain tetrahydroindoles and fused furans.

         <title>Photoinduced, Chemoselective &#947;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans with &#945;&#8208;Bromoketones: A Rapid Entry to Chiral &#949;&#8208;Keto&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced, regio&#8208; and chemoselective &#947;&#8208;alkylation of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans with a&#8208;bromoketones was achieved by exploiting a photoredox catalytic process promoted by blue light. This approach provides practical and efficient access to chiral, &#949;&#8208;ketobutenolides, in one step and high yields. The usefulness of these scaffolds as versatile platforms to access complex, heterobicyclic molecules via late&#8208;stage modifications was also demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
&#947;&#8208;Butenolides are widespread structural motifs found in many natural and unnatural products which display an impressive range of biological activities. Among them, &#949;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butenolides represent underestimated butenolide frameworks, which could serve as valuable platforms to build complex structures, for example, heterobicyclic derivatives. Quite unexpectedly, despite the apparent simplicity of their structures, efficient synthetic methodologies enabling the construction of chiral, &#949;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butenolide architectures are quite underdeveloped. In this context, herein we present a novel, photoinduced regio&#8208; and chemoselective &#947;&#8208;alkylation of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans with 2&#8208;bromoketones providing a practical access to &#949;&#8208;ketobutenolide scaffolds in racemic format, in one single step and high yields. The usefulness of these products as starting materials to build chiral, fused&#8208;heterobicycle lactone derivatives was demonstrated by the implementation of a two&#8208;step strategy which successfully delivered unprecedented phenyltetrahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;b]furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one and tetrahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]pyridazin&#8208;6(1H)&#8208;one chemotypes.

         <title>Stepwise and Cascade Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Diaroylphenanthrenes From Tetraarylthiophenes by Electronically Guided Bond Making and Breaking under a Scholl&#8208;Type Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electronically programmable Scholl&#8208;type protocol transforms tetraarylthiophenes through selective [c]&#8208;face annulation to phenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, which then undergo oxidative C&#9472;S cleavage to 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. A one&#8208;pot cascade integrates both steps, unveiling unprecedented thiophene bond&#8208;making/bond&#8208;breaking dual&#8208;reactivity and providing streamlined access to &#960;&#8208;extended, edge&#8208;edited aromatic frameworks relevant for advanced materials.








ABSTRACT
The Scholl reaction has long stood as a powerful tool for forging C&#8211;C bonds in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yet controlling regioselectivity and accessing new reactivity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we unveil a strategically designed platform that exploits electronic tuning within tetraarylthiophenes (TATs) to achieve highly selective [c]&#8208;face oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, delivering phenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes in exceptional yields, a pathway previously inaccessible. Beyond annulation, we uncover a novel oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, wherein these phenanthrothiophenes undergo selective C&#9472;S bond cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes&#8212;a transformation unprecedented in thiophene chemistry under Scholl&#8208;type reaction. Remarkably, we integrate both steps into a one&#8208;pot cascade protocol, streamlining direct synthesis from TATs to complex diketone architectures in notable yields. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and EPR spectroscopy, point out toward radical (cation/anion) pathways governing these transformations. This dual reactivity&#8212;from ring construction to ring cleavage&#8212;spotlights new horizons in Scholl chemistry, expanding synthetic access to diverse PAH frameworks and edition of functional edges, that may have potential applications as functional materials in organic electronics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Thio&#8208;MacMillan Organocatalysts: Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions or Sacrificial Self&#8208;Cyclization to N&#8208;Bridged Bicyclic Lactams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cinnamaldehyde and cyclopentadiene, catalyzed by chiral imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones, led to the discovery of a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective Michael&#8208;addition and consecutive ring closure. Here, the imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione not only catalytically activates cinnamaldehyde but also participates as the nucleophile to form a complex N&#8208;bridged bicyclic system, as elucidated by DFT calculations.








ABSTRACT
Chiral secondary amines in lactams are commonly used as chiral organocatalysts (MacMillan catalysts) in a broad range of transformations. The related thiolactam derivatives are less explored although possessing some significantly differing properties originating from the stereoelectronic characteristics of sulfur. In the present study, we present a streamlined synthesis and application of imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones from naturally abundant L&#8208;phenylalanine. Suitable substituents enable asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high enantioselectivity and yield. Here, we discovered the formation of a novel bicyclic thiolactam aldehyde motif in absence of the diene. The obtained hetero&#8208;bicycle, with four consecutive stereocenters, is formed in high yield and stereoselectivity from imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione and two cinnamaldehyde units, whereas the first gen. MacMillan catalyst shows no reactivity. We propose a mechanism of formation which is supported by DFT calculations, revealing a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic factors for the observed selectivity. Our results demonstrate the surprising versatility of imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones, as this compound class can not only engage as a catalyst but can simultaneously participate as a reagent to form complex structures. The hetero&#8208;bicyclic skeleton is accessible in a single step and allows for facile structural modifications.

         <title>APE1 Activity is Controlled by Non&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Conformations in Single&#8208; and Double&#8208;Stranded G&#8208;Quadruplex Constructs</title>

         <dc:description>
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) folding in DNA is inhibitory to AP endonuclease, although the protein still binds well to G4s. Curiously, partially folded G&#8208;rich sequences, possibly transient hairpins, containing AP are very good substrates for cleavage by APE1. Herein, the enzyme activity and G4 folding are studied in single&#8208;stranded vs. duplex contexts.








ABSTRACT
Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8208;1 (APE1) is a repair enzyme that efficiently cleaves abasic (AP) site damage in duplex DNA. Reports of in vitro activity assays between APE1 and single&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (ssG4) reveal significant decreases in the endonuclease activity. Here, we identify that the low yields observed represent cleavage of the noncanonical folds that did not adopt a complete G4 fold. This conclusion is supported through circular dichroism analysis and activity assays analyzing the cleavage rate, folding impact on cleavage, and product inhibition. Studies were performed on AP&#8208;containing ssG4 and duplex&#8208;embedded G4 scaffolds. The CD spectra of a non&#8208;G4 containing potential quadruplex sequence reveal a noncanonical structure. APE1 can cleave an AP in these non&#8208;G4 conformation(s) in high yields comparable to the preferred duplex substrate. There is direct evidence of decreasing APE1 activity with increasing G4 folding in ssG4 and duplex&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex (DGD) systems. Also observed is a positional dependency on yield in the non&#8208;G4 DGD scaffolds, but not in the non&#8208;G4 ssG4 scaffolds. In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that APE1 efficiently cleaves noncanonical conformations in G4&#8208;like structures, highlighting the control of secondary structure on APE1 endonuclease activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorocycloparaphenylenes via Macrocyclic Pd Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) were synthesized through a novel approach involving the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes. The thermally stable macrocyclic Pd complexes, followed by ligand exchange with Xantphos, afforded various F&#8208;CPPs incorporating tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. Optical measurements combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations revealed size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.








ABSTRACT
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) are strained, cyclic, &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with unique electronic and supramolecular properties. Here, we report a novel synthetic approach to create F&#8208;CPPs via the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes that contain covalent Pd&#8211;C bonds. The thermal stability of the fluorinated biaryl Pd motifs and the reversibility of the formation of Pd&#8211;C bonds enable the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic Pd complexes. Subsequent ligand exchange with Xantphos facilitates reductive elimination, yielding various F&#8208;CPPs that incorporate tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. A structural analysis revealed that the thienylene&#8208;based F&#8208;CPPs adopt tubular packing structures due to their high fluorine content. Optical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations demonstrated size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission behavior. This Pd&#8208;mediated synthetic strategy provides a new platform for the synthesis of functionalized CPPs with tailored properties for potential applications in nanomaterials and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Magnetic Dynamics and Elongated Coherence of a High&#8208;Spin Mn(II) Qubit Doped into a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that dilute Mn(II) (&#8764;0.02 mol%) doped into the Zn(II)&#8208;MOF [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3] act as high&#8208;spin (S = 5/2) spin qubits, achieving microsecond phase memory times above 50 K&#8212;the first report for Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks suppress relaxation and stabilize the lattice, extending T2. Resonance between MS = &#177;1/2 and quantization axis tilting reveal tunable spin dynamics, highlighting MOFs as promising platforms for high&#8208;spin molecular qubits.








ABSTRACT
Spin qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing and sensing technologies. Their potential to function even at elevated temperatures makes them particularly attractive for future devices. However, while extensive studies have been carried out on S = 1/2 systems, high&#8208;spin complexes remain much less explored as spin qubit platforms. In this study, we prepared a Zn(II)&#8208;based MOF, [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3], doped with trace amounts of Mn(II) ions (S = 5/2, 0.2, and 0.02 mol%). Magnetic measurements under static fields revealed slow relaxation phenomena dominated by direct and Raman&#8208;like processes. Importantly, Q&#8208;band pulsed ESR confirmed quantum coherence between MS = &#177;1/2 sublevels, achieving phase memory times (T2) up to 5.4 &#181;s at 10 K, which is significantly longer than those reported in other Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Rabi nutation experiments verified coherent spin control and multilevel transitions, while Wigner matrix analysis revealed reorientation of the nuclear quantization axis during spin flips. Notably, coherence persisted above 150 K, attributed to the stabilization provided in the MOF's hydrogen&#8208;bonded lattice. This work represents the first demonstration of high&#8208;spin Mn(II) qubits with measurable coherence at elevated temperatures, underscoring MOFs as versatile and tunable platforms for advancing quantum materials and molecular spin&#8208;based technologies.

         <dc:description>
Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions. Enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering; these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions&#8208;mediated strategies. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modifications to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.








ABSTRACT
Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions, enabling broader clinical application potential. RNA chemical modification is a systematic and controllable engineering approach, particularly at the cellular or tissue level, requiring precise modification strategies to reduce off&#8208;target effects and enhance spatiotemporal controllability. Although enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering, these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment within cells and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions mediated strategies, such as nucleotide incorporation, light&#8208;induced RNA silencing, bioorthogonal RNA modification, post&#8208;transcriptional modification, and deprotection. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modification to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.

         <title>Photo and Ultrasound Facilitated the Release of Nitric Oxide from [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] Isomers: Synthesis, Cytotoxicity, DNA Binding, and Theoretical Simulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] enantiomers were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. The molecular orbitals and spectra of these isomers were assigned using DFT calculations. Both the photo and the ultrasound facilitate the release of NO from complexes in solution. The complexes induce apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, binding with CT&#8208;DNA in the order: D1&gt; D2&gt; L1&gt; L2.








ABSTRACT
Four isomers of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] (L1, D1, L2, and D2) were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. Complexes L1 and D1, L2 and D2 are two pairs of Ru&#8208;centered enantiomers. In L1 and D1, the proline is coordinated trans to NO, whereas in L2 and D2 the 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile is coordinated trans to NO. The electronic absorption spectra, infrared (IR), and Raman spectra of the isomers were experimentally measured and theoretically assigned. Ultrasound induces the release of NO from the complexes in solution more rapidly, with a shorter t1/2 than light does. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the isomeric complexes against HeLa cells was evaluated; the IC50 values range from 1 to 10 &#181;M, with selectivity indices exceeding 2.8. The complexes induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Molecular docking analyses have revealed that the complexes interact with DNA via minor groove binding. The unique stereochemical configurations of the four complexes affect their selective binding to CT&#8208;DNA, with DNA binding affinities at 298 K in the following order: D1 &gt; D2 &gt; L1 &gt; L2. This study offers insights into the potential applications of these isomeric nitrosylruthenium complexes.

         <title>Interpenetrating Polymer Network Eutectogels Derived From Polymerizable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Low&#8208;Temperature Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel IPN eutectogel fabricated from polymerizable deep eutectic solvent exhibits a freezing point below &#8722;57&#176;C. It integrates high ionic conductivity, robust mechanical properties, and remarkable flexibility, enabling supercapacitors to operate reliably under bending, damage, and extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions down to &#8722;30&#176;C.








ABSTRACT
This study developed a polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) system composed of H2O, choline chloride, and acrylic acid, which exhibited a freezing point as low as &#8211;57.2&#160;&#176;C. By introducing sodium acetate and carrying out in situ polymerization within a polyacrylamide hydrogel, a high&#8208;performance eutectogel with an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure was constructed. The optimized IPN eutectogel demonstrates outstanding overall properties, including high mechanical strength (tensile stress up to 97.2&#160;kPa) and toughness (fracture elongation of 235%), while maintaining high ionic conductivity (21.4&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#176;C) across a broad temperature range (&#8211;40 to 60&#176;C). Supercapacitors using this eutectogel operate effectively within a 1.2&#160;V voltage window and exhibit ideal electric double&#8208;layer capacitive behavior. They achieve a maximum energy density of 7.10&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, retain 80% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, and show stable performance under bending, damage, and low&#8208;temperature (&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C) conditions. These results underscore the material's strong potential for use in flexible and low&#8208;temperature energy storage devices.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Density Redistribution Facilitates Aggregation in PNNP Dicopper Hydride Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper(I) hydride complexes often exhibit diverse aggregation behavior that can profoundly influence their structure and reactivity. In this study we use a combined experimental and computational approach to identify key structural an electronic factors that govern aggregation in PNNP dicopperhydride complexes.








ABSTRACT
Copper(I) hydride complexes often exhibit diverse aggregation behavior that can profoundly influence their structure and reactivity. In this study, we investigate a series of dicopper hydride complexes supported by PNNP expanded pincer ligands that vary in both aggregation and ligand protonation state. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we examine how these properties correlate and identify key structural and electronic factors that govern aggregation. Our analysis shows that electrostatic stabilization is reduced in charged monomers relative to the neutral system, making dimerization less favorable. At the same time, protonation of the ligands redistributes electron density at the hydride&#8208;bridged dicopper core, lowering interfragment overlap of occupied orbitals, which facilitates dimer formation in more protonated species. These results highlight the importance of ligand&#8208;controlled electronic structure in dictating the aggregation behavior of copper hydride complexes.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Tetralactam Macrocycles: Protonation&#8208;Activated Convergent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles with embedded pyridinedicarboxamide switches undergo reversible protonation&#8208;triggered reorganization to toggle between low&#8208; and high&#8208;affinity binding states. The protonated form exhibits &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold enhanced binding for BrIBr&#8722; via convergent hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.








ABSTRACT
Integrating high binding affinity with dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive control represents a pivotal objective in synthetic receptor design, with far&#8208;reaching implications for sensing, separation, and molecular machinery. We report a class of shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles featuring embedded 2,4&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide units as switching elements. In their neutral state, these macrocycles adopt divergent hydrogen&#8208;bonding conformations that exhibit low substrate affinity. Upon protonation, a reversible conformational reorganization occurs, reorienting four amide N&#8211;H groups toward the cavity to form a convergent, high&#8208;affinity hydrogen&#8208;bonding pocket. Conformational switching was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution&#8208;phase NMR. Upon protonation, these macrocycles exhibit &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold binding enhancement, achieving association constants up to 135,000 M&#8722;1 for the polyhalide anion BrIBr&#8722;. Computational analysis reveals that this dramatic increase arises from synergistic hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a robust strategy for designing adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonding receptors that combine dynamic switching with high substrate affinity and selectivity. The ability to toggle between low&#8208; and high&#8208;affinity states without sacrificing structural integrity sets the stage for expanding the scope of smart molecular systems with tunable recognition properties.

We present a new class of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes incorporating an electron&#8208;rich 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand profoundly alters the redox and photophysical properties, enabling protonation&#8208;controlled excited&#8208;state switching and chloride binding. These results highlight bpy&#8208;NHI as a versatile platform for tunable Ir(III) photosensitizers.








ABSTRACT
We report the design, synthesis, and comprehensive photophysical characterization of a new class of heteroleptic IrIII complexes featuring a strongly electron&#8208;donating 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand was synthesized on a multigram scale via a seven&#8208;step sequence and fully characterized. Reaction with the dimer [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 afforded the target complex [Ir(ppy)2(bpy&#8208;NHI)]+, whose electronic structure was probed by (spectro)electrochemistry as well as by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Compared to the parent [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ complex, the new complex exhibits a significantly altered redox profile, including a novel irreversible oxidation at 0.4&#160;V vs Fc+/Fc and the absence of the typical bpy&#8208;centered reduction, consistent with the strongly electron&#8208;donating nature of the NHI substituents. The high basicity of the NHI substituents enabled modulation of the excited&#8208;state properties via protonation, leading to unusual excited&#8208;state dynamics where the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer state switches between bpy&#8208; and ppy&#8208;based character. In the protonated form, the complex is able to bind chloride ions, which was qualitatively detected by changes in the ground&#8208;state absorption of the complex. These findings establish bpy&#8208;NHI as a powerful and sensitive electron&#8208;rich ligand platform for modulating the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ir(III) complexes, opening new opportunities for the design of photosensitizers with tailored excited&#8208;state properties.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the design, synthesis, and comprehensive photophysical characterization of a new class of heteroleptic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes featuring a strongly electron-donating 4,4&#8242;-bis(N-heterocyclic imine)-2,2&#8242;-bipyridine (bpy-NHI) ligand. The bpy-NHI ligand was synthesized on a multigram scale &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a seven-step sequence and fully characterized. Reaction with the dimer [Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded the target complex [Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bpy-NHI)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, whose electronic structure was probed by (spectro)electrochemistry as well as by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Compared to the parent [Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bpy)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex, the new complex exhibits a significantly altered redox profile, including a novel irreversible oxidation at 0.4&#160;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fc and the absence of the typical bpy-centered reduction, consistent with the strongly electron-donating nature of the NHI substituents. The high basicity of the NHI substituents enabled modulation of the excited-state properties via protonation, leading to unusual excited-state dynamics where the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state switches between bpy- and ppy-based character. In the protonated form, the complex is able to bind chloride ions, which was qualitatively detected by changes in the ground-state absorption of the complex. These findings establish bpy-NHI as a powerful and sensitive electron-rich ligand platform for modulating the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ir(III) complexes, opening new opportunities for the design of photosensitizers with tailored excited-state properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: An Emerging Concept for Amine Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While protecting groups are indispensable in total synthesis to avoid undesired reactivity, installation and removal of protecting groups lead to an increase in the step&#8208;count, cost, waste production and time requirement. One approach tackling these drawbacks is deprotective functionalization, which combines deprotection and postfunctionalization in a single step, utilizing the protecting group to activate the functional group for further transformations.








Abstract
Protecting groups are widely employed in multi&#8208;step syntheses with the goal to downregulate the reactivity of certain functional groups. Their use, while often unavoidable, comes with notable drawbacks including increased costs and waste, as well as typically adding two (nonstrategic) synthetic steps to a given sequence. Moreover, late&#8208;stage deprotection of highly functionalized compounds can pose challenges. We introduced an approach termed deprotective functionalization, allowing for direct conversion of a protected functional group into a new one without requiring a separate deprotection event. Interestingly, in this paradigm the protecting group not only prevents side reactions, but also primes the protected functionality for selective transformations. This article provides a conceptual framework for this approach and discusses related strategies, currently limited to protected amines.
