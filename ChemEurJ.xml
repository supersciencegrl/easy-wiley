      <title>Continuous Flow Pickering Emulsion Catalysis in Droplet Microfluidics Studied with In&#8208;situ Raman Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Pickering emulsions (PEs), emulsions stabilized by solid particles, have shown to be a versatile tool for biphasic catalysis. Here we report a droplet microfluidic approach for flow PE (FPE) catalysis, further expanding the possibilities for PE catalysis beyond standard batch PE reactions. This microreactor allowed the inline analysis of the catalytic process with  in&#8208;situ  Raman spectroscopy, as demonstrated for the acid&#8208;catalyzed deacetalization of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal to form benzaldehyde. Furthermore, the use of the FPE system showed a nine fold improvement in yield compared to the simple biphasic flow system (FBS), highlighting the advantage of emulsification. Finally, FPE allowed an antagonistic set of reactions, the deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel condensation, which proved less efficient in FBS due to rapid acid&#8208;base quenching. The droplet microfluidic system thus is a versatile new extension of PE catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on a Base&#8208;Free Terminal Uranium Phosphinidene Metallocene</title>
      <dc:description>The first stable base&#8208;free terminal uranium phosphinidene metallocene is presented. Its structure and reactivity have been studied in detail and compared to that of the corresponding thorium derivative. Salt metathesis reaction of the methyl iodide uranium metallocene Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; 2 U(I)Me ( 2 , Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; = &#951; 5 &#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me 3 C) 3 C 5 H 2 ) with Mes*PHK (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;(Me 3 C) 3 C 6 H 2 ) in THF yields the base&#8208;free terminal uranium phosphinidene metallocene, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; 2 U=PMes* ( 3 ). In addition, density functional theory (DFT) studies suggest substantial 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the uranium phosphinidene [U]=PAr moiety, which result in a more covalent bonding between the [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; 2 U] 2+ and [Mes*P] 2&#8208; fragments than that for the related thorium derivative. This difference in bonding causes different reactivity patterns. Therefore, the uranium derivative 3 may act as a Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; 2 U(II) synthon releasing the phosphinidene moiety (Mes*P:) when treated with alkynes or a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, thiazoles, ketazines, bipy, organic azides, diazene derivatives, ketones, and carbodiimides.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis&#8208;Controlled Polymorphism and Optical Properties of the Phyllosilicate&#8208;Analogous Borosulfates M[B2(SO4)4] (M = Mg, Co)</title>
      <dc:description>Increased synthetic control in borosulfate chemistry leads to the access of various new compounds. Herein, we unravel the polymorphism for phyllosilicate&#8208;analogous borosulfates by adjusting the oleum (65% SO  3  ) content. The new polymorphs &#946;&#8208;Mg[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ] and &#945;&#8208;Co[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ] both consist of similar layers of alternating borate and sulfate tetrahedra, but differ in the position of octahedrally coordinated cations. The &#945;&#8208;modification comprises cations between the layers, whereas in the &#946;&#8208;modification cations are embedded within the layers. With this approach, we also achieved phase pure compounds of the respective polymorphs &#945;&#8208;Mg[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ] and &#946;&#8208;Co[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ]. Tanabe&#8208;Sugano analysis on the Co  2+  polymorphs reveal weak ligand field splitting and give insights into the coordination behaviour of two dimensional borosulfate anions for the first time. DFT calculations confirmed previous  in silico  experiments and enabled an assignment of the polymorphs by comparing the total electronic energies. We characterised the compounds by SC&#8208;XRD, PXRD, FT&#8208;IR and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy, TGA and DFT calculations.

      <title>Polyhydrido Copper Nanoclusters with a Hollow Icosahedral Core: [Cu30H18{E2P(OR)2}12] (E=S or Se; R=nPr, iPr or iBu)</title>
      <dc:description>
The structurally precise polyhydrido copper nanocluster (NC) [Cu30H18{S2P(OnPr)2}12] which contains an unprecedented inner hollow Cu12 icosahedral core has been fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal neutron diffraction; while Ag12 and Au12 inner hollow icosahedra encircled within Ag44 and Au32 NCs have been reported by Bigioni and Wang in 2013 and 2019, respectively. Pd doping on the Cu30 NC led to the isolation of Pd&#8722;Cu bimetallic NCs, which exhibit a linear [(PdH2)2&#8722;]&#8208;centered icosahedral core. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;Y. Saillard, C.&#8197;W. Liu, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001449).

Gold catalysis promoted the domino reaction to form four bonds and two aromatic rings, dramatically increasing the structural complexity of the starting materials. This domino reaction pushed the switch of the diversity&#8208;directed total synthesis of six dictyodendrins, and accelerated the medicinal application study of dictyodendrin derivatives.

      <title>Esterification of Tertiary Amides: Remarkable Additive Effects of Potassium Alkoxides for Generating Hetero Manganese&#8211;Potassium Dinuclear Active Species</title>
      <dc:description>
A manganese&#8211;potassium heterodinuclear catalyst was found to exhibit higher catalytic activity than manganese dinuclear catalysts toward catalytic esterification of tertiary N,N&#8208;dialkyl aliphatic amides through C&#8722;N bond cleavage. Based on stoichiometric reactions, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations, the reaction mechanism was elucidated, in which the potassium supported the manganese to construct an appropriate transition state for nucleophilic attack of an alkoxide to a carbonyl moiety of an amide.

      <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Bis(silylene)&#8208;Coordinated Calcium and Divalent Lanthanide Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide complexes of Eu (  1  ) and Yb (  2  ) coordinated by a chelating pyridine&#8208;based bis(silylene) ligand were isolated and fully characterized. Compared to the Eu(II) complex  1  , the Yb(II) complex  2  presents a lower thermal stability, resulting in the activation of one Si(II)&#8208;N bond and formation of an Yb(III) complex (  3  ), which features a unique silylene&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;amido ligand. The different thermal stability of  1  and  2  points towards reduction&#8208;induced cleavage of one Si(II)&#8208;N bond of the bis(silylene) ligand. Successful isolation of the corresponding redox&#8208;inert bis(silylene) Ca(II) complex (  5  ) was achieved at low temperature and thermal decomposition into a Ca(II) complex (  4  ) bearing the same silylene&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;amido ligand was identified. In this case, the thermolysis reaction proceeds through another, non&#8208;redox induced, mechanism. An alternative higher yielding route to  4  was developed through an  in situ  generated silylene&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;amine proligand.</dc:description>

Compared to the Eu(II) complex  1  , the Yb(II) complex  2  presents a lower thermal stability, resulting in the activation of one Si(II)&#8208;N bond and formation of an Yb(III) complex (  3  ), which features a unique silylene&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;amido ligand. The different thermal stability of  1  and  2  points towards reduction&#8208;induced cleavage of one Si(II)&#8208;N bond of the bis(silylene) ligand. Successful isolation of the corresponding redox&#8208;inert bis(silylene) Ca(II) complex (  5  ) was achieved at low temperature and thermal decomposition into a Ca(II) complex (  4  ) bearing the same silylene&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;amido ligand was identified. In this case, the thermolysis reaction proceeds through another, non&#8208;redox induced, mechanism. An alternative higher yielding route to  4  was developed through an  in situ  generated silylene&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;amine proligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Determination of configuration and conformation of a Reserpine derivative with seven stereogenic centers using molecular dynamics with RDC&#8208;derived tensorial constraints</title>
      <dc:description>NMR&#8208;based determination of the configuration of complex molecules containing many stereocenters is often not possible using traditional NOE data and coupling patterns. Making use of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) we were able to determine the relative configuration of a natural product containing seven stereocenters including a chiral amine lacking direct RDC data. To identify the correct relative configuration out of 32 possible ones, experimental RDCs were used in three different approaches for data interpretation: by fitting experimental data based singular value decomposition (SVD) using a single alignment tensor and either (i) a single conformer or (ii) multiple conformers, or alternatively (iii) using molecular dynamics simulations with tensorial orientational constraints (MDOC). Even though in all three approaches one and the same configuration could be selected and clear discrimination between possible configurations was achieved, the experimental data was not fully satisfied by the methods based on single tensor approaches. While these two approaches are faster, only MDOC is able to fully reproduce experimental results, as the obtained conformational ensemble adequately covers the conformational space necessary to describe the molecule with inherent flexibility.</dc:description>

      <title>A Mechanistic Dichotomy in Two&#8208;Electron Reduction of Dioxygen Catalyzed by N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dimethylated Porphyrin Isomers</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective two&#8208;electron reduction of O2 to H2O2 has been achieved by nonplanar N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin isomers as organocatalysts, showing the highest TON among homogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts. Hydrogen bonding between pyrrolic protons of reduced porphyrinoids and O2 plays an important role to control the reaction mechanism in catalytic O2 reduction. The cover art describes different mechanisms of the O2 reduction by the two isomers on the background showing shining Mt. Tsukuba in the sunset. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Kojima et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000942).

      <title>MUC1 Aptamer&#8208;Capped Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles for Navitoclax Resistance Overcoming in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. In the last years, navitoclax has emerged as a possible treatment for TNBC. Nevertheless, rapid navitoclax resistance onset has been observed thorough Mcl&#8208;1 overexpression. As a strategy to overcome Mcl&#8208;1&#8208;mediated resistance, herein we present a controlled drug co&#8208;delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) targeted to TNBC cells. The nanocarrier is loaded with navitoclax and the Mcl&#8208;1 inhibitor S63845 and capped with a MUC1&#8208;targeting aptamer (apMUC1&#8208;MSNs(Nav/S63845)). The apMUC1&#8208;capped nanoparticles effectively target TNBC cell lines and successfully induce apoptosis, overcoming navitoclax resistance. Moreover, navitoclax encapsulation protects platelets against apoptosis. These results point apMUC1&#8208;gated MSNs as suitable BH3 mimetics nanocarriers in the targeted treatment of MUC1&#8208;expressing TNBC.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Chemical communication between macromolecules was studied by observing the controlled single chain collapse that ensues the exchange of a metal cross&#8208;linker between two polymer chains. The rhodium (I) organometallic cross&#8208;linker transfer from a low molecular weight collapsed polybutadiene to a larger polymer was followed using size exclusion chromatography. The increased effective molarity in the larger polymer seems to be the driving force for the metal migration.

      <dc:description>A Ru&#8208;doping strategy is reported to substantially improve both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity of Ni/Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) for overall water splitting. As&#8208;synthesized Ru&#8208;doped Ni/Fe MIL&#8208;53 MOF nanosheets grown on nickel foam (MIL&#8208;53(Ru&#8208;NiFe)@NF) afford HER and OER current density of 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  at an overpotential of 62 and 210 mV, respectively in alkaline solution with a nominal Ru loading of ~110 &#956;g cm  &#8208;2  . When using as both anodic and cathodic pre&#8208;catalyst, MIL&#8208;53(Ru&#8208;NiFe)@NF enables overall water splitting at a current density of 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  for a cell voltage of 1.6 V without iR compensation, which is much superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art RuO  2  &#8208;Pt/C&#8208;based electrolyzer.

      <title>Selective Detection for Methomyl Pesticide via Catalytic Chemosensing Assay</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic chemosensing assay (CCA), a new indicator displacement assay, is developed for selective detection of methomyl, a highly toxic pesticide. Herein, a trimetallic complex, {FeII(dmbpy)(CN)4&#8211;[PtII(DMSO)Cl]2&#8211;RuII(bpy)2(CN)2}, 1, (dmbpy = 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) is synthesized as a task&#8208;specific catalyst to initially reduce and degrade methomyl into CH3SH/CH3NH2/CH3CN/CO2. The thus&#8208;produced CH3SH interacts with the trimetallic complex to displace the luminophore, cis&#8208;RuII(bpy)2(CN)2, for monitoring. Other pesticides, including organophosphates and similar carbamate pesticides, remained intact under the same catalytic conditions; a selective sensing signal is only activated when 1 recognizes methomyl. Furthermore, 1 can be applied to detect methomyl in real water samples. According to the luminescent mode of the assay, the method detection limit (MDL) of 1 to methomyl (LD50 = 17 mg/kg) was 1.12 mg/L.</dc:description>

      <title>Aryl Triflates in On&#8208;Surface Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of aryl triflates in on&#8208;surface C&#8208;C coupling is reported. It is shown that the triflate group in aryl triflates enables regioselective homo coupling with preceding or concomitant hydro&#8208;detriflation on Cu(111). Three different symmetrical &#960;&#8208;systems with two and three triflate functionalities were used as monomers leading to oligomeric conjugated &#960;&#8208;systems. The cascade, comprising different intermediates at different reaction temperatures as observed for one of the molecules, proceeds via initial removal of the trifluoromethyl sulfonyl group to give an aryloxy radical which in turn is deoxygenated to the corresponding aryl radical. Thermodynamically driven regioselective 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer leads to a translocated aryl radical which in turn undergoes coupling. For a sterically more hindered bistriflate, where one  ortho  position was blocked, dehydrogenative coupling occurred at remote position with good regioselectivity. Starting materials, intermediates as well as products were analysed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Structures and suggested mechanism were further supported by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Desymmetrization of Perylenediimide Bay&#8208;Regions using selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction s from Dinitro Substituted derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>The bay&#8208;decoration of perylenediimide (PDI) is an attractive approach to tune the optoelectronic properties of the dye with the possibility to break its backbone planarity preventing the formation of aggregates. Usually performed through successive bis&#8208;bromination of PDI and pallado&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling, this approach classically leads to symmetric triads. We describe herein an efficient synthetic strategy for the desymmetrization of the accepting PDI core starting from its bis&#8208;nitration. In this respect, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings (SMC) were carried out on a mixture of 1,6&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;dinitroPDI regioisomers to graft triphenylamine donating moieties and reach Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor triads. Investigating deeply the reactivity of dinitroPDI derivatives toward SMC allowed us to access unprecedented asymmetric p&#8208;conjugated PDI&#8208;centered triads accounting for the peculiar reactivity of dinitroPDI. &#160;Those 1,6&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;PDI based triads, prepared as regioisomeric mixture, were successfully separated and their spectroscopic, crystallographic and optoelectronic differences are reported.</dc:description>

A fully earth&#8208;abundant system for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is described. The combination of new heteroleptic CuI complexes as photosensitizers with a known Ni catalyst showed the selective formation of CO, with comparable yields to some noble&#8208;metal systems.

      <title>Role of Coordination Number and Geometry in Controlling the Magnetic Anisotropy in Fe(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets</title>
      <dc:description>Since the last decade, the focus in the area of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) has been shifting constructively towards the development of single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs) based on transition metals and lanthanides. While ground&#8208;breaking results are witnessed for the Dy(III) based SIMs, significant results were also obtained for some mononuclear transition metal SIMs. Among others, studies based on Co(II) ion is very prominent as they often exhibit high magnetic anisotropy or zero&#8208;field splitting parameter and offer a large barrier height for magnetisation reversal. While Co(II) possibly holds the record of having the largest number of zero&#8208;field SIMs known for any transition metal ions, controlling the magnetic anisotropy in these systems are is still a challenge. In addition to the modern spectroscopic techniques, theoretical studies, especially ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 approaches, have been used to unfold the electronic structure of various Co(II) SIMs. In this article, with some selected examples, we aim to showcase how varying the coordination number from two to eight, and geometry around the Co(II) centre alters the magnetic anisotropy. This offers some design principles for the experimentalists to target new generation SIMs based on Co(II) ion. Additionally, some important Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Ni(II) complexes exhibiting large magnetic anisotropy and SIM properties are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Influence of Metal&#8208;Alkyls on Early&#8208;Stage Ethylene Polymerization over a Cr/SiO2 Phillips Catalyst: A Bulk Characterization and X&#8208;ray Chemical Imaging Study</title>
      <dc:description>The Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst has taken a central role in ethylene polymerization since its invention in 1953. The uniqueness of this catalyst is related to its ability to produce broad molecular weight distribution (MWD) PE materials as well as that no co&#8208;catalysts are required in order to attain activity. Nonetheless, co&#8208;catalysts in the form of metal&#8208;alkyls can be added for scavenging poisons, enhancing catalyst activity, reducing the induction period, and tailoring polymer characteristics. The activation mechanism and related polymerization mechanism remain elusive, despite extensive industrial and academic research. Here, we show that by varying the type and amount of metal&#8208;alkyl co&#8208;catalyst, we can tailor polymer properties around a single Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst formulation. Furthermore, we show that these different polymer properties exist in the early stages of polymerization. We have used conventional polymer characterization techniques, such as Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), for studying the metal&#8208;alkyl co&#8208;catalyst effect on Short Chain Branching (SCB), Long Chain Branching (LCB) and Molecular Weight Distribution (MWD) at the bulk scale. In addition, Scanning Transmission X&#8208;ray Microscopy (STXM) was used as a synchrotron technique to study the PE formation in the early stages: allowing us to investigate the produced type of early&#8208;stage PE within one particle cross&#8208;section with high energy resolution and nanometer scale spatial resolution.</dc:description>

A binary protein condensate that mimics postsynaptic densities revealed high pressure sensitivity. This may help to gain a better understanding of the biophysical causes of pressure&#8208;related neurological disorders, such as the high&#8208;pressure neurological syndrome experienced by deep&#8208;sea divers.

      <title>An Expansion of Crystalline Sponge X&#8208;ray Analysis to Elucidate the Molecular Structure of Reactive Compounds via Ion Pair Formation</title>
      <dc:description>The crystalline sponge (CS) method allows structural elucidation of a target compound (guest) in solution by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction through trapping the guest into the CS framework. In principle, the CS method is inapplicable to reactive compounds that break the CS framework, such as acidic, basic, or nucleophilic ones. Here, a solution to this problem is disclosed wherein an ion pair of the guest compound is formed during the guest&#8208;soaking step by adding a suitable reagent. The ion pair can be observed and doesn&#8217;t damage the CS framework. Using the developed method, amino, guanidino, and amidino compounds have been successfully analyzed as ion pairs with sulfonic acids. Practical utility has been shown because the absolute configurations of optically resolved amine derivatives were revealed with only a few micrograms. This demonstrates that the ion&#8208;pair&#8208;soaking method is simple and expands the range of compounds applicable to the CS method.</dc:description>

The effect of acids on the CO  2  reduction was investigated using the Zn porphyrin&#8208;Re dyad and BIH. Acetic acid, a relatively strong Br&#248;nsted acid, rapidly causes the porphyrin&#8217;s color to fade upon irradiation and dramatically decreases CO production, whereas proper weak Br&#248;nsted acids such as 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol and phenol enhance the CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Strategy for Identification of Higher Order, Green Fluorescent Host&#8208;Guest Pairs Compatible with Living Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Engineered miniprotein host&#8208;small molecule guest pairs could be utilized to design new processes within cells as well as investigate fundamental aspects of cell signaling mechanisms. However, the development of host&#8208;guest pairs capable of functioning in living systems has proven challenging.

The optimal host&#8208;guest pair produced a 10&#8208;fold increase in green fluorescence signal upon binding. Biophysical characterization clearly demonstrated higher order supramolecular assembly, which could be visualized on the surface of living yeast cells using a turn&#8208;on fluorescence readout. This work further defines evolutionary design principles to afford host&#8208;guest pairs with stoichiometries other than 2:1 and enables the identification of spectrally orthogonal host&#8208;guest pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Dihydroraputindole D via Enantioselective Benzoylation of a 1,3&#8208;Diol Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>The first enantioselective synthesis of a raputindole derivative is reported. The cyclopenta[f]indoline system was assembled by Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of a propargylic acetate&#8208;substituted indoline precursor. The key step is the enantioselective desymmetrizing benzoylation of a prochiral 1,3&#8208;diol employing Trost's ProPhenol catalyst system, which has been applied for the first time to a cyclic molecule carrying geminal hydroxymethyl groups. We also report an Ir&#8208;catalyzed isomerization/Diels&#8208;Alder dimerization that occurred instead of the originally intended Crabtree&#8208;type hydrogenation. (&#8211;)&#8208;Dihydroraputindole D was obtained in 17 steps and 8% overall yield starting from dihydroxyacetone. In combination with quantum chemical calculations of the ECD spectra, our synthesis also allowed us to determine the absolute configuration (5S,7R) of the natural product (+)&#8208;raputindole D from the Rutaceous plant  Raputia simulans.</dc:description>

In combination with quantum chemical calculations of the ECD spectra, our synthesis also allowed us to determine the absolute configuration (5S,7R) of the natural product (+)&#8208;raputindole D from the Rutaceous plant  Raputia simulans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Quantifying the overall efficiency of circularly polarized emitters</title>
      <dc:description>An increasing number of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) molecular emitters has been developed in the recent years and many of them are intended for applications in which high overall CPL efficiencies are requested. In order to have a complete picture of the efficiency of a CPL emitter, the dissymmetry factor (  g  lum  ) is not enough. In the following we propose a new quantity, named CPL brightness (B  CPL  ), which takes into account absorption extinction coefficient and quantum yield along with the  g  lum  factor. We calculated B  CPL  value for more than 180 compounds reported in the literature and we analyse data distribution for the main classes of CPL molecular emitters. Such tool can be employed to put into context new CPL active compounds and to direct the choice of molecular systems for specific CPL applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Only Lewis Pairs of Rhodium with s, p and d&#8208;Block Metals</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;only Lewis pairs (MOLPs) in which the two metal fragments are solely connected by a dative M&#8594;M bond represent privileged architectures to acquire fundamental understanding of bimetallic bonding. This has important implications in many catalytic processes or supramolecular systems that rely on synergistic effects between two metals. However, a systematic experimental/computational approach on a well&#8208;defined class of compounds is lacking. Here we report a family of MOLPs constructed around the Rh(I) precursor [(  &#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Rh(PMe  3  )  2  ] (  1  ) with a series of  s  ,  p  and  d  &#8208;block metals, mostly from the main group elements, and investigate their bonding by computational means. Among the new MOLPs, we have structurally characterized those formed by dative bonding between  1  and MgMeBr, AlMe  3  , GeCl  2  , SnCl  2  , ZnMe  2  and Zn(C  6  F  5  )  2,  as well as spectroscopically identified the ones resulting from coordination to MBAr  F  (M = Na, Li; BAr  F  &#8208;  = [B(C  6  H  2  &#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  )  4  ]  &#8208;  ) and CuCl. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, including  103  Rh NMR, is used to probe the formation of Rh&#8594;M bonds. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of those provides clear trends. As anticipated, greater bond covalency is found for the more electronegative acids, while ionic character dominates for the least electronegative nuclei, though some degree of electron sharing is identified in all cases.</dc:description>

      <title>Impact of molecular&#160;size and shape&#160;on the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of chiral tricarboxamides.&#160;A comparative study</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a comparative investigation of the chiral amplification features of a series of three families of&#160;  C  3  &#8208;symmetric tricarboxamides: 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzenetricarboxamides (TPBAs), benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) and oligo(phenylene ethynylene) tricarboxamides (OPE&#8208;TAs). As previously observed for BTAs and OPE&#8208;TAs, a similar dichroic response is obtained for TPBAs decorated with three, two or only one chiral side chain bearing stereogenic centers, thus confirming the efficient transfer of point chirality to the supramolecular helical aggregates. Unlike BTAs and OPE&#8208;TAs, the chiral amplification ability of TPBAs&#160; in majority rules experiments &#160;shows a negligible dependence on the number of chiral centers per monomeric unit, and stands the largest among the series of tricarboxamides. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the rotation angle between the TPBA units in the helical stack is intermediate to that observed for BTAs and OPE&#8208;TAs. This feature strongly conditions the steric interactions between vicinal molecules in the stack and the final chiral amplification outcome. Theoretical calculations furthermore show that achiral side chains favor the interdigitation of the helical aggregates and thereby the formation of bundle superstructures.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The structural deterioration of archetypical, well&#8208;faceted metal organic frameworks (MOFs) has been evaluated upon exposure to an acidic environment (H  2  S). Experimental results show that the structural damage highly depends on the nature of the hybrid network ( e.g., softness of the metal ions, hydrophilic properties, among others ) and the crystallographic orientation of the exposed facets. Microscopy images show that&#160; HKUST&#8208;1 with well&#8208;defined octahedral (111) facets is completely deteriorated, &#160;ZIF&#8208;8 with preferentially exposed (110) facets exhibits a large external deterioration with the development of holes or cavities in the mesoporous range, whereas UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  &#160;with (111) exposed facets, and PCN&#8208;250 with (100) facets does not reflect any sign of surface damage. Despite the selectivity in the external deterioration, X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption measurements confirm that indeed all MOFs suffer an important internal deterioration, these effects being more severe for MOFs based on softer cations (e.g.,&#160; Cu&#8208;based HKUST&#8208;1 and &#160;Fe&#8208;based PCN&#8208;250). These structural changes have inevitable important effects in the final adsorption performance for CO  2  &#160;and CH  4  &#160;at low and high pressures.</dc:description>

Herein, the viability of aza&#8208;BODIPY skeleton as a promising system for achieving thermal activated delayed fluorescent probes (TADF) emitting in this target region is demonstrated for the first time.

      <title>RhIII&#8208;Catalyzed Double Dehydrogenative Coupling of Free 1&#8208;Naphthylamines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
      <dc:description>
A double oxidative coupling: The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed double oxidative coupling of free 1&#8208;naphthylamines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters were achieved, leading to the formation of a class of biologically important alkylidene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indoles scaffolds.







Abstract
The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed, consecutive double C&#8722;H oxidative coupling of free 1&#8208;naphthylamine and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters through C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H and C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bonds is reported. The one step reaction leads to the formation of biologically important alkylidene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indoles scaffolds. This efficient process is much more synthetically convenient and useful than others because the starting materials, such as 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives are readily available and the free amine serves as a directing group.

      <title>Unveiling the occurrence of Co(III) in NiCo layered electroactive hydroxides. The role of distorted environments</title>
      <dc:description>Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based layered hydroxides constitute a unique class of two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials with exceptional chemical diversity, physicochemical properties and outstanding performance as supercapacitors and overall water splitting catalysts. Recently, the occurrence of Co(III) in these phases has been proposed as a key factor that enhance their electrochemical performance.

The PXRD and XAS characterization alert about the occurrence of Co(III) as a consequence of the increment in the Ni content.

Hence, a strong modification of the electronic properties leaves the system prone to oxidation, by the appearance of Co localized electronic states on the Fermi level. This work combines a microscopic interpretation supported by a multiscale crystallochemical analysis, regarding the so called synergistic redox behavior of Co and Ni, offering fundamental tools for the controllable design of highly efficient electroactive materials.

      <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Sulfur Ylides to Dihydrobenzothiepines</title>
      <dc:description>
Many reactions of sulfonium ylides suffer from stoichiometric waste production through release of the sulfur moiety. An atom&#8208;economical synthesis of heterocycles has now been developed, which showcases a novel mode of sulfonium ylide reactivity. Treatment of S&#8208;homopropargyl sulfonium ylides with a gold catalyst under mild conditions results in an atom&#8208;economical, charge&#8208;accelerated sulfonium [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement, giving access to a variety of novel dihydrobenzo[b]thiepines without release of any sulfur by&#8208;product. More information can be found in the Communication by N. Maulide et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000622).

The polar head group and the long alkyl chains in the backbone contribute to a lipid&#8208;like behavior, while an alkyl ammonium group provides the ability for crucial electrostatic interaction for the transfection process.

      <dc:description>Development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for the conversion of amines is of great importance, but has remained a challenging task. Here, a bis&#8208;anthracene fused porphyrin (AFP) was synthesized in a high yield via a facile synthetic protocol, which involves a Suzuki coupling for the conjugation of two anthracene groups with a porphyrin ring, followed by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation.

      <title>Photoredox&#8208;mediated Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions of Amino&#8208;Acids, Peptides and Peptide&#8208;derived drugs</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen isotopically labelled compounds are essential diagnostic tools in drug research and development, as they provide vital information about the biological metabolism of drug candidates and their metabolites. Herein we report a photoredox&#8208;initiated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) protocol which efficiently and selectively introduces deuterium or tritium at C(sp 3 )&#8211;H bonds, utilizing heavy water (D 2 O or T 2 O) as the hydrogen isotope source, and a guanidine base. This protocol has been successfully applied to the high incorporation of deuterium and tritium in several amino acids (lysine, glycine and proline), and also in small peptides which contain these. These tritium&#8208;labelled peptides of several commercial drugs and natural products are suitable for application in biological experiments, such as ligand&#8208;binding assays, or absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies.</dc:description>

      <title>1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Photon Phototherapeutic Effects of Ru(II) Polypyridine Complexes in the Hypoxic Centre of Large Multicellular Tumour Spheroids and Tumour&#8208;Bearing Mice</title>
      <dc:description>During the last decades, photodynamic therapy (PDT), an approved medical technique, has received increasing attention to treat certain types of cancer. Despite recent improvements, the treatment of large tumors remains a major clinical challenge due to the low ability of the photosensitizer (PS) to penetrate a 3D cellular architecture and the low oxygen concentrations present in the tumour centre. To mimic the conditions found in clinical tumors, exceptionally large 3D multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTSs) with a diameter of 800 &#181;m were used in this work to test a series of new Ru(II) polypyridine complexes as 1&#8208;Photon and 2&#8208;Photon PSs. These metal complexes were found to fully penetrate the 3D cellular architecture and to generate singlet oxygen in the hypoxic centre upon light irradiation. While having no observed dark toxicity, the lead compound of this study showed an impressive phototoxicity upon clinically relevant 1&#8208;Photon (595 nm) or 2&#8208;Photon (800 nm) excitation with a full eradication of the hypoxic centre of the MCTSs. Importantly, this efficacy was also demonstrated on mice bearing an adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial tumour.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Precursor Design Strategies for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Functional Oxides: It's All in the Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Limiting the energetic budget during the solution processing of oxides is one of the most crucial considerations, adhering to green chemistry principles. Low&#8208;temperature strategies require thought&#8208;out adjustments at the level of the chemical precursor system. Specific reagents can be added to trigger auto&#8208;combustion reactions, influence the sol&#8208;gel network, obtain UV&#8208;sensitive precursors or to tune the intermediates/transition states during decomposition. The successful implementation will also open up novel applications in flexible electronics and hybrid materials. For more details see the Review by W. Marchal et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;9070&#8197;ff.

Two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanocrystals are often made by a chemical delamination process in water, which involves a layered oxide phase as the starting material. The exfoliated nanosheets have aspect ratios comparable with that of a paper sheet, and they are also very flexible. Oxide nanosheets can be used as building blocks for the construction of improved or entirely new functional materials for a wide range of application areas: nanoelectronics, energy storage, catalysis and tribology, to name just a few.

      <dc:description>
Sustainable solution methods for flexible metal oxide semiconductors are increasingly attractive to address environmental challenges through simple, cost&#8208;effective, and printable large&#8208;area manufacturing processes. This review reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, flexible, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistor semiconductors; nanoparticles, combustion, aqueous, annealing, and novel deposition approaches to low&#8208;temperature fabrication of solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors, as well as novel structures, gate dielectrics, and electrodes. In addition, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductor&#8208;based flexible systems, including displays, sensors, memory devices, neuromorphic devices, and energy&#8208;harvesting devices (solar cells and nanogenerators) are described.

      <dc:description>
Laser synthesis of colloids emerged in recent years as a versatile approach to access a library of clean oxide nanoparticles relying on only four main strategies running at room temperature and ambient pressure: laser ablation in liquid, laser fragmentation in liquid, laser melting in liquid and laser defect&#8208;engineering in liquid. Here, established laser&#8208;based methodologies are reviewed through the presentation of a panorama of oxide nanoparticles. For more information, see the Review by V. Amendola, S.

      <dc:description>
This review outlines key variables in photoreactions that affect epitaxial and polycrystalline thin film growth, including precursor materials, laser wavelength, laser fluence, and carbon. In addition, the features of the photoreaction process that can be controlled at a low temperature by oxygen non&#8208;stoichiometry are examined. Likewise, functions that are neither achieved by developing a gradient structure nor controlled by a thermal equilibrium reaction are detailed. For more details, see the Review by T.

      <title>Frontispiece: Photochemistry in the Low&#8208;Temperature Processing of Metal Oxide Thin Films by Solution Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
Photochemistry can play a leading role in the low&#8208;temperature processing of metal&#8208;oxide thin films, affecting the different stages of the chemical solution deposition process. These stages include everything from the synthesis of the precursor solution to the formation of the amorphous metal&#8208;oxygen network in the film and its subsequent crystallization into the oxide phase. The lowering of the processing temperature provides environmental and economic benefits, in addition to technological advantages, such as the integration of functional oxide layers into flexible electronics systems. For more information, see the Minireview by Bretos, Calzada and co&#8208;workers on page&#8197;9277&#8197;ff.

      <title>Hierarchical Mn3O4 Anchored on 3D Graphene Aerogels via C&#8722;O&#8722;Mn Linkage with Superior Electrochemical Performance for Flexible Asymmetric Supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon nanohorns: An asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed by using graphene aerogels reacted either with Mn(AC)2 to form the anode or CNH to form the cathode (see scheme).







Abstract
Flexible asymmetric supercapacitors are more appealing in flexible electronics because of high power density, wide cell voltage, and higher energy density than symmetric supercapacitors in aqueous electrolyte. In virtues of excellent conductivity, rich porous structure and interconnected honeycomb structure, three dimensional graphene aerogels show great potential as electrode in asymmetric supercapacitors. However, graphene aerogels are rarely used in flexible asymmetric supercapacitors because of easily re&#8208;stacking of graphene sheets, resulting in low electrochemical activity. Herein, flower&#8208;like hierarchical Mn3O4 and carbon nanohorns are incorporated into three dimensional graphene aerogels to restrain the stack of graphene sheets, and are applied as the positive and negative electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors devices, respectively. Besides, a strong chemical coupling between Mn3O4 and graphene via the C&#8208;O&#8208;Mn linkage is constructed and can provide a good electron&#8208;transport pathway during cycles. Consequently, the asymmetric supercapacitor device shows high rate cycle stability (87.8&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles) and achieves a high energy density of 17.4&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with power density of 14.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (156.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;3) at 1.4&#8197;V.

      <title>London Dispersion and Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions in Bulky Molecules: The Case of Diadamantyl Ether Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkyl groups matter: Complexes between diadamantyl ether (DAE) and water and alcohols with increasing side&#8208;chain size have been studied by using rotational spectroscopy. DAE and the clustering molecules interact through an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond and London dispersion (LD) interactions. The H&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C LD attractions take place between the alkyl groups of the alcohols and those of DAE. The LD interactions increase with increasing size of the alcohol.







Abstract
Diadamantyl ether (DAE, C20H30O) represents a good model to study the interplay between London dispersion and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions. By using broadband rotational spectroscopy, an accurate experimental structure of the diadamantyl ether monomer is obtained and its aggregates with water and a variety of aliphatic alcohols of increasing size are analyzed. In the monomer, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C London dispersion attractions between the two adamantyl subunits further stabilize its structure. Water and the alcohol partners bind to diadamantyl ether through hydrogen bonding and non&#8208;covalent Owater/alcohol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;CDAE and C&#8722;Halcohol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;CDAE interactions. Electrostatic contributions drive the stabilization of all the complexes, whereas London dispersion interactions become more pronounced with increasing size of the alcohol. Complexes with dominant dispersion contributions are significantly higher in energy and were not observed in the experiment. The results presented herein shed light on the first steps of microsolvation and aggregation of molecular complexes with London dispersion energy donor (DED) groups and the kind of interactions that control them.

      <title>Molten&#8208;Salt Media Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Carbon Tubes Containing Encapsulated Co Nanoparticles as a Bifunctional Air Cathode for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Battery power: Cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in a N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube network were synthesized by the molten salt method and developed as an ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalyst. The assembled rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery using Co@N&#8208;CNTs as an air cathode has a power density of 168&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Cost efficient bifunctional air cathodes possessing high electrocatalytic activity are of great importance for the development of secondary Zn&#8208;air batteries. In this work, cobalt nanoparticles are encapsulated within a 3D N&#8208;doped open network of carbon tubes (Co@N&#8208;CNTs) by a molten&#8208;salt synthesis procedure conducted at a high temperature. Physical characterization demonstrates that Co@N&#8208;CNTs are comprised of Co particle inserted carbon tubes with mesoporous tube walls, providing significant active surface area for electrochemical reactions. High electrocatalytic activity of Co@N&#8208;CNTs towards both oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions is due to its well&#8208;developed active surface and a synergistic effect between N&#8208;doped carbon and Co nanoparticles. Both primary and secondary Zn&#8208;air battery cells assembled using Co@N&#8208;CNTs as an air cathode show higher electrochemical performance than similar cells containing commercial Pt/C and Pt/C +RuO2, making the newly developed material a promising alternative to existing metal&#8208;based air cathodes.

      <title>Dodecahedral Au/Pt Nanobowls as Robust Plasmonic Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation under Visible&#8208;Light Illumination</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanocatalysts: Au/Pt nanobowls were fabricated by a facile and template&#8208;free method and used as plasmonic electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. The electrocatalytic activity and stability were highly improved under visible&#8208;light illumination owing to the photothermal and hot&#8208;carrier effect, which were confirmed experimentally.







Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures with large absorption areas under resonant excitation have been utilized extensively in photon&#8208;assisted applications. In this work, dodecahedral Au nanobowls were first prepared by an easy and template&#8208;free method only through the introduction of H2PtCl6 and I&#8722; during the growth procedure.

     alt="Dodecahedral Au/Pt Nanobowls as Robust Plasmonic Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation under Visible&#8208;Light Illumination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plasmonic nanocatalysts &lt;/b&gt;: Au/Pt nanobowls were fabricated by a facile and template&#8208;free method and used as plasmonic electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. The electrocatalytic activity and stability were highly improved under visible&#8208;light illumination owing to the photothermal and hot&#8208;carrier effect, which were confirmed experimentally.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasmonic nanostructures with large absorption areas under resonant excitation have been utilized extensively in photon&#8208;assisted applications. In this work, dodecahedral Au nanobowls were first prepared by an easy and template&#8208;free method only through the introduction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; during the growth procedure. The Au nanobowls show electron&#8208;field enhancement due to the high curvature of the bowl edge, the open region, and dodecahedral morphology. Au/Pt nanobowls, which couple plasmonic Au and catalytic Pt, were then constructed as plasmonic electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. The mass activity reached 497.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible&#8208;light illumination, which is 1.9 times that measured in the dark. Simultaneously, the electrocatalytic stability is also greatly improved under light excitation. The enhanced properties of the plasmonic Au/Pt electrocatalysts are ascribed to the synergistic effect of the plasmon&#8208;enhanced photothermal and hot&#8208;carrier effects on the basis of experimental investigations. This work thus offers an effective methodology to construct efficient plasmonic electrocatalysts for fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Water Formation in Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Sol&#8208;Gel Routes: Selective Synthesis of Tetragonal and Monoclinic Mesoporous Zirconia as a Case Study</title>
      <dc:description>Several non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel syntheses involving different precursors, oxygen donors, and conditions have been screened aiming to selectively produce mesoporous t&#8208;ZrO2 or m&#8208;ZrO2 with significant specific surface areas. The in situ water formation was systematically investigated by Karl Fisher titration of the syneresis liquids. XRD and nitrogen physisorption were employed to characterize the structure and texture of the ZrO2 samples. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones (acetone, 2&#8208;pentanone, acetophenone), and of ZrCl4 with alcohols (benzyl alcohol, ethanol) or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200 &#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether appear strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Although reaction time and reaction temperature were also important parameters, the presence of water played a crucial role on the structure of the final zirconia: t&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while m&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in the presence of significant amounts of water. 1H and 13C NMR analysis of the syneresis liquids allowed us to identify the main reactions responsible for the formation of water and of the oxide network. The morphology of the most interesting ZrO2 samples was further investigated by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM).</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Topological Landscape of DNA&#8208;Cyclodextrin Nanocomplexes by Molecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report original molecular vectors that ensure broad flexibility to tune the shape and surface properties of plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensates. The prototypic design involves a cyclodextrin (CD) platform bearing a polycationic cluster at the primary face and a doubly&#8208;linked aromatic module bridging two consecutive monosaccharide units at the secondary face, which behaves as a topology&#8208;encoding element. Subtle differences at the molecular level then translate into disparate morphologies at the nanoscale, including rods, worms, toroids, globules, ellipsoids and spheroids. In vitro evaluation of the transfection capabilities revealed marked selectivity differences as a function of nanocomplex morphology. Remarkably high transfection efficiencies were associated to ellipsoidal or spherical shapes with a lamellar internal arrangement of pDNA chains and CD bilayers. Computational studies support that the stability of such supramolecular edifices is directly related to the tendency of the molecular vector to form noncovalent dimers upon DNA templation. Since the stability of the dimers depends on the protonation state of the polycationic clusters, the co&#8208;aggregates display pH responsiveness, which facilitates endosomal scape and timely DNA release, a key step in successful transfection. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Developing Molecularly Targeted DNA Scissors</title>
      <dc:description>Nucleic acid click chemistry was used to prepare a family of chemically modified triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) for application as a new gene&#8208;targeted technology. Azide&#8208;bearing phenanthrene ligands&#8212;designed to promote triplex stability and copper binding&#8212;were &#8216;clicked&#8217; to alkyne&#8208;modified parallel TFOs.

Several of the hybrids provide significant stabilisation toward melting in parallel triplexes (&gt;20 &#176;C) and DNA damage can be triggered upon copper binding in the presence of added reductant. Therefore, the TFO and &#8216;clicked&#8217; ligands work synergistically to provide sequence&#8208;selectivity to the copper cutting unit which, in turn, confers high stabilisation to the DNA triplex. To extend the boundaries of this hybrid system further, a click chemistry&#8208;based di&#8208;copper binding ligand was developed to accommodate designer ancillary ligands such as DPQ and DDPZ.
