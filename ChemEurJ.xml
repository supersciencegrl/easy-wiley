         <title>Strategies to Design Chemocatalytic Racemization of Tertiary Alcohols: State of the Art &amp; Utilization for Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this "Concepts"&#8208;article, the difficulties in racemizing tertiary alcohols are described as well as a summary of the different chemocatalytic concepts to overcome these hurdles and to pave a way for efficiently racemizing of tertiary alcohols. When combined with the enantioselective enzymatic esterification of tertiary alcohols, the racemization protocols enable a DKR to convert the racemates into enantiomerically pure esters of tertiary alcohols, which are of high interest in the field of pharmaceutically active products. Very recently, various research groups have succeeded in solving the challenging task of identifying suitable chemocatalysts for an efficient racemization of tertiary alcohols and simultaneously suppressing unwanted dehydration side&#8208;reactions. It is noteworthy that such methods are based on different, complementary catalysis concepts. Besides Br&#248;nsted acids, oxovanadium catalysts as well as piperidine as a representative of an organocatalyst have been found to be useful for the racemization of each type of alcohols. The latter two types of catalysts also turned out to be compatible with lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution, thus leading to the first two examples of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for chemoenzymatic DKR of tertiary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Silylated Diazoalkynes: New Tools for Bioconjugation of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi&#8208;functionnal reagents bearing a Si&#8208;stabilized diazo function and a terminal alkyne can react with peptides or protein selectively at carboxylic residues in buffered aqueous media. A dramatic kinetic improvement of the conjugation is observed by in&#8208;situ fluoride&#8208;induced desilylation. Post&#8208;functionalization using click chemistry enables a late stage flexible diversification of the alkyne moiety.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Silylated diazoalkynes are stabilized diazo compounds that can selectively react with carboxylic residues in buffered aqueous media. In&#8208;situ fluoride induced desilylation increases this reactivity, leading to a very fast reaction. Application to the selective functionalization of RNase A, followed by post&#8208;functionalization using click chemistry, is described. These new reagents expand the toolbox for native protein modification at carboxylic residues.

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to access new luminescent azaphosphaphenalene motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a swift and versatile palladium cyclization is presented using readily accessible catalysts and starting materials to produce new azaphosphaphenalene motifs. The luminescent properties of these products were evaluated and some of the key compounds had their structure unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis. The phosphorus atom offers interesting possibilities for post functionalization.







Abstract
Using a straightforward sequence of diphosphonylation and a Pd&#8208;catalysed concerted&#8208;metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), a synthetic strategy towards polyaromatic phosphorus containing heterocycles was developed. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of new azaphosphaphenalenes, using easily accessible palladium catalysts and starting materials. The key tetrahydroquinoline intermediates of the reaction were synthesised via a fast and effective procedure and could be isolated as such, or further reacted towards the target polyaromatic structures. The obtained products showed interesting luminescent properties and their emission, excitation and quantum yields were evaluated.

         <title>Solvent Geometry Regulated J&#8208; and H&#8208;Type Aggregates of Photoswitchable Organogelator: Phase&#8208;Selective Thixotropic Gelation and Oil Spill Recovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrated solvent geometry regulated J and H&#8208;type of aggregates of an azobenzene containing photo switchable organogelator (AZO&#8208;4). The supramolecular polymerization of AZO&#8208;4 leads to formation of 1D&#8208;nanofiber, which transforms into small length nanofiber upon UV irradiation due to trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization. This can gelate various hydrocarbon solvent and oil, thus can be used for oil spill recovery applications.







Abstract
We demonstrate supramolecular polymerization and formation of 1D nanofiber of azobenzene based organogelator (AZO&#8208;4) in cyclic hydrocarbon solvents (toluene and methylcyclohexane). The AZO&#8208;4 exhibits J&#8208; and H&#8208;type aggregates in toluene: MCH (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) and MCH: toluene (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) respectively. The type of aggregate was governed by the geometry of the solvents used in the self&#8208;assembly process. The J&#8208;type aggregates with high thermal stability in toluene is due to the enhanced interaction of AZO&#8208;4 &#960;&#8208; surface with the toluene &#960;&#8208;surface, whereas H&#8208;aggregate with moderate thermal stability in MCH was due to the interruption of the cyclic hydrocarbon in van der Waals interactions of peripheral chains of AZO&#8208;4 molecule. The light induced reversible photoisomerization is observed for both J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates. The macroscopic property revealed spontaneous and strong gelation in toluene preferably due to the strong interactions of the AZO&#8208;4 nanofibers with the toluene solvent molecules compared to the MCH. The rheological measurements revealed thixotropic nature of the gels by step&#8208;strain experiments at room temperature. The thermodynamic parameter (&#916;Hm) of gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition was determined for all the gels to get more insight into the gelation property. Furthermore, the phase selective gelation property was extended to the oil spill recovery application using diesel/water and petrol/water mixture.

         <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the reaction of gold(I) hydrides with carbon dioxide was elucidated, revealing a one&#8211;step concerted mechanism leading to the formation of a formate product. A comparative ligand screening suggests that anionic/zwitterionic ligands should be employed experimentally for a successful implementation of a stoichiometric or catalytic reaction at the Au(I)&#8722;H site.







Abstract
We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8722; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8722;. We explored 20&#8197;different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8211;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.

We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8211;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the Cu&#8208;catalysed coupling of alkylboronic esters and aliphatic amines. This mild method is functional group tolerant, and uses O2 from air as the terminal oxidant. Investigation into the mechanism suggest that the boronic ester reacts with an aminyl radical, formed in&#8197;situ, to generate an alkyl radical intermediate.







Abstract
We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.

         <title>TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 Core&#8208;Shell Catalysts for Efficient Oxidation of p&#8208;Diethylbenzene to High Value&#8208;Added Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>

TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 zeolite with core&#8208;shell structure was synthesized and used in the catalytic oxidation of p&#8208;diethylbenzene. The reaction conditions and the oxidation mechanism of p&#8208;diethylbenzene were determined. The synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell zeolite improves the oxidation activity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene, and improves the selectivity of products while taking into account the selectivity of raw materials.







Abstract
To expand the market capacity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene (PDEB), core&#8208;shell zeolite (TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48) is designed as a catalyst for PDEB oxidation. TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 catalyst is synthesized by in&#8208;situ crystallization method and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption, in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS&#8208;NMR). Oxidation of PDEB by H2O2 was investigated systematically in liquid phase. The conversion of PDEB over TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 was 28.1&#8201;% and the total selectivity was 72.6&#8201;%, where the selectivity of EAP (p&#8208;ethylacetophenone) and EPEA (4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol) was 28.6&#8201;% and 44.0&#8201;%, respectively. Compared with TS&#8208;1 and MCM&#8208;48 zeolite, the conversion rate of reactants and the selectivity of products have been significantly improved. The catalytic performance of TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 is derived from its well&#8208;crystallized microporous core and mesoporous shell with regular channels, which make active sites of TS&#8208;1 zeolite in the catalyst be fully utilized and mass transfer resistance be largely reduced. Further through theoretical calculation, we propose that the oxidation of PDEB is the result of the combination and mutual transformation of free radical process and carbocation process. Core&#8208;shell structure ensures the conversion rate of raw materials and improves the selectivity of products.

         <title>Probing the Isolobal Relation between Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;NiP3 and White Phosphorus by Experimental Charge Density Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolobale principle as established by Hoffmann was tested in this work by the highest level of experimental charge density analysis. X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction fitting as well as multipolar modelling showed in accord that [Ni]P3 is a suitable isolobale analogue to white phosphorus. The deep dive into its bonding analysis reveals insights about the differences in reactivity compared to P4.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth analysis of the description of bonding within Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P3 (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, [Ni]P3) employing X&#8208;ray diffraction based multipolar modeling, density functional theory (DFT) as well as an &#8220;experimental wavefunction&#8221; obtained from X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) fitting is presented. The results are compared to DFT calculations on white phosphorus &#8211; an isolobal analogue to [Ni]P3. A complementary bonding analysis shows insights into the reactivity of [Ni]P3. The isolobal principle is reflected in every aspect of our analysis and the employed methods seamlessly predict the differences in reactivity of [Ni]P3 and P4. Crystallographic modeling, solid&#8208;state NMR, and DFT calculations describe the dynamic behavior of the cyclo&#8208;P3 unit in the title molecule.

         <title>Structure and Photophysics of N&#8208;Tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines and their Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysics of a series of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines with O, S, Se, and Te heteroatoms is strongly structure&#8208;dependent. Time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that the O and S dyads possess a pseudo&#8208;equatorial structure and the lowest energy excited singlet state has charge&#8208;transfer character, but the Se and Te dyads possess pseudo&#8208;axial structure and a tolan localised excited state.







Abstract
The study focuses on the structural and photophysical characteristics of neutral and oxidized forms of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines PZX&#8208;tolan with X=O, S, Se, and Te. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses show a pseudo&#8208;equatorial (pe) structure of the tolan substituent in the O, S, and Se dyads, while the Te dyad possesses a pseudo&#8208;axial (pa) structure. DFT calculations suggest the pe structure for O and S, and the pa structure for Se and Te as stable forms. Steady&#8208;state and femtosecond&#8208;time resolved optical spectroscopy in toluene solution indicate that the O and S dyads emit from a CT state, whereas the Se and Te dyads emit from a tolan&#8208;localized state. The T1 state is tolan&#8208;localized in all cases, showing phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. The heavy atom effect of chalcogens induces intersystem crossing from S1 to Tx, resulting in a decreasing S1 lifetime from 2.1&#8197;ns to 0.42&#8197;ps. The T1 states possess potential for singlet oxygen sensitization with a high quantum yield (ca. 40&#8201;%) for the O, S, and Se dyads. Radical cations exhibit spin density primarily localized at the heterocycle. EPR measurements and quasirelativistic DFT calculations reveal a very strong g&#8208;tensor anisotropy, supporting the pe structure for the S and Se derivatives.

Radical cations exhibit spin density primarily localized at the heterocycle. EPR measurements and quasirelativistic DFT calculations reveal a very strong &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-tensor anisotropy, supporting the &lt;i&gt;pe&lt;/i&gt; structure for the S and Se derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Is Simultaneous Binding to DNA and Gyrase Important for the Antibacterial Activity of Cystobactamids?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>

How do they bind ? New cystobactamid derivatives with duplicated triarene unit served to elucidate their bent shape conformation (CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees) by NMR analysis. Elongation of the triarene unit of cystobactamids lead to increased DNA binding affinity implying that they exert their inhibitory activity by interaction with the gyrase itself as well as with DNA via their triarene unit.







Abstract
Cystobactamids are aromatic oligoamides that exert their natural antibacterial properties by inhibition of bacterial gyrases. Such aromatic oligoamides were proposed to inhibit &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions and may serve for specific recognition of DNA. Based on this suggestion, we designed new derivatives that have duplicated cystobactamid triarene units as model systems to decipher the specific binding mode of cystobactamids to double stranded DNA. Solution NMR analyses revealed that natural cystobactamids as well as their elongated analogues show an overall bent shape at their central aliphatic unit, with an average CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees. Our finding is corroborated by the target&#8208;bound structure of close analogues, as established by cryo&#8208;EM very recently. Cystobactamid CN&#8208;861&#8208;2 binds directly to the bacterial gyrase with an affinity of 9 &#956;M, and also exhibits DNA&#8208;binding properties with specificity for AT&#8208;rich DNA. Elongation/dimerization of the triarene subunit of native cystobactamids is demonstrated to lead to an increase in DNA binding affinity. This implies that cystobactamids&#8217; gyrase inhibitory activity necessitates not just interaction with the gyrase itself, but also with DNA via their triarene unit.

Chemodivergent [3+3] annulations: The reactivity of Rh&#8208;enalcarbenoid has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones to deliver functionalized 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,2&#8208;DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines respectively. The structural diversification of 1,2&#8208;DHP and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines gave valuable piperidines, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, 2&#8208;pyridone, hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydroquinolines, and tetrahydroquinolinones.







Abstract
Novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+3] annulations of diazoenals and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones has been disclosed here. The reactivity of diazoenals has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones. In this direction, we report an efficient strategy to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formyl group is necessary for carbenoid [3+3] annulation and the cyclohexyl group is the dictating factor for vinylogous NH&#8208; insertion. The synthetic utility of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines was demonstrated by synthesizing piperidine, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, and 2&#8208;pyridone scaffolds. Further, structural diversification of fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines resulted in the short synthesis of hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydro quinolines and tetrahydroquinolinones via ring opening rearrangement and a new oxidative deformylation, respectively.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Methanol to Formaldehyde Catalyzed by Iron Complex with N3S3&#8208;type Tripodal Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe3+ complex with N3S3&#8208;type tripodal ligand, which has two reversible Fe2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ redox couples in solution in CV, exhibited catalytic oxidation of CH3OH to HCHO under O2, which was studied structurally, spectroscopically, and electrochemically.







Abstract
A Fe3+ complex with N3S3&#8208;type tripod ligand, 1, reacts with O2 in CH3OH to generate formaldehyde, which has been studied structurally, spectroscopically, and electrochemically. Complex&#8197;1 crystallizes as an octahedral structure with crystallographic C3 symmetry around the metal, with Fe&#8208;N=2.2917(17) &#197; and Fe&#8208;S=2.3574(6) &#197;. UV&#8208;vis spectrum of 1 in CH3OH under Ar shows an intense band at 572&#8197;nm (&#1013; 4,100&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1), which shifts to 590&#8197;nm (&#1013; 2,860&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1) by the addition of O2, and a new peak appeared at 781&#8197;nm (&#1013; 790&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1). Such a spectral change is not observed in CH2Cl2. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 1 in CH2Cl2 under Ar gives reversible redox waves assigned to Fe2+/Fe3+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples at &#8722;1.60&#8197;V (&#916;E=69&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;E=71&#8197;mV) vs Fc/Fc+, respectively. In contrast, in CH3OH, the reversible redox waves, albeit accompanied by a positive shift of the Fe2+/Fe3+ couple, are observed at &#8722;1.20&#8197;V (&#916;E=85&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;E=64&#8197;mV) vs Fc/Fc+ under Ar. Interestingly, a catalytic current was observed for the CV of 1 in CH3OH in the presence of CH3ONa under Ar, when the sweep rate was slowed down.

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Cu, Fe, or Ni&#8208;doped Diamane Sheets: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals (Cu, Ni, Fe) can be introduced into diamane in a specific pattern. This process not only enhances the adsorption properties of the reactant but also optimizes the CO2 conversion reaction pathway and promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction. Overall, transition metal&#8208;doped diamane demonstrates promising potential in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Poor mass transfer behavior and inherent activity limit the efficiency of traditional catalysts in electrocatalyzing carbon dioxide reduction reactions. However, the development of novel nanomaterials provides new strategies to solve the above problems. Herein, we propose novel single&#8208;metal atom catalysts, namely diamane&#8208;based electrocatalysts doped with Cu, Fe, and Ni, explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We thoroughly investigated the doping pattern and energetics for different dopants. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the conversion process of CO2 to C1 or C2+ products, utilizing the free energy analysis of reaction pathways. Our results reveal that dopants could only be introduced into diamane following a specific pattern. Dopants significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption ability of diamane, with Fe and Ni proving notably more effective than Cu. After CO2 adsorption, Cu&#8208; and Fe&#8208;doped diamane prefer to catalyze CO2RR, while Ni&#8208;doped diamane favors hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The C&#8722;C coupling reaction on Cu&#8208;hollow diamane, Cu&#8208;bridge diamane, and Fe&#8208;hollow diamane tends to be from C2+ products. Among all examined catalysts, Cu&#8208;hollow diamane shows better electro&#8208;catalytic performance. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of and contributes to the development of diamane&#8208;based electro&#8208;catalysts for CO2RR.

         <title>Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite with Near&#8208;Infrared II Mechanoluminescence for Spatiotemporally Selective Immune Activation in Lymph Nodes</title>

Focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator&#8208;loaded nanomaterial (FURIN) for spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in the lymphatic system in&#8197;vivo. FURIN could be enriched in the lymph node (LN) of mice via subcutaneous injection and the mechanoluminescence (ML) of FURIN in the near&#8208;infrared region enables real&#8208;time, visualized feedback of FUS by bioimaging. FUS with high precision and deep penetration can activate dendritic cells (DCs) in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The immune regulation of the lymphatic system, especially the lymph node (LN), is of great significance for the treatment of diseases and the inhibition of pathogenic organisms spreading in the body. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control of immune cell activation in LN in&#8197;vivo remains a challenge due to tissue depth and off&#8208;target effects. Furthermore, minimally invasive and real&#8208;time feedback methods to monitor the regulation of the immune system in LN are lacking. Here, focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator loaded nanoplatform (FURIN) with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) luminescence is designed to achieve spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in LN in&#8197;vivo. The NIR&#8208;II persistent luminescence of FURIN can track its delivery in LN through bioimaging. Under focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation, the immunomodulator encapsulated in FURIN can be released locally in the LN to activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and the NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence of FURIN provides real&#8208;time optical feedback signals for immune activation. This work points to a FUS mediated, spatiotemporal selective immune activation strategy in&#8197;vivo with the feedback control of luminescence signals via ultrasound responsive nanocomposite, which is of great significance in improving the efficacy and reducing the side effect of immune regulation for the development of potential immunotherapeutic methods in the future.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoxides by A Cyclic Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system with cofactor regeneration was established for the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxides using prochiral sulfildes as substrates. Heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were prepared in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion with &gt;90&#8201;% ee through the cascade catalysis of MsrA, Fus&#8208;SMO and three other auxiliary enzymes (Trx, Trx&#8208;R, and GDH).







Abstract
Optically pure sulfoxides are valuable organosulfur compounds extensively employed in medicinal and organic synthesis. In this study, we present a biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system designed for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. The system involves the cooperation of a low&#8208;enantioselective chimeric oxidase SMO (styrene monooxygenase) with a high&#8208;enantioselective reductase MsrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase A), facilitating &#8220;non&#8208;selective oxidation and selective reduction&#8221; cycles for prochiral sulfide oxidation. The regeneration of requisite cofactors for MsrA and SMO was achieved via a cascade catalysis process involving three auxiliary enzymes, sustained by cost&#8208;effective D&#8208;glucose. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a series of heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were synthesized through this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one step&#8221; cascade reaction. The obtained compounds exhibited high yields of &gt;90&#8201;% and demonstrated enantiomeric excess (ee) values exceeding 90&#8201;%. This study represents an unconventional and efficient biocatalytic way in utilizing the low&#8208;enantioselective oxidase for the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxides.

         <title>Deconstructing Best&#8208;in&#8208;Class Neoglycoclusters as a Tool for Dissecting Key Multivalent Processes in Glycosidase Inhibition</title>

Deconstructing for understanding: A structure&#8208;activity relationship study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors shed new lights on the contribution of chelation and statistical rebinding mechanisms underlying high multivalent effect in glycosidase inhibition. This experimental&#8211;theoretical approach provides insights from various dimensions (statistical, stoichiometric, electrostatics) and relevant guidelines for the design of optimized multivalent enzyme inhibitors.







Abstract
Multivalency represents an appealing option to modulate selectivity in enzyme inhibition and transform moderate glycosidase inhibitors into highly potent ones. The rational design of multivalent inhibitors is however challenging because global affinity enhancement relies on several interconnected local mechanistic events, whose relative impact is unknown. So far, the largest multivalent effects ever reported for a non&#8208;polymeric glycosidase inhibitor have been obtained with cyclopeptoid&#8208;based inhibitors of Jack bean &#945;&#8208;mannosidase (JB&#945;&#8208;man). Here, we report a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors. This approach provides a valuable tool to understand the complex interdependent mechanisms underpinning the inhibitory multivalent effect. Combining SAR experiments, binding stoichiometry assessments, thermodynamic modelling and atomistic simulations allowed us to establish the significant contribution of statistical rebinding mechanisms and the importance of several key parameters, including inhitope accessibility, topological restrictions, and electrostatic interactions. Our findings indicate that strong chelate&#8208;binding, resulting from the formation of a cross&#8208;linked complex between a multivalent inhibitor and two dimeric JB&#945;&#8208;man molecules, is not a sufficient condition to reach high levels of affinity enhancements. The deconstruction approach thus offers unique opportunities to better understand multivalent binding and provides important guidelines for the design of potent and selective multiheaded inhibitors.

         <title>Immobilised Ruthenium Complexes for the Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular catalysts immobilised on mesoporous indium tin oxide (meso&#8208;ITO) electrodes are shown to be a promising candidate for the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The reactions proceed in acidic aqueous media to prevent competing substrate decomposition.







Abstract
Abundantly available biomass&#8208;based platform chemicals, including 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), are essential stepping stones in steering the chemical industry away from fossil fuels. The efficient catalytic oxidation of HMF to its diacid derivative, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), is a promising research area with potential applications in the polymer industry. Currently, the most encouraging approaches are based on solid&#8208;state catalysts and are often conducted in basic aqueous media, conditions where HMF oxidation competes with its decomposition. Efficient molecular catalysts are practically unknown for this reaction. In this study, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalysis of surface&#8208;bound molecular ruthenium complexes for the transformation of HMF to FDCA under acidic conditions. Catalyst immobilisation on mesoporous indium tin oxide electrodes is achieved through the incorporation of phosphonic acid anchoring groups.

     alt="Immobilised Ruthenium Complexes for the Electrooxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular catalysts immobilised on mesoporous indium tin oxide (&lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-ITO) electrodes are shown to be a promising candidate for the electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The reactions proceed in acidic aqueous media to prevent competing substrate decomposition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abundantly available biomass-based platform chemicals, including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), are essential stepping stones in steering the chemical industry away from fossil fuels. The efficient catalytic oxidation of HMF to its diacid derivative, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), is a promising research area with potential applications in the polymer industry. Currently, the most encouraging approaches are based on solid-state catalysts and are often conducted in basic aqueous media, conditions where HMF oxidation competes with its decomposition. Efficient molecular catalysts are practically unknown for this reaction. In this study, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalysis of surface-bound molecular ruthenium complexes for the transformation of HMF to FDCA under acidic conditions. Catalyst immobilisation on mesoporous indium tin oxide electrodes is achieved through the incorporation of phosphonic acid anchoring groups. Screening experiments with HMF and further reaction intermediates revealed the catalytic route and bottlenecks in the catalytic synthesis of FDCA. Utilising these immobilised electrocatalysts, FDCA yields of up to 85&#8201;% and faradaic efficiencies of 91&#8201;% were achieved, without any indication of substrate decomposition. Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) post-electrocatalysis unveiled the desorption of the catalyst from the electrode surface as a limiting factor in terms of catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The reactivity of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)] with main group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is explored. These studies yield novel cationic derivatives of the isolobal P homolog of the ubiquitous benzene ligand, featuring group 14, 15, and 16 as well as mixed group 14/16 element substituents.







Abstract
The electrophilic functionalization of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)] (A) and its mono&#8208;oxidized counterpart [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)][SbF6] (B) with reactive main&#8208;group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is shown to be a reliable method for the selective functionalization of the hexaphosphabenzene ligand. Depending on the electrophile used, the regioselectivity of the functionalization can be adjusted. Using group 16 electrophiles, the trisubstituted compounds [{Cp*Mo}2{(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;1,3&#8208;(SePh)2&#8208;2&#8208;Br&#8208;P3)}][TEF] (1), [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;(EPh)3&#8208;P3)][SbF6] (E=S (2), Se (3)) as well as the side product [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;P4)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P(SPh)2)][SbF6] (4) are obtained. By switching to phosphenium ions as group 15 electrophiles, the ring&#8208;inserted products [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P7R2)][TEF] (R=Cy (5), iPr (6)) are isolated, showing an unprecedented P7R2 structural motif. Furthermore, the reaction with MeOTf yields the dimeric [{Cp*Mo}4(1,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;&#956;4,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P6)(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)2][TEF]2 (7) as the first example of a complex featuring two interconnected cyclo&#8208;P6 middle deck ligands. Finally, by combination of the methylation step with Ph2Se2, the mixed group 14/16 complex [{Cp*Mo}2{(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;11,2&#8208;(SePh)2&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;P3)}][OTf] (8) is obtained.

         <title>Impact of Endcap Molecules on Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Oligomers in Structural Color Stability and Hypsochromic Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;responsive structurally colored coatings are created using endcapped cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. Newly synthesized and commercially available endcapping molecules are employed to terminate the liquid crystal oligomers. The impact of the endcap molecules in the oligomers on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift was studied. Commercial endcapping molecules were found to produce unstable coatings, while the new endcapped molecules led to stable coatings with reversible thermochromic behavior, making them intriguing for advanced optical applications.







Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers are an interesting class of temperature responsive structurally colored materials. However, the role of endcap molecules in these oligomers is rather unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the role of endcap molecules on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift in temperature&#8208;responsive cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. First, new liquid crystal monoacrylate endcap molecules are synthesized, which are then used to synthesize various cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. In addition, cholesteric oligomers using commercial monoacrylate endcap molecules are also prepared. It is found that the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the oligomers can be tuned by the endcapping molecules. The oligomers are used to produce reflective, structurally colored coatings. It was found that the coatings using the commercial monoacrylate lose their color and crystallize over time, most likely due to the presence of crystalline dimers. The coatings containing the newly synthesized monoacrylate endcap molecules did not exhibit this crystallization, resulting in structurally colored coatings that remained stable over time. These latter coatings possessed temperature responsive hypochromic behavior, which makes them interesting for advanced optical applications.

         <title>Osme Bond: Geometric and Energetic Features in the Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adducts formed by OsO4 and Lewis bases, have already been rationalised as &#963;&#8208;hole based adducts. The interaction involving Osmium as electrophilic site is named Osme Bond (Omb). Here, new adducts with OmB interaction were characterized. Computations confirm a strong correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and geometric deformation of OsO4.







Abstract
Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis bases exert a role in important oxidation processes such as epoxidation and dihydroxylation. It has been shown that the attractive interaction driving the formation of these adducts is a &#963;&#8208;hole bond involving the metal as the electrophilic species; the term Osme Bond (OmB) was proposed for designating it. Here some new adducts between OsO4 and various bases have been characterized through single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational studies (density functional theory, DFT), confirming the existence of a robust correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and deformation of the tetrahedral geometry of OsO4. Also, some adducts formed by RuO4 with nucleophiles were investigated computationally.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxypyrroloindoline Affords Tryptathionine and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;Indole Peptide Staples: Application to Melanotan&#8208;II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optionality for Indole&#8208;based Peptide Stapling: hydroxypyrroloindoline, used regularly in reaction with cysteine to form a tryptathionine (Ttn) staple is found to react competitively with an indole to form a 2&#8217;2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole tether (BITe). Judicious choice of protecting groups provides for chemoselectivity for optionality in terms of which staple is formed. Both staples are featured on a melanocortin peptide macrocycle and show nanomolar dissociation constants.







Abstract
With peptides increasingly favored as drugs, natural product motifs, namely the tryptathionine staple, found in amatoxins and phallotoxins, and the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole found in staurosporine represent unexplored staples for unnatural peptide macrocycles. We disclose the efficient condensation of a 5&#8208;hydroxypyrroloindoline with either a cysteine&#8208;thiol or a tryptophan&#8208;indole to form a tryptathionine or 2&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole staple. Judicious use of protecting groups provides for chemoselective stapling using &#945;&#8208;MSH, which provides a basis for investigating both chemoselectivity and affinity. Both classes of stapled peptides show nanomolar Ki&#8217;s, with one showing a sub&#8208;nanomolar Ki value.

         <title>Structural insights into the semiquinone form of human Cytochrome P450 reductase by DEER distance measurements between a native flavin and a spin labelled non&#8208;canonical amino acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring dynamics is crucial for understanding Cytochrome P450 Reductase's electron transfer pathway. We innovatively studied its one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced state using non&#8208;canonical amino acid and a semi&#8208;reduced flavin. This novel approach enabled distance measurement by Double Electron Electron Resonance on this specific redox state for the first time. Together with Molecular Dynamics studies, we showed the existence of an ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; state of the protein.







Abstract
The flavoprotein Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is the unique electron pathway from NADPH to Cytochrome P450 (CYPs). The conformational dynamics of human CPR in solution, which involves transitions from a &#8220;locked/closed&#8221; to an &#8220;unlocked/open&#8221; state, is crucial for electron transfer. To date, however, the factors guiding these changes remain unknown. By Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling coupled to Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we have incorporated a non&#8208;canonical amino acid onto the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domains of soluble human CPR, and labelled it with a specific nitroxide spin probe. Taking advantage of the endogenous FMN cofactor, we successfully measured for the first time, the distance distribution by DEER between the semiquinone state FMNH&#8226; and the nitroxide. The DEER data revealed a salt concentration&#8208;dependent distance distribution, evidence of an &#8220;open&#8221; CPR conformation at high salt concentrations exceeding previous reports. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations which unveiled a diverse ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; semiquinone state of the CPR at high salt concentration. This study unravels the conformational landscape of the one electron reduced state of CPR, which had never been studied before.

         <title>Reversible Restrain and Release of the Dynamic Valence Isomerization in a Shape&#8208;shifting Bullvalene by Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic valence isomerism of a bullvalene unit is tamed in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 chelate complex with Ag+, such that the bullvalene unit in the chelating ligand contains one predominant isomer at 5&#8201;&#176;C. In turn, in this completely reversible process, displacement of Ag+ from the complex with hexacyclene unleashes the dynamic interconversions of the bullvalene.







Abstract
In search for structural features that enable the control of the valence isomerization of the fluxional bullvalene, a bullvalene&#8208;bis(harmane) conjugate is identified that acts as chelating ligand in complexes with metal ions. Spectrometric titrations show that this ligand forms 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with Ag+, Cu+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. Most importantly, detailed NMR&#8208;spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures reveals that the complexation with Ag+ strongly affects the dynamic isomerization of the bullvalene unit of the ligand such that only one predominant valence isomer is formed, even at 5&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed 1H&#8208;NMR&#8208;spectroscopic studies disclose an increased barrier (~11&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) of the Cope rearrangement. Furthermore, the addition of hexacyclene displaces the Ag+ from the complex, so that the valence isomerization is accelerated and an equilibrium with two predominant isomers is formed. In turn, repeated addition of Ag+ regains the complex with the restrained isomerization of the bullvalene unit. This method to control the valence isomerism by straightforward chemical stimuli may be used to simplify structural analysis at elevated temperatures, i.&#8201;e. a feature not available so far with bullvalenes, and it may be employed as functional element in dynamic supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Oxidation of Unprotected Aminoglycosides and Sugar Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of amino groups and phosphates in aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates allows direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation without the use of protecting groups. The site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin allowed the preparation of a set of 3&#8217;&#8208;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two show promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of complex biomolecules by transition metal&#8208;catalysis is highly warranted, but often thwarted by the presence of Lewis basic functional groups. This study demonstrates that protonation of amines and phosphates in carbohydrates circumvents catalyst inhibition in palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation. Both aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates, compound classes that up till now largely escaped direct modification, are oxidized with good efficiency. Site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin was used to prepare a set of 3&#8217;&#8208;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two showed promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Central ring puckering of xanthene dyes leads to a substantial increase of their Stokes shift. This puckering can be induced in xanthene dyes by introducing sp3 hybridized bridging groups into their scaffold. The Stokes shift can be fine&#8208;tuned by the steric hindrance of the bridging group. Herein, we introduce this concept as a novel general strategy for fluorescent dyes design.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule dyes are generally designed based on well&#8208;understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum&#8208;chemical approach, we screened a group of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to ~2000&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to ~8700&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering&#8208;enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Induced Oligomerization of Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Phenylazothiazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometry of the molecules plays important role in various chemical and physical properties. Photoswitches are molecules that undergo structural changes from a stable isomer (trans) to a geometrically different less stable structure (cis) by light irradiation through isomerization. Here an unconventional phenomenon is reported where a cis isomer undergo oligomerization in the absence of light, however, behave as typical photoswitches in the presence of light irradiation.







Abstract
Photoswitches are molecules that can absorb light of specific wavelengths and undergo a reversible transformation between their trans and cis isomeric forms. In phenylazo photoswitches, it is common for the less stable cis (Z) isomer to convert back to the more stable trans (E) isomer either through photochemical or thermal means. In this research, we designed new derivatives of phenylazothiazole (PAT) photoswitches, PAT&#8208;Fn, which feature fluorine substituents on their phenyl component. These derivatives can reversibly isomerize under visible light exposure with the enrichment of E and Z isomers at photostationary state (PSS). Surprisingly, we observed an unconventional phenomenon when these PAT&#8208;Fn (n&#8807;2) photoswitches were in their cis isomeric state in the absence of light. Instead of the anticipated transformation from cis to trans isomer, these compounds converted to an oligomeric compound. Our detailed experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, indicated the crucial role of fluorine substituents and the distinctive geometric arrangement of the cis isomer in driving the unexpected oligomerization process originating from the cis isomeric state.

         <title>Understanding the Chemical Bond in Semiconductor/MXene Composites: TiO2 Clusters Anchored on the Ti2C MXene Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of composites involving TiO2 nanoparticles supported on the Ti2C MXene is investigated by means first&#8208;principles calculations. The analysis of the structural, bonding, and electronic properties confirms the stability of these composites which may have implication in catalysis. The stability of the composites arises favorable interaction between the two components, involving significant charge transfer from the MXene surface to the (TiO2)n (n=5,10) clusters. The present findings provide a reference that can be useful in the design of these composites.







Abstract
First&#8208;principles calculations on titania clusters (TiO2)n (n=5 and 10) supported on the pristine Ti2C (0001) surface were carried out to understand the properties of semiconductor/MXene composites with implications in (photo)&#8208;catalysis. The reported results reveal a high exothermic interaction accompanied by a substantial charge transfer with a concomitant, notorious, deformation of the titania nanoclusters. The analysis of the density of states analysis of the composite systems evidences a metallic character with titania related states crossing the Fermi level. The picture of the chemical bonds is completed by the analysis of X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) features, evidencing clear shifts of the C(1s) and O(1s) related peaks relative to the isolated systems that have a quite complex origin. This detailed analysis provides insights to experimentalists interested in the design and synthesis of these systems with possible applications in catalysis.

B, O&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;extended helical nanographene has been explored for its optical and chiroptical properties. The presence of helical and nanographene segments stabilize the helicity and imparts tunable optical properties. Helical nanographene display circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Helical nanographenes have garnered substantial attention owing to their finely adjustable optical and semiconducting properties. The strategic integration of both helicity and heteroatoms into the nanographene structure, facilitated by a boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;based multiple resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), elevates its photophysical and chiroptical features. This signifies the introduction of an elegant category of helical nanographene that combines optical (TADF) and chiroptical (CPL) features. In this direction, we report the synthesis, optical, and chiroptical properties of boron, oxygen&#8208;doped &#928;&#8208;extended helical nanographene. The &#960;&#8208;extension induces distortion in the DOBNA&#8208;incorporated nanographene, endowing a pair of helicenes, (P)&#8208;B2NG, and (M)&#8208;B2NG exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with glum of &#8722;2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and +2.5&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. B2NG exhibited MR&#8208;TADF with a lifetime below 5 &#956;s, and a reasonably high fluorescence quantum yield (50&#8201;%). Our molecular design enriches the optical and chiroptical properties of nanographenes and opens up new opportunities in multidisciplinary fields.

The reaction of rhodium enalcarbenoids with &#945;&#8208;amino ketones has led to the discovery of chemodivergent [3+3] annulations. Acyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones reacted via a protic ammonium ylide resulting in 1,2&#8208;dihydropridines (1,2&#8208;DHPs). In contrast, cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminoketones gave fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines via a vinylogous protic ammonium ylide due to a topology&#8208;driven regioselectivity switch. The 1,2&#8208;DHP and 1,4&#8208;oxazine products serve as precursors to diverse N&#8208;heterocycles. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;K. Mandal and S.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reaction of rhodium enalcarbenoids&lt;/b&gt; with &#945;-amino ketones has led to the discovery of chemodivergent [3+3] annulations. Acyclic &#945;-amino ketones reacted via a protic ammonium ylide resulting in 1,2-dihydropridines (1,2-DHPs). In contrast, cyclic &#945;-aminoketones gave fused 1,4-oxazines via a vinylogous protic ammonium ylide due to a topology-driven regioselectivity switch. The 1,2-DHP and 1,4-oxazine products serve as precursors to diverse N-heterocycles. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;K. Mandal and S.

Development of high energy density and high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB) to meet the growing energy demand is needed. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have proven to be both safe and effective alternative to commercial graphite anode materials. This review summarizes the recent development of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for LIBs, including developments in Nb2O5 materials, ternary niobium&#8208;based oxides, composites with carbon&#8208;based materials, as well as future directions and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.







Abstract
Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.

This review explores Carbon Dots (CDs) in cancer treatment, highlighting their synthesis, bioimaging applications, and role in drug delivery. The review details potential barriers to drug delivery, and details recent studies and developments, with a focus on the use of CDs as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems designed for the delivery of doxorubicin.







Abstract
Cancer, responsible for approximately 10 million lives annually, urgently requires innovative treatments, as well as solutions to mitigate the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, such as long&#8208;term adverse side effects and multidrug resistance. This review focuses on Carbon Dots (CDs), an emergent class of nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable physicochemical and biological properties, and their burgeoning applications in bioimaging and as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. The review initiates with an overview of NPs as nanocarriers, followed by an in&#8208;depth look into the biological barriers that could affect their distribution, from barriers to administration, to intracellular trafficking. It further explores CDs&#8242; synthesis, including both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches, and their notable biocompatibility, supported by a selection of in&#8197;vitro, in&#8197;vivo, and ex vivo studies. Special attention is given to CDs&#8242; role in bioimaging, highlighting their optical properties. The discussion extends to their emerging significance as drug carriers, particularly in the delivery of doxorubicin and other anticancer agents, underscoring recent advancements and challenges in this field. Finally, we showcase examples of other promising bioapplications of CDs, emergent owing to the NPs flexible design. As research on CDs evolves, we envisage key challenges, as well as the potential of CD&#8208;based systems in bioimaging and cancer therapy.

In this perspective paper, we discuss the working principle of plasma and its applied research on battery materials based on plasma conversion, deposition, etching, doping, etc. Furthermore, the new application directions of multiphase plasma associated with solid, liquid and gas sources are proposed and their application examples for batteries are given. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends of plasma technology are briefly summarized to provide guidance for the next generation of energy technologies.







Abstract
&#8220;Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality&#8221; is an important strategic goal for the sustainable development of human society. Typically, a key means to achieve these goals is through electrochemical energy storage technologies and materials. In this context, the rational synthesis and modification of battery materials through new technologies play critical roles. Plasma technology, based on the principles of free radical chemistry, is considered a promising alternative for the construction of advanced battery materials due to its inherent advantages such as superior versatility, high reactivity, excellent conformal properties, low consumption and environmental friendliness. In this perspective paper, we discuss the working principle of plasma and its applied research on battery materials based on plasma conversion, deposition, etching, doping, etc. Furthermore, the new application directions of multiphase plasma associated with solid, liquid and gas sources are proposed and their application examples for batteries (e.&#8201;g. lithium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, zinc&#8208;air batteries) are given. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends of plasma technology are briefly summarized to provide guidance for the next generation of energy technologies.

In this review, the impact of the transition from today's resource&#8208;wasting petrochemical economy towards a 100/100 renewable and biodegradable future is discussed with respect to the fragrance families: &#8220;citrus&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;fruity&#8221;, &#8220;floral&#8221;, &#8220;floriental&#8221;, &#8220;oriental&#8221;, &#8220;woody&#8221;, &#8220;chypre&#8221; and &#8220;foug&#232;re&#8221;. After benchmark data on ingredients usage, definitions on biodegradation and sustainability are given. Celebrating the 150th anniversary of synthetic vanillin, its historic synthesis from renewable starting materials serves as introduction. In the grand scheme of things, citrus scents upcycled from the beverages industry, are already an ideal case for 100/100 with new opportunities for artificial essential oils. In the fruity domain, transparent and lactonic ingredients are available in a sustainable manner. However, in the domain of green odorants, there is a lack of green chemistry for important key materials. In the floral family, renewability is more critical than biodegradability, but cost is an issue. Thanks to Ambrox and maltol, florientals and orientals will persist, while woody notes severely lack an Iso E Super replacer. In the chypre genre, patchouli became the new moss, but more musks are increasingly in demand. With their high percentage of linalool and dihydromyrcenol, the construction of foug&#232;res could well become a precedent for other families, despite challenges in vetiver and salicylates. Still, the challenges exemplified here create immense opportunities for new perfumery materials.

         <title>Synthesis of &#8216;Impossible&#8217; Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 19, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes turns out to be challenging, since their components do not have mutual recognition sites, thus complicating the assembly of the interlocked arrangement. This review highlights the importance of the development of novel synthetic strategies towards &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes by pointing out selected examples.







Abstract
&#8216;Impossible&#8217; rotaxanes, which are constituted by interlocked components without obvious binding motifs, have attracted the interest of the mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) community. Within the synthetic efforts reported in the last decades towards the preparation of MIMs, some innovative protocols for accessing &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes have been developed. This short review highlights different selected synthetic examples of &#8216;impossible&#8217; rotaxanes, as well as suggests some future directions of this research area.

         <title>Leveraging Pyrazolium Ylide Reactivity to Access Indolizine and 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, transition metal&#8208;free method to synthesize indolizines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidines from pyrazolium ylides is presented. The reaction of pyrazolium ylides with alkynes follows an N&#8208;deletion mechanism to afford indolizines, while reaction with isocyanates follows a rearrangement into a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidine.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic ylides are important synthetic precursors to rapidly build molecular complexity. Pyrazolium ylides have largely been unexplored, and we demonstrate their diverse utility in this report. We show that these readily accessible building blocks can be used to construct different heterocyclic skeletons by varying the coupling partner. Indolizines can be formed via an N&#8208;deletion type mechanism when reacting pyrazolium salts with electron deficient alkynes. 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidines can be formed via a rearrangement mechanism when reacting pyrazolium ylides with isocyanates. These reactions enable access to valuable heteroarenes without the need for transition metal catalysis, high temperatures, or strong bases.

         <title>Design of New Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane&#8208;Based Nitrogen Ligands: Synthesis and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new alcohol neutral ligand precursors based on bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane moieties is reported. A substrate&#8208;dependent functionalization is observed allowing access to a variety of ligand precursors. The coordination chemistry of some of them against aluminum and zinc have also been investigated.







Abstract
The reaction between bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane derivatives and nBuLi and various aldehydes, yielded novel neutral ligand precursors incorporating alcohol functional groups. The resulting compounds exhibited distinct characteristics depending on the steric hindrance of the aldehyde employed. In instances where aromatic aldehydes were utilized, functionalization occurred at the methine group bridging both triazole rings. Conversely, the use of pivalic aldehyde prompted functionalization at the C5 position of the triazole ring. These compounds were subsequently employed as ligand precursors in the synthesis of organometallic aluminum and zinc complexes, yielding dinuclear complexes with high efficiency. The structural elucidation of all compounds was accomplished through spectroscopic methods and validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Preliminary catalytic investigations into the coupling reaction of cyclohexene oxide and CO2 revealed that aluminum and zinc complexes catalyzed the selective formation of polyether and polycarbonate materials, respectively.

         <title>Amino&#8208; and Alkoxybenziodoxoles: Facile Preparation and Use as Arynophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diverse array of amino&#8208; and alkoxybenziodoxoles can be easily synthesized by reacting the respective amines and alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole. These iodane compounds undergo insertion of arynes into the N&#8722;I(III) and O&#8722;I(III) bonds to give ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, the iodane group of which can be leveraged as a versatile leaving group for downstream transformations.







Abstract
We report here on the facile synthesis of amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes supported by a benziodoxole (BX) template and their use as arynophiles. The amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX derivatives can be readily synthesized by reacting the respective amines or alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole in the presence of a suitable base. Unlike previously known nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;bound iodane compounds, which have primarily been employed as electrophilic group transfer agents or oxidants, the present amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX reagents manifest themselves as nucleophilic amino and alkoxy transfer agents toward arynes. This reactivity leads to the aryne insertion into the N&#8722;I(III) or O&#8722;I(III) bond to afford ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, iodane compounds nontrivial to procure by existing methods. The BX group in these insertion products exhibits excellent leaving group ability, enabling diverse downstream transformations.

A stereoselective intramolecular bicyclization reaction of sulfonamides via intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade which is an efficient, simple and practical method for the synthesis of bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams.







Abstract
A novel approach has been developed for the synthesis of bicyclic &#946;, &#947;&#8208;fused bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams containing two consecutive chiral centers through an intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade of alkenyl sulfamides. The straightforward practical procedure and readily available starting materials enable the synthesis of variously substituted ureasultams. In addition, bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams is a class of potential biotin analogues.

         <title>Endowing Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Materials with Chiroptical Activity by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the chirality transfer from chiral anions to cationic coordination components, efficient circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence properties are realized. Such a chiral anion strategy is successfully implemented in ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The chiroptical properties can be modulated by the use of different chiral anions.







Abstract
Recently, chiral metal&#8208;organic coordination materials have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of applications in chiroptoelectronics, chiral catalysis, and information encryption, etc. Notably, the chiroptical effect of coordination chromophores makes them appealing for applications such as photodetectors, OLEDs, 3D displays, and bioimaging. The direct synthesis of chiral coordination materials using chiral organic ligands or complexes with metal&#8208;centered chirality is very often tedious and costly. In the case of ionic coordination materials, the combination of chiral anions with cationic, achiral coordination compounds through noncovalent interactions may endow molecular materials with desirable chiroptical properties. The use of such a simple chiral strategy has been proven effective in inducing promising circular dichroism and/or circularly polarized luminescence signals. This concept article mainly delves into the latest advances in exploring the efficacy of such a chiral anion strategy for transforming achiral coordination materials into chromophores with superb photo&#8208; or electro&#8208;chiroptical properties. In particular, ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks containing chiral anions are discussed. A perspective on the future opportunities on the preparation of chiroptical materials with the chiral anion strategy is also presented.

         <title>A GFP Inspired 8&#8208;Methoxyquinoline&#8211;Derived Fluorescent Molecular Sensor for the Detection of Zn2+ by Two&#8211;Photon Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New zinc sensor with 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety inspired by the green fluorescent protein chromophore was synthesized and characterized. The in&#8197;vitro validation of the novel probe with two&#8211;photon microscopy was carried out successfully.







Abstract
An effective, GFP&#8208;inspired fluorescent Zn2+ sensor is developed for two&#8211;photon microscopy and related biological application that features an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety. Excellent photophysical characteristics including a 37&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with excitation and emission maxima at 440&#8197;nm and 505&#8197;nm, respectively, as well as a high two&#8211;photon cross&#8211;section of 73&#8197;GM at 880&#8197;nm are reported. Based on the experimental data, the relationship between the structure and properties was elucidated and explained backed up by DFT calculations, particularly the observed PeT phenomenon for the turn&#8211;on process. Biological validation and detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the free and the zinc&#8211;bound compounds are presented.

         <title>Unraveling Polymorphism Dependent Cytotoxicity, Cellular Uptake, and Live Cell Imaging Using Luminescent Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphism&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of drug molecules have been studied for the past two decades. However, visualizing the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using microscopy imaging technique has not been reported yet. The luminescent polymorph is an ideal candidate to validate the above hypothesis. Herein, we report the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and bio&#8208;imaging functions of polymorphs 1Y and 1R of a naphthalimide&#8208;phenothiazine dyad. These polymorphs show different luminescence colors in the solid state and exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in the DMSO&#8208;Water mixture. Bioimaging, cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) studies revealed that these polymorphs show different levels of cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, localization, and imaging potential. Detailed photophysical, morphological, and biological studies revealed that the difference in molecular conformation in these polymorphs enables them to form aggregates of different sizes and morphology, which leads to the differential uptake of these into the cells and consequently shows different cytotoxicity and imaging potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination of a Phosphine&#8208;Tethered Aminoborane to Group 10 Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While &#960;&#8208;complexes of C=C bonds are ubiquitous in organometallic chemistry, analogous complexes of the isoelectronic but strongly polarized B=N double bond of aminoboranes are extremely scarce. To address this gap, a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand (PhDPBAiPr) is introduced and its coordination with group 10 metals is investigated. The B=N bond does not coordinate to the metal in Pt(0) and Pd(II) complexes. In contrast, side&#8208;on coordination of the B=N bond is observed in the Ni(0) complex [PhDPBAiPr]Ni(NCPh), and the X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals B&#8212;N bond elongation compared to the free ligand. The choice of co&#8208;ligand strongly influences the presence or absence of side&#8208;on coordination at Ni(0) as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. While the B=N &#960;&#8208;complex is geometrically similar to C=C analogues, a bonding analysis reveals that the interaction of the B=N motif with the electron&#8208;rich Ni(0) center is best described as 3c4e hyperbond, in which Ni and N are competing for the empty orbital on B.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Kinetic Pathways toward Supramolecular Chiral Polymorphs for Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 bearing two chiral hydrophilic side chains with S&#8208;stereogenic centers was synthesized. This dye exhibited kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H2O (9/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The (S)&#8208;1 monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off&#8208;pathway species Agg. A, which was spontaneously transformed into an on&#8208;pathway metastable aggregate (Agg. B) and subsequently into the thermodynamic Agg. C. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (S)&#8208;1 displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J&#8208;aggregation characteristics were observed for both Agg. B and Agg. C, such as Davydov&#8208;split absorption bands (Agg. B), extremely sharp and intense J&#8208;band with large bathochromic shift (Agg. C), non&#8208;diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that Agg. A had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod&#8208;like helical nanostructures with left&#8208;handedness were observed respectively for Agg. B and Agg. C. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C, thin films consisting of Agg. B and Agg. C with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788 &#8208; 805 nm and g&#8211;factors between &#8211;4.2 &#215; 10&#8211;2 and &#8211;5.1 &#215; 10&#8211;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials for Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising resutls in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle&#8208;based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle&#8208;based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Optically active poly(naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) was prepared through helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective polymerization of the corresponding monomers and also through circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation, resulting in distinctive circular dichroism (CD) spectral patterns. Chirality of the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective polymerization &#8208;based polymer is ascribed to preferred&#8208;handed helicity while that of the CPL&#8208;based polymer to a non&#8208;helical, chiral conformation (&#8216;biased&#8208;dihedral conformation&#8217;) with preferred&#8208;handedness which was stable only in the solid state. The helix of the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective polymerization&#8208;based polymer gradually racemized in tetrahydrofuran while it was stabilized by aggregate formation in a hexane&#8208;dichloromethane solution. Both helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective polymerization&#8208; and CPL&#8208;based polymers exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of Design Criteria for V&#8208;based Redox Mediators: Structure&#8208;Function Relationships that Dictate Rates of Heterogeneous Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox mediators are attractive solutions for addressing the stringent kinetic stipulations required for efficient energy conversion processes. In this work, we compare the electrochemical properties of four vanadium complexes, namely [V(acac)3], [V6O7(OMe)12], [nBu4N]3[V6O13(TRISNO2)2], and [nBu4N]5[V18O46(NO3)] in non&#8208;aqueous solutions on glassy carbon electrodes. The goal of this study is to investigate the electron transfer kinetics and diffusivity of these compounds under identical experimental conditions to develop an understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships that dictate the physicochemical properties of vanadium oxide assemblies. Complex selection was dictated by two criteria &#8211; (1) nuclearity of the transition metal complexes (2) distribution of electron density in the native electronic configuration. Our analyses establish that electronic communication between metal centers significantly impacts charge transfer kinetics of these vanadium&#8208;based compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes as Anticancer Drug Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Chemotherapy remains one of the most dominant forms for anticancer treatment. Despite their clinical success, the used chemotherapeutic agents are associated with severe side effect and pharmacological limitations. To overcome these drawbacks there is a need for the development of new types of chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are proposed. The metal complexes were found to be internalized by an energy dependent endocytosis pathway, primary accumulating in the mitochondria. The rhenium(I) complexes demonstrated to induce cell death against a variety of cancer cells in the micromolar range through apoptosis. The lead compound showed to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid at micromolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation Strategies on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and alkaline membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have received great attention as the energy device of next generation. Accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics is the key to improve PEMFCs and AEMFCs performance. Platinum&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used catalysts for ORR, but their high price and low abundance limit the commercialization of fuel cell. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) is considered to be the most likely material to replace Pt&#8208;based catalysts, among which Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic ORR performance and have made great progress in the past decades. With the improvement of synthesis technology and deepening understanding of the ORR mechanism, some reported Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts have shown excellent ORR activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Inspired by the progress, regulation strategies on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C or Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts are summarized in this review from 5 aspects: (1) coordinated atoms, (2) environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3) dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4) metal&#8208;based particle promoter and (5) curved carbon layer. Next, we make our own suggestions on some challenges facing Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C research.</dc:description>

         <title>Superalkalis with Hydrogen as Central Electronegative Atom and their Possible Applications: Ab Initio and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superalkalis having hydrogen as central electronegative core are designed. They exhibit very low ionization energies even lower than that of cesium. The superalkalis are capable of reducing molecules having very low electron affinities. They can act as the building blocks of supersalts and also show remarkable non&#8208;linear optical property.







Abstract
Superalkalis are unusual species having ionization energies lower than that of the alkali metals. These species with various applications are of great importance in chemistry due to their low ionization energies and strong reducing property. A typical superalkali contains a central electronegative core decorated with excess metal ligands. In the quest for novel superalkalis, we have designed the superalkalis HLi2, HLiNa and HNa2 using hydrogen as central electronegative atom for the first time employing high level ab initio (CCSD(T), MP2) and density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) methods. The superalkalis exhibit very low ionization energies, even lower than that of cesium. Stability of these species is verified from binding energy and dissociation energy values. The superalkalis are capable of reducing SO2, NO, CO2, CO and N2 molecules by forming stable ionic complexes and therefore can be used as catalysts for the reduction or activation of systems possessing very low electron affinities. The superalkalis form stable supersalts with tailored properties when interact with a superhalogen. They also show remarkably high non&#8208;linear optical responses, hence could have industrial applications. It is hoped that this work will enrich the superalkali family and spur further theoretical and experimental research in this direction.

         <title>Roles of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Functional Groups in Carbon for Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) are crucial in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction which enables the flexible synthesis of H2O2. Herein, the construction strategies and the specific roles of OFGs are reviewed, aiming to provide inspirations for the future development of advanced carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed great research interests in developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that enables the sustainable and flexible synthesis of H2O2. Carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts exhibit attractive catalytic performance for the 2e&#8722; ORR, where oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) play a decisive role. However, current understanding is far from adequate, and the contribution of OFGs to the catalytic performance remains controversial. Therefore, a critical overview on OFGs in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR is highly desirable. Herein, we go over the methods for constructing OFGs in carbon including chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, and precursor inheritance. Then we review the roles of OFGs in activating carbon toward the 2e&#8722; ORR, focusing on the intrinsic activity of different OFGs and the interplay between OFGs and metal species or defects. At last, we discuss the reasons for inconsistencies among different studies, and personal perspectives on the future development in this field are provided. The results provide insights into the origin of high catalytic activity and selectivity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR and would provide theoretical foundations for the future development in this field.

         <title>Suppressing Cis/Trans &#8216;Ring&#8208;Flipping&#8217; in Organoaluminium(III)&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridyl Dimers&#8211;Design Strategies Towards Lewis Acid Catalysts for Alkene Oligomerisation</title>

Controlling the cis/trans isomerism of the dimers [R2Al(&#956;&#8208;2&#8208;py&#8217;)]2 is the key to the development of co&#8208;operative cationic Al(III) catalysts that may offer stereo&#8208;control of alkene insertion during polymerization, in a similar way to established Zr(IV)&#8208;based systems. Substitution at the 6&#8208;position of the 2&#8208;py&#8217; groups favors the desired C2&#8208;symmetric trans isomer and the stability of the cations [{RAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ formed by demethylation.







Abstract
Owing to its high natural abundance compared to the commonly used transition (precious) metals, as well as its high Lewis acidity and ability to change oxidation state, aluminium has recently been explored as the basis for a range of single&#8208;site catalysts. This paper aims to establish the ground rules for the development of a new type of cationic alkene oligomerisation catalyst containing two Al(III) ions, with the potential to act co&#8208;operatively in stereoselective assembly. Five new dimers of the type [R2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 (R=Me, iBu; py&#8242;=substituted pyridyl group) with different substituents on the Al atoms and pyridyl rings have been synthesised. The formation of the undesired cis isomers can be suppressed by the presence of substituents on the 6&#8208;position of the pyridyl ring due to steric congestion, with DFT calculations showing that the selection of the trans isomer is thermodynamically controlled. Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 with Ph3C+ to the cations [{MeAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ is highly favourable and that the desired trans disposition of the 2&#8208;pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects. Preliminary experimental studies confirm that demethylation of [Me2Al(6&#8208;MeO&#8208;2&#8208;py)]2 can be achieved using [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4].

         <title>Selective Mono&#8208;Defluorinative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Trifluoromethyl arenes via Multiphoton Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. A series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds can be generated while the the addition of D2O leads to highly deuterated derivatives.







Abstract
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. Trifluoromethyl arenes were demonstrated to undergo selective mono&#8208;defluorinative alkylation under mild reaction conditions providing access to a series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and general functional group tolerance. In addition to the electron&#8208;deficient trifluoromethyl arenes that are easily reduced to the corresponding radical anion, more challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates were also successfully applied. Steady&#8208;State Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching studies indicated that the trifluoromethyl arenes were reduced by the multiphoton excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>Anilato&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers with Slow Relaxation of the Magnetization: Role of the Synthetic Method and Anilato Ligand</title>

The anilato&#8208;based DyIII&#8208;containing compounds formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with X=Br (2) and Cl (3), prepared with formamide as coordinating solvent, are coordination polymers with a honey&#8208;comb layered structure showing slow magnetic relaxation when a DC field is applied. Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with a slow and fast crystallization method, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural.







Abstract
We have prepared and characterized three coordination polymers formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with X=Br (2) and Cl (3), where fma=formamide and C6O4X22&#8722;=3,6&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone dianion with X=Cl (chloranilato) and Br (bromanilato). Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with slow and fast precipitation methods, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural and only differ in the X group of the anilato ligand. The three compounds present (6,3)&#8208;gon two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal honey&#8208;comb structures. Magnetic measurements indicate that the three compounds show slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures when a continuous magnetic field is applied, although with different relaxation times and energy barriers depending on X and the crystallisation molecules.

&lt;p&gt;We have prepared and characterized three coordination polymers formulated as [Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(fma)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(fma)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with X=Br (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and Cl (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), where fma=formamide and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=3,6-disubstituted-2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone dianion with X=Cl (chloranilato) and Br (bromanilato). Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are solvates obtained with slow and fast precipitation methods, respectively. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are isostructural and only differ in the X group of the anilato ligand. The three compounds present (6,3)-gon two-dimensional hexagonal honey-comb structures. Magnetic measurements indicate that the three compounds show slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures when a continuous magnetic field is applied, although with different relaxation times and energy barriers depending on X and the crystallisation molecules. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; represent the first examples of anilato-based lattices with formamide and field-induced slow relaxation of the magnetization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;Emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous evaluation of the catalytic activity of anode and cathode materials present in water electrolyzers is made possible by combining bipolar electrochemistry with an optical readout based on light&#8208;emitting diodes. The straightforward strategy is an alternative to classic physico&#8208;chemical characterization techniques and can be applied beyond water splitting.







Abstract
Water splitting has become a sustainable and clean alternative for hydrogen production. Commonly, the efficiency of such reactions is intimately related to the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the catalysts that constitute the electrolyzer. Thus, the development of simple and fast methods to evaluate the electrocatalytic efficiency of an electrolyzer is highly required. In this work, we present an unconventional method based on the combination of bipolar electrochemistry and light&#8208;emitting diodes, which allows the evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance of the two types of catalysts, composing an electrolyzer, namely for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. The integrated light emission of the diode acts as an optical readout of the electrocatalytic information, which simultaneously depends on the composition of the anode and the cathode. The electrocatalytic activity of Au, Pt, and Ni electrodes, connected to the LED in multiple anode/cathode configurations, towards the water splitting reactions has been evaluated. The efficiency of the electrolyzer can be represented in terms of the onset electric field (&#1013;onset) for light emission, obtaining variations that are in agreement with data reported with conventional electrochemistry. This work introduces a straightforward method for evaluating electrocatalysts and underscores the importance of material characterization in developing efficient electrolyzers for hydrogen production.

         <title>Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts Acylation of [11C]Isocyanates Enabling the Radiolabeling of [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a radiolabeling method for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams using the PET nuclide carbon&#8208;11. The labeling reactions utilize widely available [11C]CO2 and amine precursors in a quick, robust and automatable one&#8208;pot reaction. The reaction showed a broad substrate scope and was applied to produce the otherwise inaccessible PARP inhibitor tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ, meeting the quality requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams are highly abundant in biologically active molecules, yet so far they cannot be radiolabeled with short&#8208;lived (t1/2=20.3&#8197;min), &#946;+&#8208;decaying carbon&#8208;11, which has prevented their application as positron emission tomography tracers. Herein, we developed, optimized, and applied a widely applicable, one&#8208;pot, quick, robust and automatable radiolabeling method for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams starting from [11C]CO2 using the reagent POCl3&#8901;AlCl3. This method proceeds via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of in&#8197;situ formed [11C]isocyanates and shows a broad substrate scope for the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings. We implemented our developed labeling method for the radiosynthesis of the potential PARP1 PET tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ in a clinical radiotracer production facility following the standards of the European Pharmacopoeia.

         <title>Incorporation of Carboxylate Pendant Arms into 18&#8208;Membered Macrocycles: Effects on [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelators based on an 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic unit form very stable Pb(II) complexes from the thermodynamic point of view. The studies performed with [203Pb]Pb(II) show that the fluxionality of the complexes is a key factor that needs to be considered for the development of Pb(II)&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) with chelators H4PYTA and H4CHX&#8208;PYTA. These chelators belong to the family of ligands derived from the 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone PYAN and present varying degrees of rigidity due to the presence of either ethyl or cyclohexyl spacers. A complete study of the stable Pb(II) complexes is carried out via NMR, X&#8208;Ray crystallography, stability constant determination and computational studies. While these studies indicated that Pb(II) complexation is achieved, and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting complexes is very high, a certain degree of fluxionality does exist in both cases. Nevertheless, radiolabeling studies were carried out using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) compatible isotope lead&#8208;203 (203Pb, t1/2=51.9&#8197;h), and while both chelators complex the radioisotope, the incorporation of carboxylate pendant arms appears to be detrimental towards the stability of the complexes when compared to the previously described amide analogues. Additionally, incorporation of a cyclohexyl spacer does not improve the kinetic inertness of the system.

         <title>[Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)]: Equilibrium, Dissociation Kinetic and Structural Differences in a Simple Homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (Prohance&#174;)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The minor structural variation arising in [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)] from homologation of a coordination side arm of the clinically employed MRI contrast agent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) does not influence its overall general structure but significantly affects its dynamic properties.







Abstract
[Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) as an active compound of ProHance&#174; is a widely employed contrast agent in clinical MRI scans in the last 30&#8197;years. Recent concerns about the long&#8208;term retention of gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) led to a deeper investigation of the structural features underlying the integrity of the paramagnetic metal complex. Several human and nonclinical studies have noted marked differences among the macrocyclic GBCAs, with the least retention of Gd traces and most rapid elimination consistently being reported for [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)]. It was deemed of interest to assess how minor structural/electronic changes associated to the ligand structure may affect basic properties of the metal complex with several [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] analogues synthesized and characterized in the last years. We recently reported that the closest homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)], i.&#8201;e.: [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], in which a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pendant arm is replaced by a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;butyl moiety, showed a significantly different retention behaviour in the model interaction with collagen, despite the apparently very minor structural difference. In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties of [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], compared to the parent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] and to other closely related macrocyclic GBCAs to assess whether very minor structural changes can modulate the physico&#8208;chemical properties of Gd3+ complexes.

&lt;p&gt;The minor structural variation arising in [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HB-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)] from homologation of a coordination side arm of the clinically employed MRI contrast agent [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HP-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)] (gadoteridol) does not influence its overall general structure but significantly affects its dynamic properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Gd(&lt;b&gt;HP-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)] (gadoteridol) as an active compound of ProHance&lt;sup&gt;&#174;&lt;/sup&gt; is a widely employed contrast agent in clinical MRI scans in the last 30&#8197;years. Recent concerns about the long-term retention of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) led to a deeper investigation of the structural features underlying the integrity of the paramagnetic metal complex. Several human and nonclinical studies have noted marked differences among the macrocyclic GBCAs, with the least retention of Gd traces and most rapid elimination consistently being reported for [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HP-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)]. It was deemed of interest to assess how minor structural/electronic changes associated to the ligand structure may affect basic properties of the metal complex with several [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HP-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)] analogues synthesized and characterized in the last years. We recently reported that the closest homolog of [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HP-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)], &lt;i&gt;i.&#8201;e&lt;/i&gt;.: [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HB-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)], in which a (&#177;)-2-hydroxy-1-propyl pendant arm is replaced by a (&#177;)-2-hydroxy-1-butyl moiety, showed a significantly different retention behaviour in the model interaction with collagen, despite the apparently very minor structural difference. In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties of [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HB-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)], compared to the parent [Gd(&lt;b&gt;HP-DO3A&lt;/b&gt;)] and to other closely related macrocyclic GBCAs to assess whether very minor structural changes can modulate the physico-chemical properties of Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A series of isostructural imidonitridophosphates AE2AlP8N15(NH) (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) was synthesized at high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature conditions (1400&#8201;&#176;C and 5&#8211;9&#160;GPa) from alkaline&#8208;earth metal nitrides or azides Ca3N2/Sr(N3)2/Ba(N3)2 and the binary nitrides AlN and P3N5. NH4F served as a hydrogen source and mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and feature a three&#8208;dimensional network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming diverse&#8208;sized rings that are occupied by aluminum and alkaline earth ions. These structures represent another example of nitridophosphate&#8208;based networks that simultaneously incorporate AlN6&#8208;octahedra and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;centered polyhedra, with aluminum not participating in the tetrahedra network. They differ from previously reported ones by incorporating non&#8208;condensed octahedra instead of strongly condensed octahedra units and contribute to the diversity of multicationic nitridophosphate network structures. The results are supported by atomic resolution EDX mapping, solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR measurements. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show strong luminescence with narrow emissions in the range of green to blue under UV excitation, marking another instance of Eu2+&#8208;luminescence within imidonitridophosphates.

         <title>Design of Bright Chemogenetic Reporters Based on the Combined Engineering of Fluorogenic Molecular Rotors and of the HaloTag Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of fluorogenic probes (fluorogens) and self&#8208;labeling protein tags represent a promising tool for imaging biological processes with high specificity but it requires the adequation between the fluorogen and its target to ensure a good activation of its fluorescence. In this work, we report a strategy to develop molecular rotors that specifically target HaloTag with a strong enhancement of their fluorescence. The divergent design facilitates the diversification of the structures to tune the photophysical and cellular properties. Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash&#8208;free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Chirality in Inorganic Crystals: from Construction to Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality represents a fundamental characteristic inherent in nature, playing a pivotal role in the emergence of homochirality and the origin of life. While the principles of chirality in organic chemistry are well&#8208;documented, the exploration of chirality within inorganic crystal structures continues to evolve. This ongoing development is primarily due to the diverse nature of crystal/amorphous structures in inorganic materials, along with the intricate symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships in the geometry of their constituent atoms. In this review, we commence with a summary of the foundational concept of chirality in molecules and solid states matters. This is followed by an introduction of structural chirality and electronic chirality in three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials. The construction of chirality in inorganic materials is classified into physical photolithography, wet&#8208;chemistry method, self&#8208;assembly, and chiral imprinting. Highlighting the significance of this field, we also summarize the research progress of chiral inorganic materials for applications in optical activity, enantiomeric recognition and chiral sensing, selective adsorption and enantioselective separation, asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, and chirality&#8208;induced spin polarization. This review aims to provide a reference for ongoing research in chiral inorganic materials and potentially stimulate innovative strategies and novel applications in the realm of chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene has been synthesized by the combination of decarbonylative borylation, iodination and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. The racemization energy barrier of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of isomeric 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl.







Abstract
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene is a potentially attractive key component of an axially chiral biaryl compound, however, its structure and properties have not been clarified owing to the lack of its efficient synthesis. We report a breakthrough in the reliable synthesis of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene, which is achieved by the access to azulen&#8208;4&#8208;ylboronic acid pinacol ester and 4&#8208;iodoazulene as novel key synthetic intermediates for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene confirmed its axial chirality. The enantiomers of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene were successfully resolved by HPLC on the chiral stationary phase column. The kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the racemization energy barrier of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl.

         <title>The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208;countercations for inorganic oxoanions are not innocent bystanders. The uranyl triperoxide anion, a monomer building block for uranyl&#8208;polyoxometalates, shows substantial decrease in stability with increasing alkali size, in solution and the solid state. The Cs uranyl triperoxide, stable for only minutes in air, undergoes stabilization by direct air capture of CO2.







Abstract
Spectator ions have known and emerging roles in aqueous metal&#8208;cation chemistry, respectively directing solubility, speciation, and reactivity. Here, we isolate and structurally characterize the last two metastable members of the alkali uranyl triperoxide series, the Rb+ and Cs+ salts (Cs&#8208;U1 and Rb&#8208;U1).

To understand the role of the alkalis, we also quantify alkali&#8208;hydroxide promoted peroxide deprotonation and decomposition, which generally exhibits increasing reactivity with increasing alkali size. Cs&#8208;U1, the most unstable of the uranyl triperoxide monomers, undergoes ambient direct air capture of CO2 in the solid&#8208;state, converting to Cs4[UVIO2(CO3)3], evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We have attempted to benchmark the evolution of Cs&#8208;U1 to uranyl tricarbonate, which involves a transient, unstable hygroscopic solid that contains predominantly pentavalent uranium, quantified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests this intermediate state contains a hydrous derivative of CsUVO3, where the parent phase has been computationally predicted, but not yet synthesized.

     alt="The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl-Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkali-countercations for inorganic oxoanions are not innocent bystanders. The uranyl triperoxide anion, a monomer building block for uranyl-polyoxometalates, shows substantial decrease in stability with increasing alkali size, in solution and the solid state. The Cs uranyl triperoxide, stable for only minutes in air, undergoes stabilization by direct air capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectator ions have known and emerging roles in aqueous metal-cation chemistry, respectively directing solubility, speciation, and reactivity. Here, we isolate and structurally characterize the last two metastable members of the alkali uranyl triperoxide series, the Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salts (Cs-&lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and Rb-&lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). We document their rapid solution polymerization via small-angle X-ray scattering, which is compared to the more stable Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; analogues. To understand the role of the alkalis, we also quantify alkali-hydroxide promoted peroxide deprotonation and decomposition, which generally exhibits increasing reactivity with increasing alkali size. Cs-&lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, the most unstable of the uranyl triperoxide monomers, undergoes ambient direct air capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the solid-state, converting to Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[U&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], evidenced by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We have attempted to benchmark the evolution of Cs-&lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; to uranyl tricarbonate, which involves a transient, unstable hygroscopic solid that contains predominantly pentavalent uranium, quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Powder X-ray diffraction suggests this intermediate state contains a hydrous derivative of CsU&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where the parent phase has been computationally predicted, but not yet synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential, electrochemical&#8208;photochemical synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine was prepared via a two&#8208;step electrochemical, photochemical process. First, a 5&#8208;substituted tetrazole is electrochemically coupled to 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine to yield 1,5&#8208; and 2,5&#8208; disubstituted tetrazoles. Subsequent photochemical excitation of the 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole species using an ultraviolet lamp releases nitrogen gas and produces a short&#8208;lived nitrilimine intermediate. Rapid cyclization of the nitrilimine intermediate yields a 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine backbone. The scope of this reaction was explored using various tetrazoles and pyrazines. Materials produced were identified using chemical analytical techniques and computationally studied for potential application as an insensitive energetic material.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Basic Ligands and Alkenes on the Regioselectivity of C&#8211;H  Additions of Tertiary Amines to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly regioselective C&#8210;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines and tertiary alkyl amines with simple alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium alkyl complexes. This protocol provided an efficient and  atom&#8208;economical route to structurally diverse tertiary amine derivatives. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates were found to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8210;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines presumably due to the generation of different types of catalytically active species or the formation of relatively stable intermediates. On the basis of the deuterium labeling experiments and KIE experiments, possible catalytical cycles were provided to understand the reaction mechanism as well as the regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Coordination Polymers: Impact of a Lead&#8211;Sulfur Network on Photoconductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8208;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties that originate from infinite M&#8211;S bond networks. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two polymorphs of a two&#8208;dimensional Pb(II) S&#8208;CP with a formula of [Pb(tzdt)(OAc)] (Htzdt = 1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, OAc = acetate). Our findings revealed that the thermodynamic product (KGF&#8208;26) possesses (&#8211;Pb&#8211;O&#8211;)n chains only, whereas the kinetic product (KGF&#8208;27) has both one&#8208;dimensional (&#8211;Pb&#8211;O&#8211;)n chains and two&#8208;dimensional (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n layers. The results of time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations confirmed that KGF&#8208;27 exhibits higher photoconductivity than KGF&#8208;26, which establishes that the inorganic (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks formed in S&#8208;CPs are crucial for achieving high photoconductivity. This is the first experimental demonstration of the impact of the (&#8211;M&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks in S&#8208;CPs on photoconductivity through the comparison of crystal polymorphisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Evolution and Immobilization of Lactobacillus brevis Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Chemo&#8208;enzymatic Synthesis of Rivastigmine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi&#8208;rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co&#8208;immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66%. This study offers an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;induced Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized&#160;Luminescence of Binaphthyl&#8208;bridged Tetrathiapyrenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes containing thioether bonds were synthesized. The pyrenophanes exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) while maintaining the emission wavelength and reversibility. The &#916;glum value reached 0.02, and the FL quenching by heat was negligible. The sign inversion of CPL originates from the inversion of intramolecular excimer chirality associated with excitation dynamics. The two pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures. The thioether linkers can impart flexibility suitable for the inversion of chirality of the excimers.</dc:description>

The influence of the complex glycan structures, which can present SLex&#160;epitopes, on binding is largely unknown. We report here a chemoenzymatic strategy for the preparation of a panel&#160;of twenty&#8208;two&#160;isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary&#160;N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex&#160;epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm&#160;that include putative high&#8208;affinity ligands for E&#8208;selectin. The&#160;N&#8208;glycans were prepared starting from&#160;a sialoglycopeptide isolated from egg yolk powder and&#160;took advantage of inherent substrate preferences of glycosyltransferases and the use of 5&#8242;&#8208;diphospho&#8208;N&#8208;trifluoracetylglucosamine (UDP&#8208;GlcNHTFA) that can be transferred by branching&#160;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferases to give, after base treatment,&#160;GlcNH2&#8208;containing glycans that temporarily disable an antenna from enzymatic modification.&#160;Glycan microarray binding studies showed that E&#8208;selectin bound equally well to linear glycans and tri&#8208;antennary&#160;N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex. On the other hand, it was found that hemagglutinins (HA) of H5 influenza A viruses (IAV) preferentially bound the tri&#8208;antennary&#160;N&#8208;glycans. Furthermore, several H5 HAs preferentially bound to&#160;N&#8208;glycan presenting SLex&#160;on the MGAT4 arm. SLex&#160;is displayed in the respiratory tract of several avian species, demonstrating the relevance of investigating the binding of, among others IAVs, to complex&#160;N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Spectroscopic Methods: Towards Chemical Sensor Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) are a rapidly growing field reflecting their potential as selective and sensitive chemical sensors for chiral analytes. The highly tuneable nature of CMOFs enables the size, shape, and non&#8208;covalent interactions to be optimised towards specific analytes to engender strong intermolecular interactions and sensing responses. While CMOFs as chiral chemical sensor devices have been explored with electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), bipolar and chemiresistive sensing techniques, the CMOFs as chiral chemical sensors using spectroscopic methods has received significantly less attention. This review examines the synthesis of CMOFs for chemical sensors with spectroscopic methods such as photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance with a view towards their incorporation into chemical sensor devices. Future directions of the field are highlighted for the generation of functional devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Lewis Acid Properties of Neutral Silver(III) Adducts Containing the AgIII(CF3)3 Moiety</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acetonitrile AgIII complex [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) has been reported independently by Eujen and Naumann in the last century, albeit with intriguing NMR discrepancy. In their reports, 2 was claimed to be obtained starting from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8211; (3.Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8211; (1) via halide abstraction using AgNO3 or acidic treatment, resp. These two synthetic routes are herein reinvestigated. The feasibility of Naumann&#8217;s method is demonstrated, thus providing 2 yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;). The formation of 2&#8217; is unprecedented and was thereby investigated. Both 2 and 2&#8217; were isolated in pure fashion and fully characterized. In turn, halide extraction from 3.Cl leads to the AgIII&#8208;ONO2 anion 5 instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, EA and Sc&#8208;XRD.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and (Photo)Catalytic Behavior of Ce&#8208;MOFs Containing Perfluoroalkylcarboxylate Linkers: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure.&#160;We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8208;3.1 eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Heptagonal Molecular Tiling via Self&#8208;Assembly of Heptagonal Phenylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular&#8208;level scrutinization of on&#8208;surface tiling garners considerable interest among scientists. Herein, we demonstrate molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling using the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring 14 long alkoxy substituents at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface using scanning tunneling microscopy. This heptagonal macrocycle produces an antiparallel pattern at the 1&#8208;phenyloctane&#8211;graphite interface through van der Waals interactions between the alkoxy chains. This pattern resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of heptagonal cores owing to intermolecular interactions between the alkoxy chains. Conversely, at the 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene&#8211;graphite interface, the heptagonal molecule forms an oblique pattern composed of four independent molecular orientations. This phenomenon arises from core distortion induced by the coadsorption of the solvent molecules within the intrinsic macrocyclic pores. This study elucidates the design strategy&#8212;specifically, the choice of heptagonal molecular building block&#8212;for heptagonal tiling and fills a crucial gap in the field of two&#8208;dimensional crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Free Functionalization of Saturated Heterocycles with Vinylarenes and Pyridine Enabled by Photocatalytic Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated heterocycles are important class of structural scaffolds in small&#8208;molecule drugs, natural products, and synthetic intermediates. Here, we disclosed a metal free, mild, and scalable functionalization of saturated heterocycles using vinylarenes as a linchpin approach. Key to success of this transformation is the employing of simple and cheap benzophenone as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst. This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions. The potential pharmaceutical utility of the procedure has also been demonstrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules. Initial mechanism studies and control experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions</dc:description>

This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions. The potential pharmaceutical utility of the procedure has also been demonstrated by late-stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules. Initial mechanism studies and control experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable Self&#8208;Regenerating Organic Multi&#8208;Redox Systems derived from Bicyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (BICAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable organic radical cations with multiple redox states spanning over notably wide redox range (1.8&#8197;V) were derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The availability of stable multiple redox states was utilized in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. The system works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process with a minimum capacity loss and regenerated upon exposure to air.







Abstract
An extended class of organic multi&#8208;redox systems was derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The highly&#8208;conjugated system undergoes a total of 4 redox events spanning a 1.8&#8197;V redox range. These organic compounds exhibited four different stable redox states (dication, radical cation, neutral and radical anion), and all of them were characterized either by single crystal X&#8208;ray study and/or various spectroscopic studies. Three of the four redox states are stable to air and moisture. The availability of stable multiple redox states demonstrated promise towards their efficacy in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. Among various redox states, the dication/neutral state works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process outside glovebox in commercially available DMF with minimum capacity loss (retaining nearly 90&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency). Surprisingly, the efficiency of the redox cycle was retained even if the system was exposed to air for 30&#8197;days when it slowly regenerated to the initial deep blue radical cation, and it exhibited another 100 charge/discharge cycles with a minimal capacity loss. Such a stable H&#8208;cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule&#8208;based systems.

         <title>In situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8208;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow Monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazonium trifluoroacetates for biphenyls are an underrated aryl radical source for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. This concept does not require any additional catalysts to perform an efficient and selective reaction. The photoarylation is supported by the application of Flow Chemistry using microreactors and modern LED technology. An integrated benchtop NMR spectrometer enables real&#8208;time analysis of the substituted products.







Abstract
A novel class of diazonium salts is introduced for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling to produce (substituted) biphenyls. As common diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts fail, soluble and safe aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are applied. In this mild synthesis route no catalysts are required to generate an aryl&#8208;radical by irradiation with UV&#8208;A light (365&#8197;nm). This reactive species undergoes direct C&#8722;H arylation at an arene, forming the product in reasonable reaction times. With the implementation of a continuous flow setup in a capillary photoreactor 13 different biphenyl derivatives are successfully synthesized. By integrating an inline 19F&#8208;NMR benchtop spectrometer, samples are reliably quantified as the fluorine&#8208;substituents act as a probe. Here, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy is a perfect tool to monitor the continuously operated system, which produces fine chemicals of industrial relevance even in a multigram scale.

         <title>Influence of Polymer Side Chain Size and Backbone Length on the Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Polymer Bottlebrushes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) can assemble into supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes in water when conjugated to hydrophilic polymers. Here we investigate the effect of side and main chain lengths of the attached polymers on the resulting morphologies. Both longer main and side chains induce a morphological transition from cylindrical to spherical micelles, but the latter can even prevent any form of aggregation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush&#8208;like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Aminobenzocoumarins as Fluorescent Probes for Biological Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pH probes applicable in staining lysosomes in live human cells have been synthesized and characterized. These aminobenzocoumarins display large Stokes shifts, emission in the visible region, and up to 300&#8208;fold emission intensity increase upon activation in acidic conditions.







Abstract
Regulation of pH plays an essential role in orchestrating the delicate cellular machinery responsible for life as we know it. Its abnormal values are indicative of aberrant cellular behavior and associated with pathologies including cancer progression or solid tumors. Here, we report a series of bent and linear aminobenzocoumarins decorated with different substituents. We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH&#8208;responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300&#8208;fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.

         <title>Eight&#8208;Electron Copper Nanoclusters for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise Cu54 nanoclusters with eight free valence electrons have been prepared, characterized, and structurally determined. The clusters show high performance in the field of photothermal conversion. For the first time, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are proved to be effective in photothermal application, which may stimulate the research on using copper nanoclusters in material sciences.







Abstract
Owing to distinct physicochemical properties in comparison to gold and silver counterparts, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are attracting embryonic interest in material science. The introduction of copper cluster nanomaterials in more interesting fields is currently urgent and desired. Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] (X=S or none, tBuSH=2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three&#8208;shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu14@Cl12@Cu40. Interestingly, the [SCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight&#8208;electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71&#8201;&#176;C within ~50&#8197;s, &#955;ex=445&#8197;nm, 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near&#8208;infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilization.

Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuS)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] (X=S or none, &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuSH=2-methyl-2-propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three-shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;@Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;. Interestingly, the [SCu&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuS)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight-electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71&#8201;&#176;C within ~50&#8197;s, &#955;&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;=445&#8197;nm, 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near-infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) solid solutions for improving solar fuels production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction by H2O vapour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleic acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Cationic Styryl Dyes in vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel method for synthesizing cationic styryl dyes through a nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction has been developed. This approach overcomes issues associated with traditional synthesis methods, such as harsh conditions, low throughput, and wasteful chemicals. The presence of a nucleic acid template accelerated the styryl dye formation from quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates. These styryl dyes show remarkable optical properties change when bound to nucleic acids, hence the success of the synthesis could be readily monitored in situ by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and the optical properties data were also observable at the same time. This method provides the desired products from a broad range of coupling partners. By employing different substrates and templates, it is possible to identify new dyes that can bind to a specific type of nucleic acid such as a G&#8208;quadruplex. The templated dye synthesis is also successfully demonstrated in live HeLa cells. This approach is a powerful tool for the rapid synthesis and screening of dyes specific for diverse types of nucleic acids or cellular organelles, facilitating new biological discoveries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Encapsulated Materials for Biological Cascade Chemistry and Synergistic Tumor Starvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Framework and polymeric nanoreactors (NRs) have distinct advantages in improving chemical reaction efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzyme is activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. High levels of H2O2 induce self&#8208;destruction of the vesicles by releasing quinone methide to deplete glutathione and suppress the antioxidant potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoreactors results in efficient tumor ablation via suppressing cancer&#8208;cell metabolism. The main driving force would be to take advantage of the distinct metabolic properties of cancer cells along with the high peroxidase&#8208;like activity of metalloenzyme/metalloprotein. A cascade strategy of dual enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and nitroreductase (NTR) wherein the former acts as an O2&#8208;consuming agent such as overexpression of NTR and further amplified NTR&#8208;catalyzed release for antitumor therapy. The design of cascade bioreductive hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery via GOx regulates NTR upregulation and NTR&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanoclusters in cascaded enzymes along with chemo&#8208;radiotherapy with synergistic therapy are illustrated. Finally, we outline the role of the nanoreactor strategy of cascading enzymes along with self&#8208;synergistic tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether Naphthotube Host&#8208;guest Complexes and [2]Rotaxanes with Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between ether naphthotube and a series of dication guests in organic solution were investigated. It was found that ether naphthotube formed stable host&#8208;guest complexes selectively with these guests in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with association constants ranging from 102 to 106 M&#8208;1, which were confirmed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectra and ITC experiments. The host&#8208;guest interactions are driven by enthalpy change as the entropic factors are unfavorable. Positive correlations between &#916;H and &#916;S have been observed in the host&#8208;guest complexes. Furthermore, the para&#8208;substitution of the guests can significantly affect the binding affinities through a combination of field/inductive and resonance effects by following a linear free energy relationship. Based on the host&#8208;guest complexes composed of ether naphthotube and organic cations, two interlocked [2]rotaxanes were prepared by cationization reaction and Huisgen cycloaddition between the cations and the stopper components. The ether naphthotube&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes are useful for creating sophisticated interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic ring systems have experienced a significant increase in importance in recent years due to their relevance in modern pharmaceuticals, as building blocks for designer materials or as synthetic intermediates. This necessitated the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of these strained ring systems focusing on effectiveness and scalability. The high ring strain of these entities as well as the use of high&#8208;energy reagents and intermediates has often challenged their synthesis. Continuous flow approaches have thus emerged as highly effective means to safely and reliably access these strained scaffolds. In this short review, key developments in this field are summarised showcasing the power of continuous flow approaches for accessing 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems via thermal, photo&#8208; and electrochemical processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization</dc:description>

         <title>On the Use of Triethyloxonium Tetrafluoroborate for Chloride Removal during Sarcosine&#160;N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Synthesis: Improving NCA purity for controlled ring opening polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical translation of polysarcosine (pSar) as polyethylene glycol (PEG) replacement in the development of novel nanomedicines creates a broad demand of polymeric material in high&#8208;quality making high&#8208;purity sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (Sar&#8208;NCA) as monomer for its production inevitable. Within this report, we present the use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis with focus on amino acid and chloride impurities to avoid the sublimation of Sar&#8208;NCAs. With a view towards upscaling into kilogram or ton scale, a new methodology of monomer purification is introduced by utilizing the Meerwein&#8217;s Salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to remove chloride impurities by covalent binding and converting chloride ions into volatile products within a single step. The novel straightforward technique enables access to monomers with significantly reduced chloride content (&lt;100&#160;ppm) compared to Sar&#8208;NCA derived by synthesis or sublimation. The derived monomers enable the controlled&#8208;living polymerization in DMF and provide access to pSar polymers with Poisson&#8208;like molecular weight distribution within a high range of chain lengths (Xn 25&#8208;200). In conclusion, the reported method can be easily applied to Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis or purification of commercially available pSar&#8208;NCAs and eases access to well&#8208;defined hetero&#8208;telechelic pSar polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective transition enhancement in a g&#8208;engineered diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A diradical with engineered g&#8208;asymmetry was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#729; radical platform. Various spectroscopic techniques and computational studies revealed that the electronic structures of the two spin systems remained minimally affected within the diradical system. Fluid&#8208;solution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments revealed a weak exchange coupling with |J| ~ 0.014 cm&#8208;1, subsequently rationalized by CAS&#8208;SCF calculations. Frozen solution continuous&#8208;wave (CW) EPR experiments showed a complicated and power&#8208;dependent spectrum that eluded analysis using the point&#8208;dipole model. Pulse EPR manipulations with varying microwave powers, or under varying magnetic fields, demonstrated that different resonances could be selectively enhanced or suppressed, based on their different tipping angles. In particular, Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra revealed absorptions of MW power&#8208;dependent intensities, while Field&#8208;Swept Spin Nutation (FSSN) experiments revealed two distinct Rabi frequencies. This study introduces a methodology to synthesize and characterize g&#8208;asymmetric two&#8208;spin systems, of interest in the implementation of spin&#8208;based CNOT gates.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium Pyridylpyrrolides Hyperpolarised by Para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical activation of the nuclear singlet state of dihydrogen, para&#8208;hydrogen, can dramatically increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Here, we show that the highly reversible activation of para&#8208;hydrogen by an iridium pyridylpyrrolide complex is capable of producing this hyperpolarisation effect. Bound alkene ligands exhibit signal enhancement without reduction to alkanes, which is in contrast to the most widely used hyperpolarisation catalysts. The complex is recoverable due to the highly reversible binding and release of H2, and result in enhanced hydride signals in a wide range of coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating deuterated solvents. Synthetic modification of the ligand substituents and the addition of co&#8208;ligands show a strong dependence of chemical structure on reactivity, which reveals an untapped potential to exploit pyridylpyrrolides as ligands in the development of tunable para&#8208;hydrogen induced hyperpolarisation catalysts or molecular probes.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enantioselective Aminocatalytic Cascade Reaction Affording Bioactive Hexahydroazulene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8211;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20:1), up to 96% ee, and yields up to 52%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Emergent Properties in Chemistry &#8208; Relating Molecular Properties to Bulk Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain physico&#8208;chemical properties like density or color emerge only when a sufficient number of atoms or molecules are combined in a suitable way. By discussing various case studies, such as the liquidity of water, we here investigate the fundamental types of emergence in chemistry. Studying how properties emerge enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of these properties.







Abstract
Certain properties of an object only emerge when a sufficient number of those objects are present in a definite arrangement. For example, one or two water molecules cannot said to be in a liquid state, but a drop of water can be. This concept of emergence has been studied extensively, but only occasionally discussed explicitly in the context of chemistry. In this paper, we aim to show the fruitfulness of the concept of emergence for chemical inquiry by considering four case studies of emergent chemical properties, i.&#8201;e., the liquidity and freezing of water, structural properties of crystals, thermodynamical phase transitions and quantum mechanical phenomena. We show that some of these properties emerge gradually, some at discrete points, and some should be taken to emerge only when the number of constituents tends to infinity. We argue that studying the way in which chemical properties emerge presents a useful avenue for research that promises greater insight into the nature of those properties.

         <title>Syntheses of &#945;(2,8) sialosides containing NeuAc and NeuGc by using double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acyl sialyl donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc&#8208;containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl sialyl donors. The 7&#8208;O,9&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl protection of an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;5&#8208;N,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;protected sialyl donor markedly increased the a&#8208;selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N&#8208;acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N&#8208;acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N&#8208;glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N&#8208;acetyl carbamate due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxygen in the N&#8208;acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N&#8208;glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C&#8208;6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent a&#8208;selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3&#8208;diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc-containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl-protected N-acetyl sialyl donors. The 7-O,9-O-carbonyl protection of an N-acyl-5-N,4-O-carbonyl-protected sialyl donor markedly increased the a-selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C-8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N-acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N-acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N-glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N-acetyl carbamate due to the electron-withdrawing oxygen in the N-acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N-glycolyl groups.

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Driven Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic trifluoromethylation is efficiently initiated through a photochemical reaction utilizing an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, proceeding smoothly without the use of photocatalysts, transition&#8208;metal catalysts, or additional oxidants. This method has been optimized through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its versatility and efficacy across various substrates, including quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. Notably, this approach enables the practical synthesis of trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones on a gram scale. Mechanistic investigations that incorporate radical trapping and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, confirmed the formation of the an EDA complex and elucidated the reaction pathways. This study highlights the crucial role of EDA photoactivation in trifluoromethylation, significantly expanding the application scope of EDA complexes in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Chiroptical Properties of Anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl Dimers as New Biaryls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimers of anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl units and its mesityl derivative were synthesized by Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the corresponding chloro derivatives as new biaryls. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed that two polycyclic aromatic units with nonplanar deformations took a twisted conformation about the single bond as a chiral axis. Enantiomers of the nonsubstituted compound were resolved by chiral HPLC, and the enantiopure samples showed intense Cotton effects at 321 nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and emission bands at 449 nm in the circularly polarized lumines&#173;cence (CPL) spectra with dissymmetry factor of |glum| 3.6 &#215; 10&#8211;3. The absolute stereochemistry of this biaryl was determined by the theoretical calculation of CD spectrum by the time&#8208;dependent DFT method. The barrier to enantiomerization was determined to be 108 kJ mol&#8211;1 at 298 K. The dynamic process proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving the helical inversion of each aromatic unit and the rotation about the biaryl axis as analyzed by the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A family of hexacopper phenylsilsesquioxane/acetate complexes: synthesis, solvent&#8208;controlled cage structures, and catalytic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Convenient self&#8208;assembly synthesis of copper(II) complexes via double (phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate) ligation allows to isolate a family of impressive sandwich&#8208;like cage compounds. An intriguing feature of these complexes is the difference in the structure of a pair of silsesquioxane ligands despite identical (Cu6) nuclearity and number (four) of acetate fragments. Formation of particular combination of silsesquioxane ligands (cyclic/cyclic vs condensed/condensed vs cyclic/condensed) was found to be dependent on the synthesis/crystallization media. A combination of Si4&#8208;cyclic and Si6&#8208;condensed silsesquioxane ligands is a brand new feature of cage metallasilsesquioxanes. A representative Cu6&#8208;complex (4) (with cyclic silsesquioxanes) exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols with peroxides. Maximum yield of the products of cyclohexane oxidation attained 30%. The compound 4 was also tested as catalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone by m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid: maximum yields of 88% and 100% of &#949;&#8208;caprolactone were achieved upon conventional heating at 50 &#176;C for 4 h and MW irradiation at 70 or 80 &#176;C during 30 min, respectively. It was also possible to obtain the lactone (up to 16% yield) directly from the cyclohexane via a tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction using the same oxidant.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Ultrafine PtIr Clusters supported on Co3O4 Nanoflowers for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green hydrogen production through electrochemical overall water splitting has suffered from sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, inferior conversion efficiency, and high cost. Herein, ultrafine PtIr clusters are synthesized via an electrodeposition method and decorated on the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires (PtIr&#8208;Co3O4). The encouraging performances in electrochemical OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are achieved over the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst, with the overpotentials as low as 410 and 237 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, outperforming the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Due to the ultralow loading of PtIr clusters, the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst exhibits 1270 A gIr&#8208;1 for OER at the overpotential of 400 mV. Our detailed analyses also show that the strong interactions between the ultrafine PtIr clusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers enable the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst to afford 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for the overall water splitting at the potential of 1.57 V, accompanied by high durability for 100 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom Promoted Polyhexagonal Saddle&#8208;Shaped Molecular Structure and Its Supramolecular Coassembly with C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with curved architecture can exhibit unique opto&#8208;electronic properties due to the concave&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;surface. However, synthesizing negatively curved saddle&#8208;shaped aromatic systems has been challenging due to the internal structural strain. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of two polyhexagonal molecular systems, 1 and 2, with saddle shape geometry by judiciously varying the aromatic moiety, avoiding the harsh synthetic methods as that of heptagonal aromatic saddle systems. The unique geometry preferences of B, N, and S furnish suitable curvature to the molecules, featuring saddle shape. The saddle geometry also enables them to interact with fullerene C60, and the supramolecular interactions of fullerene C60with 1 and 2 modify their optoelectronic properties. Crystal structure analysis reveals that 1, with a small &#960;&#8208;surface, forms a double columnar array of fullerenes in the solid state. In contrast, 2 with a large &#960;&#8208;surface produces a supramolecular capsule entrapping discrete fullerene dimer. The intermolecular interactions between B, N, S, and the aryl&#8208;&#960; surface of the host and C60 guest are the stabilizing factors for creating these supramolecular structures. Comprehensive computational, optical, electrochemical, and Raman spectroscopic studies establish the charge transfer interactions between B&#8208;N doped heterocycle host and fullerene C60 guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacteria at Work &#8211; Experimental and Theoretical Studies Reveal the Catalytic Mechanism of Ectoine Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ectoine is a compound gaining popularity in recent years, having unique moisturizing and cell&#8208;protective properties. This osmolyte is produced by many bacteria species via the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, the final stage of which is&#160;catalyzed by Ectoine Synthase (EctC). Here, the catalytic mechanism of EctC is proposed, supported by theoretical (QM/MM) and experimental studies (Mossbauer spectroscopy).







Abstract
Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe2+&#8208;dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe2+ ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC&#8208;catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu57, Tyr84 and His92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur. They fill the first coordination sphere of the Fe2+&#8208;cofactor and act as critical proton donors and acceptors during the cyclization reaction.

         <title>Tryptophan&#8208;Doped Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films with Ultralong&#8208;Lifetime Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Color&#8208;Tunable Afterglow Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(vinyl alcohol) films doped with eight different tryptophan derivatives have been shown to exhibit ultralong phosphorescence emission under ambient conditions. The afterglow color of the films can be adjusted through a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process.







Abstract
The development of a persistent luminescence system with long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable afterglow at room temperature represents a challenge, largely due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathway. In this study, an ultralong&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system has been achieved using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding strategy where poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices were doped with tryptophan (Trp) derivatives. The PVA film doped with N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(9&#8208;Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan (Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) exhibited a long&#8208;lived phosphorescence emission of up to 3859.70&#8197;ms, and a blue afterglow for a duration greater than 34&#8197;s, under ambient conditions. The introduction of two other fluorescent dyes (i.&#8201;e., Rhodamine B and Basicred14) to the PVA film facilitates adjustment to the color of the afterglow from blue to orange, and pink, by a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process. These films have been successfully applied in silk&#8208;screen printing and in multicolor afterglow light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) arrays.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Spin Regulation in Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, magnetic fields have been regarded as an effective tool to modify magnetic domain structure and change the spin multiplicity of electrons during the electrocatalysis process. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent development of spin regulation induced by the magnetic field in electrocatalysis. Finally, we point out the challenges and perspectives in spin&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of a magnetic field to manipulate spin states has emerged as a novel approach to enhance efficiency in electrocatalytic reactions, distinguishing from traditional strategies that focus on tuning activation energy barriers. Currently, this approach is specifically tailored to reactions where spin states change during the catalytic process, such as the oxidation of singlet H2O to triplet O2. In the magnetically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) procedure, the parallel spin alignment on the ferromagnetic catalyst was induced by the external magnetic field, facilitating the triplet O&#8722;O bonding, which is the rate limiting step in OER. This review centers on recent advancements in harnessing external magnetic fields to enhance OER performance, delving into mechanistic approaches for this magnetic promotion. Additionally, we provide a summary of magnetic field application in other electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Cellular Applications of DNP Solid&#8208;State NMR &#8211; State of the Art and a Look to the Future</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR has opened the door to probing the structures of protein in&#8197;situ at atomic resolution. Here we discuss the methodologies&#8217; state of the art, current bottlenecks, and present possible solutions to the latter ranging from application of novel biochemical approaches to purely spectroscopic considerations.







Abstract
Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR is emerging as a powerful technique for probing the structural properties of conformationally homogenous and heterogenous biomolecular species irrespective of size at atomic resolution within their native environments. Herein we detail advancements that have made acquiring such data, specifically within the confines of intact bacterial and eukaryotic cell a reality and further discuss the type of structural information that can presently be garnered by the technique's exploitation. Subsequently, we discuss bottlenecks that have thus far curbed cellular DNP&#8208;ssNMR's broader adoption namely due a lack of sensitivity and spectral resolution. We also explore possible solutions ranging from utilization of new pulse sequences, design of better performing polarizing agents, and application of additional biochemical/ cell biological methodologies.

         <title>Leveraging Halogen Interactions for a Supramolecular Nanotube</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal is observed. The supramolecular nanotube growth is templated by intermolecular halogen interactions between individual macrocycles encoded directly in their structure creating a well defined nanochannel.







Abstract
We demonstrate the formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal by balancing the hydrogen bonds and halogen interactions between individual macrocycles. Thereby, we template the supramolecular nanotube growth by intermolecular interactions encoded directly in the macrocycles instead of those provided by the crystallization solvent. Ultimately, we show that replacing bromines for iodines in the macrocycle is necessary to achieve this supramolecular organization by enhancing the strength of the halogen interactions and concomitant reduction of the detrimental hydrogen bonds. We investigated the nature and the interplay of the individual intermolecular interactions by analysis of the experimental single crystal data and quantum chemical calculations. This work enriches the available toolbox of supramolecular interactions and will aid and abet the development of rationally&#8208;designed materials with a long&#8208;range 1D tubular organization.

         <title>Parametric Analysis of Donor Activation for Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of complex oligosaccharides relies on efficient and highly reproducible glycosylation reactions. The outcome of a glycosylation is contingent upon several environmental factors, such as temperature, acidity, the presence of residual moisture, as well as the steric, electronic, and conformational aspects of the reactants. Each glycosylation proceeds rapidly and with a high yield within a rather narrow temperature range. For better control over glycosylations and to ensure fast and reliable reactions, a systematic analysis of 18 glycosyl donors revealed the effect of reagent concentration, water content, protecting groups, and structure of the glycosyl donors on the activation temperature. With these insights, we parametrize the first step of the glycosylation reaction to be executed reliably and efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocontrolled Binding of Styrylnaphthyridine Ligands to Abasic Site&#8208;containing DNA by Reversible [2+2] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five novel styrylnaphthyridine derivatives were synthesized and shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA), which is an important therapeutic and diagnostic target. These compounds associate with AP&#8208;DNA with binding constants of 0.5&#8211;8.4 &#215; 104 M&#8211;1 as shown by photometric and fluorimetric titrations. Specifically, these ligands bind preferentially to AP&#8208;DNA relative to regularly paired duplex DNA. As a special feature, the association of these ligands with DNA can be controlled by means of a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition. Upon irradiation at 420 nm the photodimer is formed, which does not bind to AP&#8208;DNA. In turn, the naphthyridine is regained with excitation at 315 nm. Most notably, this photoinduced deactivation and release of the DNA ligand can be performed in situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder. Overall, these results provide a promising starting point for the development of functional AP&#8208;DNA ligands whose bioactivity can be modulated by light with local and temporal control.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Peroxynitrite, [O&#8208;N&#8208;O&#8208;O]&#8211;, via a Cascade of Reactions between Ozonide and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on an unexpected reaction between ammonia and potassium ozonide dissolved in liq. NH3 resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite, [ONOO]&#8211;, which exclusively happens in the presence of a specific partially fluorinated aniline based ammonium cation. High&#8208;resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite anion in cis&#8208;conformation have been obtained. We further studied this molecule anion by single crystal Raman spectroscopy. The cis and trans isomers of peroxynitrite were analyzed computationally with respect to their relative energies, the cis&#8208;trans transition barrier and their decomposition pathways to the nitrate anion. By experimentally examining cations decorated with fluorine ligands to different degrees, we demonstrate that fluorine specific interactions play a crucial role in the unexpected formation of peroxynitrite and as a conspicuously structure directing factor for the underlying crystalline solid phases, exhibiting distinct micro&#8208;separations of fluorine and hydrogen enriched regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphoramide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Effective Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective and facile synthetic routes to organic ligands, along with porous materials that exhibit exceptional gas&#8208;storage properties, promise significant industrial applications. Here, a two&#8208;step synthesis of novel organophosphorus ligands without metal catalysts is reported. These ligands serve as versatile linkers for the construction of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating various metal ions, including zinc and copper. One of the zinc&#8208;based MOFs demonstrates remarkable gas&#8208;storage properties, with a hydrogen (H2) capacity exceeding 2.5 wt% at 77 K and 100 kPa as well as a carbon dioxide (CO2) capacity exceeding 20 wt% at 298 K and 100 kPa. Furthermore, this zinc&#8208;based MOF can be synthesized through a solvothermal process on the gram scale that yields high&#8208;quality single crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>New Phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole&#8208;Based Fluorophores with Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics for Highly Efficient Blue Non&#8208;doped OLEDs with Negligible Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is vital to develop highly efficient non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off for applications in display and lighting. Herein, two blue D&#8208;A fluorophores TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO are designed and synthesized, in which phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole (PO) acts as the acceptor and triphenylamine as the donor. TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO display good thermal stability and efficient luminescence efficiency in neat film. Results based on photophysical property and theoretical calculation demonstrate that TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO possess the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, which can utilize the triplet exciton to achieve highly efficient electroluminance (EL). The non&#8208;doped OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PO/TPA&#8208;DPO as pure emissive layer show the uniform EL emission peak at 468 nm, corresponding to CIE coordinates of (0.168, 0.187) and (0.167, 0.167), respectively. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs provide the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.99% and high exciton utility efficiency of 48.4%~72.6%. Moreover, the TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based device exhibits low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off, still maintaining the EQE of 6.03% at the high luminance of 5000 cd m&#8208;2. Those findings state clearly that PO is a promising building block of blue fluorophore with a potential HLCT feature to be applied in non&#8208;doped OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites for Glioma Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glioma, the most common primary brain tumor, is highly invasive and grows rapidly. As such, the survival of glioma patients is relatively short, highlighting the vital importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of glioma. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the non&#8208;targeting delivery systems of contrast agents and drugs greatly hinder the effective glioma imaging and therapy. Fortunately, in recent years, investigators have constructed various biomimetic delivery platforms utilizing the exceptional advantages of biomimetic nanocomposites, such as immune evasion, homologous targeting ability, and BBB penetrating ability, to achieve efficient and precise delivery of substances to glioma sites for improved diagnosis and treatment. In this concept, we present the application of these biomimetic nanocomposites in fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multi&#8208;modal imaging, as well as in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy for glioma. Lastly, we provide our perspective&#160;on&#160;this research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Cellular Uptake of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Activated by Amphiphilic p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their ability to activate the uptake of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) into vesicles and into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells is reported. First mechanistic studies suggest that CX4&#8208;Cn are excellent to afford an efficient cellular delivery of CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their application as efficient counterion activators for membrane transport of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). The enhanced membrane activity is confirmed with the carboxyfluorescein (CF) assay in vesicles and by the direct cytosolic delivery of CPPs into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells enabling excellent cellular uptake of the CPPs into two cancer cell lines. Intracellular delivery was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after CPP entry into live cells mediated by CX4&#8208;Cn, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships for calixarene&#8208;based counterion activators and show that CX4&#8208;Cn are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, CX4&#8208;C12, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP&#8208;counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of CX4&#8208;Cn for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.

&lt;/b&gt;, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure-activity relationships for calixarene-based counterion activators and show that &lt;b&gt;CX4-C&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, &lt;b&gt;CX4-C12&lt;/b&gt;, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP-counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of &lt;b&gt;CX4-C&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP-conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2 photoreduction over semiconducting 2D materials with supported single atoms: recent progress and challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the face of the growing energy crisis and environmental challenges, substantial efforts are now directed toward sustainable clean energy as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels. CO2 photoreduction into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is widely recognized as a promising approach to mitigate current energy and environmental concerns. Photocatalysts comprising single atoms (SAs) supported on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials (SAs&#8208;2DSemi) have emerged as a novel frontier due to the combined merits of SA catalysts and 2D materials. In this study, we review advancements in metal SAs confined on 2DSemi substrates, categorized into four groups: (1) metal oxide&#8208;based, (2) g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based, (3) emerging, and (4) hybridized 2DSemi, for photocatalytic CO2 conversion over the past few years. With a particular focus on highlighting the distinct advantages of SAs&#8208;2DSemi, we delve into the synthesis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, their catalytic performances, and mechanistic elucidation facilitated by experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Following this, we outline the challenges in this field and offer perspectives on harnessing the potential of SAs&#8208;2DSemi as promising photocatalysts. This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights for the future development of 2D photocatalytic materials involving SAs for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction of 1&#8208;Naphthols and Electron&#8208;Rich Phenols with Isatin&#8208;Derived Ketimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Products with up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee were obtained in aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines using Cu(II) complex bearing binaphthyl&#8208;proline&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;based tridentate chiral ligand as catalyst. The system showed good scalability, and reaction carried out in gram&#8208;scale also provided the desired product in excellent ee.







Abstract
New chiral ligands could be obtained by introducing proline moieties and imidazoline moieties to binaphthyl skeletons. The chiral ligands exhibited balanced rigidity and flexibility which could allow the change of the conformations during the reactions on one hand, and could provide sufficient asymmetric induction on the other. The proline moiety could act as a linker connecting the binaphthyl skeletons and the imidazoline moieties as well as a coordinating group for the central metal, and the electronic and steric properties of the imidazoline groups could be carefully fine&#8208;tuned by the use of different substituents. In the presence of Cu(II) catalyst bearing such chiral ligands, aza&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines provided the desired products with good to excellent yields and up to 99&#8201;% ee. The reactions showed good scalability, and excellent ee could still be obtained when the reaction was carried out in gram&#8208;scale.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy for Constructing Porous Boron and Nitrogen Co&#8208;Doped Carbon as an Efficient ORR Electrocatalyst toward Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to construct porous N and B doped carbon materials (BCN&#8208;P) as efficient metal&#8208;free ORR catalysts for zinc&#8208;air battery, which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as nitrogen and boron sources. BCN&#8208;P exhibits better ORR catalytic activity than its single dopant counterpart, and even comparable to Pt/C in zinc&#8208;air battery performance.







Abstract
Carbon nanomaterials doped with N and B could activate nearby carbon atoms to promote charge polarization through the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, thus facilitating adsorption of O2 and weakening O&#8722;O bond to enhance oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, a simple and controllable self&#8208;assembly strategy is applied to synthesize porous B, N co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;based catalysts (BCN&#8208;P), which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) as nitrogen source, and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as boron source. In addition, polystyrene microspheres are added to help introduce porous structure to expose more active sites. Benefitting from porous structures and the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, BCN&#8208;P has a high onset potential (Eonset=0.846&#8197;V) and half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.74&#8197;V) in alkaline media. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with BCN&#8208;P shows high operating voltage (1.42&#8197;V), peak power density (128.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable charge/discharge cycles, which is even comparable with Pt/C.

         <title>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene: A Building Block for Design of Macrocycles with Excited State Aromatic Low&#8208;Lying High&#8208;Spin States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the electronic structure and (anti)aromatic character of 3,4&#8208;dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) and of macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units in their lowest&#8208;lying states of different multiplicities. The designed macrocycles exhibit very stable low&#8208;lying nonet states, which can be even thermally populated as result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) is an unusual isomer of benzene. Motivated by recent synthetic progress to substituted derivatives of this scaffold, we carried out a theoretical and computational analysis with a particular focus on the extent of (anti)aromatic character in the lowest excited states of different multiplicities. We found that the parent DMCB is non&#8208;aromatic in its singlet ground state (S0), lowest triplet state (T1), and lowest singlet excited state (S1), while it is aromatic in its lowest quintet state (Q1) as this state is represented by a triplet multiplicity cyclobutadiene (CBD) ring and two uncoupled same&#8208;spin methylene radicals. Interestingly, the Q1 state, despite having four unpaired electrons, is placed merely 4.8&#8197;eV above S0, and there is a corresponding singlet tetraradical 0.16&#8197;eV above. The DMCB is potentially a highly useful structural motif for the design of larger molecular entities with interesting optoelectronic properties. Here, we designed macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units, and according to our computations, two of these have low&#8208;lying nonet states (i.&#8201;e., octaradical states) at energies merely 2.40 and 0.37&#8197;eV above their S0 states as a result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromatic character of individual 6&#960;&#8208; and 4&#960;&#8208;electron monocycles.

&lt;p&gt;We studied the electronic structure and (anti)aromatic character of 3,4-dimethylenecyclobutene (&lt;b&gt;DMCB&lt;/b&gt;) and of macrocycles composed of fused &lt;b&gt;DMCB&lt;/b&gt; units in their lowest-lying states of different multiplicities. The designed macrocycles exhibit very stable low-lying nonet states, which can be even thermally populated as result of local H&#252;ckel- and Baird-aromaticity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3,4-Dimethylenecyclobutene (&lt;b&gt;DMCB&lt;/b&gt;) is an unusual isomer of benzene. Motivated by recent synthetic progress to substituted derivatives of this scaffold, we carried out a theoretical and computational analysis with a particular focus on the extent of (anti)aromatic character in the lowest excited states of different multiplicities. We found that the parent &lt;b&gt;DMCB&lt;/b&gt; is non-aromatic in its singlet ground state (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), lowest triplet state (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), and lowest singlet excited state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), while it is aromatic in its lowest quintet state (Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) as this state is represented by a triplet multiplicity cyclobutadiene (&lt;b&gt;CBD&lt;/b&gt;) ring and two uncoupled same-spin methylene radicals. Interestingly, the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state, despite having four unpaired electrons, is placed merely 4.8&#8197;eV above S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and there is a corresponding singlet tetraradical 0.16&#8197;eV above. The &lt;b&gt;DMCB&lt;/b&gt; is potentially a highly useful structural motif for the design of larger molecular entities with interesting optoelectronic properties. Here, we designed macrocycles composed of fused &lt;b&gt;DMCB&lt;/b&gt; units, and according to our computations, two of these have low-lying nonet states (&lt;i&gt;i.&#8201;e&lt;/i&gt;., octaradical states) at energies merely 2.40 and 0.37&#8197;eV above their S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; states as a result of local H&#252;ckel- and Baird-aromatic character of individual 6&#960;- and 4&#960;-electron monocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Socialane, a Nonaprenyl Terpene Hydrocarbon Surface Lipid from the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike insects, some of the tiny Collembola use large terpenes as epicuticular lipids. The identification and synthesis of socialane, the first cyclic regular nonaprenyl terpene from the cuticle of the springtail Hypogastrura socialis is reported. In the background, the nanostructure of the superhydrophobic collembolan cuticle is shown.







Abstract
Springtails use unique compounds for their outermost epicuticular wax layer, often of terpenoid origin. We report here the structure and synthesis of socialane, the major cuticular constituent of the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis. Socialane is also the first regular nonaprenyl terpene with a cyclic head group. The saturated side chain has seven stereogenic centers, making the determination of the configuration difficult. We describe here the identification of socialane and a synthetic approach using the building blocks farnesol and phytol, enantioselective hydrogenation, and &#945;&#8208;alkylation of sulfones for the synthesis of various stereoisomers. NMR experiments showed the presence of an anti&#8208;configuration of the methyl groups closest to the benzene ring and that the other methyl groups of the polyprenyl side&#8208;chain are not uniformly configured. Furthermore, socialane is structurally different from [6+2]&#8208;terpene viaticene of the closely related H. viatica, showing species specificity of the epicuticular lipids of this genus and hinting at a possible role of surface lipids in the communication of these gregarious arthropods.

         <title>A Chiral [2+3] Covalent Organic Cage Based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cage formed with three 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL units was prepared through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach. This architecture contains six OH functions pointing inside the cavity. Host&#8208;guest studies demonstrated enantiopreference of the cage for a chiral ammonium cation.







Abstract
A [2+3] chiral covalent organic cage is produced through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach by mixing two readily available building units, viz. an enantiopure 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diformyl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL compound (A) with a triamino spacer (B). The two enantiomeric (R,R,R) and (S,S,S) forms of the cage C are formed nearly quantitatively thanks to the reversibility of the imine linkage. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of cage (S,S,S)&#8208;C highlights that the six OH functions of the BINOL fragments are positioned inside the cage cavity. Upon reduction of the imine bonds of cage C, the amine cage D is obtained. The ability of the cage D to host the 1&#8208;phenylethylammonium cation (EH+) as a guest is evaluated through UV, CD and DOSY NMR studies. A higher binding constant for (R)&#8208;EH+ cation (Ka=1.7 106&#177;10&#8201;%&#8197;M&#8722;1) related to (S)&#8208;EH+ (Ka=0.9 106&#177;10&#8201;%&#8197;M&#8722;1) is determined in the presence of the (R,R,R)&#8208;D cage. This enantiopreference is in close agreement with molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Controlling the Crystal Growth of DNA Molecules via Strategic Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules remains elusive. Herein we have successfully accelerated the crystal growth of DNA molecules by introducing the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation into their stacking sites, and decelerated it by introducing the phosphorothioate. Further, we have developed a novel strategy for controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions are critical to the crystallization of biomolecules, yet the precise control of biomolecular crystal growth based on these interactions remains elusive. To understand the connections between the crystallization kinetics and the strength of intermolecular interactions, herein we have employed DNA triangular crystals and modified ones as a versatile tool to investigate how the strength of intermolecular interaction affects crystal growth. Interestingly, we have found that the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation at sticky ends of the DNA triangle could strengthen its intermolecular interaction, resulting in the accelerated formation of smaller crystals. Conversely, phosphorothioate modification could weaken the sticky&#8208;end cohesion and delay the nucleation, resulting in formation of fewer but larger crystals. In addition, these modification effects were consistently observed in the crystallization of a DNA decamer. In one word, our experimental results demonstrate that the strength of intermolecular interaction directly impacts crystal growth. It suggests that 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation and phosphorothioate modification represents a rational strategy for controlling DNA molecules grow into desired crystals and it also facilitates structural determination.

         <title>Replacement of Toxic Hydrazines in Satellite Propulsion with Greener Dinitramide&#8208;based Energetic Ionic Liquid Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Satellite propulsion uses liquid mono or bi&#8208;propellants composed of a hydrazine in combination with a strong oxidant. However, hydrazines are highly toxic. As a result, many research efforts for more environmentally compatible propellants have been made over the past decade. In this study we evidence green formulations that retain high propulsive performances. They are based on the dinitramide anion. From an initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides 3 best candidates were selected after evaluation of their potential syntheses, calculated theoretical performances, experimental synthesis optimizations and decomposition temperatures. These three salts were then formulated to obtain acceptable sensitivities and melting points, which eventually led to only one formulation being retained: a 40:60 mixture of dimethylammonium dinitramide and ammonium dinitramide phlegmatized by 10% of glycerol.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Grown on the Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide to Realize High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Glucose Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose holds significant importance in disease diagnosis as well as beverage quality monitoring. The high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical sensor plays a crucial role in the electrochemical conversion technology.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glucose holds significant importance in disease diagnosis as well as beverage quality monitoring. The high-efficiency electrochemical sensor plays a crucial role in the electrochemical conversion technology. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are provided with high specific surface area and redox activity that are widely used in electrochemistry. Conductive metal-organic frameworks (cMOFs) perfectly combine the structural controllability of organic materials with the long-range ordering of inorganic materials that possess the characteristic of high electron mobility. Based on the above considerations, the combination of Ni(OH)2 and Ni-HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) as an electrode modification material is designed to enhance electrochemical performance. In this work, to improve glucose detection, a sequence of Ni(OH)2@NiCo-HHTP and NiM-LDH@Ni-HHTP (M = Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH = layered double hydroxide) are successfully synthesised by doping metals into Ni-HHTP and Ni(OH)2, respectively.

         <title>Stabilization of the Neutral [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) Radical by Hetero&#8208;Bimetal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilization of hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) (named &#8220;rosarin&#8221;) in its 25&#960; radical state is achieved using a hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination strategy. The antiaromatic BF2 complex B&#8208;1 was first synthesized, and then rhodium ion was inserted into B&#8208;1 to produce the BF2/Rh(CO)2 mixed complex Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 as a highly air&#8208;stable radical. The structures of B&#8208;1 and Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, and the antiaromatic or radical character was identified by various spectroscopy evidence and theoretical calculations. Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 exhibits excellent redox properties, enabling amphoteric aromatic&#8208;antiaromatic conversion to their 24/26&#960; states. Compared to the 24/26&#960; conjugation systems on the same skeleton, Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 has the narrowest electrochemical and optical band gaps, with the longest absorption band at 1010 nm. The ring&#8208;current analysis reveals intense paratropic currents for B&#8208;1 and co&#8208;existing diatropic&#8208;paratropic currents for Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1. This hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination system provides a novel platform for organic radical stabilization on porphyrinoids, showing the prospect of modulating ligand oxidation states through rational coordination design.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Red&#8208;Absorbing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct (DASA), a class of push&#8208;pull negative photochromes, has received large interest lately owing to its versatile synthesis, modularity and excellent photoswitching in solutions. From a technological perspective, it is imperative for this class of photoswitches to work robustly in solid state, e.g. thin films. We feature a molecular framework for the optimized design of DASAs by introducing a new thioindoline donor (D3) and assessing its performance against known 2nd generation indoline&#8208;based donors. The systematic structure&#8208;function investigations suggest that to achieve robust reversible photoswitching, a ground state with low charge separation is desired. DASAs with stronger electron donors and a larger charge separation in the ground state result in a low population of the photothermalstationary state (PTSS) and reduced photostability. The DASA with thioindoline donor (D3A3) seems to be a special case among the donor series as it causes a red shift (ca. 15 nm), however with less polarization of the ground state and marginally better photostability as compared to the unsubstituted 2&#8208;methyl indoline (D1A3). We also emphasize the consideration of the key additional factors that can modulate the red&#8208;light photoswitching properties of DASA chromophores in polymer thin films, which might not be dominant in homogenous solution state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxane Shuttle for Chloride&#8208;Selective Optical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a [2]rotaxane shuttle capable of selective optical sensing of chloride anions over other halides is reported. The rotaxane was synthesised via a chloride ion template&#8208;directed cyclisation of an isophthalamide macrocycle around a multi&#8208;station axle containing peripheral naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations and a halogen bonding (XB) bis(iodotriazole) based station. Proton NMR studies indicate the macrocycle resides preferentially at the NDI stations in the free rotaxane, where it is stabilised by aromatic donor&#8208;acceptor charge transfer interactions between the axle NDI and macrocycle hydroquinone moieties. Addition of chloride ions in an aqueous&#8208;acetone solvent mixture induces macrocycle translocation to the XB anion binding station to facilitate the formation of convergent XB&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Cl&#9472; and hydrogen bonding HB&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Cl&#9472; interactions, which is accompanied by a reduction of the charge&#8208;transfer absorption band. Importantly, little to no optical response was induced by addition of bromide or iodide to the rotaxane, indicative of the size discriminative steric inaccessibility of the interlocked cavity to the larger halides, demonstrating the potential of using the mechanical bond effect as a potent strategy and tool in chloride&#8208;selective chemo&#8208;sensing applications in aqueous containing solvent environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluating Diazene to N2 Interconversion at Iron&#8208;Sulfur Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interconversion of N2H2 and N2 is probed using &#956;&#8208;N2H2 iron&#8208;sulfur complexes. An intermediate trapped at low temperature was formerly presumed to be a &#956;&#8208;N2 species, but new in&#8197;situ spectroscopic characterization shows a new assignment. Our results are used to predict requirements to observe iron&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based reversible proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) for N2 fixation.







Abstract
Biological N2 reduction occurs at sulfur&#8208;rich multiiron sites, and an interesting potential pathway is concerted double reduction/ protonation of bridging N2 through PCET. Here, we test the feasibility of using synthetic sulfur&#8208;supported diiron complexes to mimic this pathway. Oxidative proton transfer from &#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;diazene (HN=NH) is the microscopic reverse of the proposed N2 fixation pathway, revealing the energetics of the process. Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two&#8208;electron oxidation of [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2H2)] (L1=tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C as [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)]2+, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N2 complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr3)L1}(&#951;2&#8208;N2H2)]+. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature. Also, PCET from the bridging diazene is highly exergonic as a result of the high Fe3+/2+ redox potential, indicating that the reverse N2 protonation would be too endergonic to proceed. This system establishes the &#8220;ground rules&#8221; for designing reversible N2/N2H2 interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Access to N,O&#8208;Acetals from Enamides by Means of Electron&#8208;Poor Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamides can be converted into their N,O&#8208;acetals using just electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimides together with light, without the need for thiophenol as additive or strong acids as catalyst.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;acetals are found as structural motifs in natural products and are important synthetic precursors for N&#8208;acylimines as building blocks in organic synthesis for C&#8722;C&#8208;bond formation and amines. For the synthesis of N,O&#8208;acetals, an acid&#8208;, base&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic method is reported applying N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide and N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;2,5,8,11&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide as extremely electron&#8208;deficient photocatalysts. The first perylene bisimide highly selectively photocatalyzes the formation of the N,O&#8208;acetals as products in high yields, and the second and more electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide allows these reactions without thiophenol as an H&#8208;atom transfer reagent. Calculated electron density maps support this. The reaction scope comprises different substituents at the nitrogen of the enamides and different alcohols as starting material. Dehydroalanines are converted to non&#8208;natural amino acids which shows the usefulness of this method for organic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate simulation models are established and developed to investigate Fe doping profile on current collapse in GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). By controlling Fe doping profile in GaN buffer layer, current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) of GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Using computer&#8208;aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) in 0.5&#8208;&#956;m gated GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de&#8208;trapping of Fe&#8208;related traps at the gate&#8208;drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep&#8208;level acceptors would boost &#9653;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (nT) induces a relatively small &#9653;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#9653;CC of GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%. The optimized distribution of Fe doping discussed in this work helps to prepare GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs with a limited current collapse effect.

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8211;Driven Self&#8211;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymers, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures.







Abstract
With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8211;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.

         <title>Scope and Limitations of Using Microemulsions for the Covalent Patterning of Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the scope and limitations of using microemulsions (MEMs) as templates to pattern graphene covalently. This methodology is very simple and can be used to obtain functionalization in either the major (out&#8208;patterning) or the minor (in&#8208;patterning) components of the MEM.







Abstract
Patterning of graphene (functionalizing some areas while leaving others intact) is challenging, as all the C atoms in the basal plane are identical, but it is also desirable for a variety of applications, like opening a bandgap in the electronic structure of graphene. Several methods have been reported to pattern graphene, but most of them are very technologically intensive. Recently, we reported the use of microemulsions as templates to pattern graphene at the &#956;m scale. This method is very simple and in principle tunable, as emulsions of different droplet size and composition can be prepared easily. Here, we explore in detail the scope of this methodology by applying it to all the combinations of four different emulsions and three different organic reagents, and characterizing the resulting substrates exhaustively through Raman, SEM and AFM. We find that the method is general, works better when the reactive species are outside the micelles, and requires reactive species that involve short reaction times.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Containing Bis(squaraine) Dyes: Design, Synthesis and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three azulene&#8208;containing bis(squaraine) dyes were synthesized, among which BSQ1 showed distinct aggregation behaviors from the other two dimers and demonstrated excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. In nanoparticles, BSQ1 formed J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 displayed H&#8208;aggregates. In films, BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures upon thermal annealing with improved charge transport capabilities.







Abstract
The relationship among chemical structure, physicochemical property and aggregation behavior of organic functional material is an important research topic. Here, we designed and synthesized three bis(squaraine) dyes BSQ1, BSQ2 and BSQ3 through the combination of two kinds of unsymmetrical azulenyl squaraine monomers. Their physicochemical properties were investigated in both molecular and aggregate states. Generally, BSQ1 displayed different assembly behaviors from BSQ2 and BSQ3. Upon fabrication into nanoparticles, BSQ1 tend to form J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 tend to form H&#8208;aggregates in aqueous medium. When in the form of thin films, three bis(squaraine) dyes all adopted J&#8208;aggregation packing modes while only BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures as well as the improvement in the carrier mobilities upon thermal annealing. Our research highlights the discrepancy of aggregation behaviors originating from the molecular structure and surrounding circumstances, providing guidance for the molecular design and functional applications of squaraines.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of PdCuAg and CeO2 Nanowires Hybrid with Abundant Heterojunction Interface for Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing CeO2 into Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via one&#8208;pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06 A mgPd&#8208;1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Study on Auto&#8208;Catalysis and Product Inhibition: A Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction Catalysed within the Cavity of an Octanuclear Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octanuclear cubic coordination cage catalyses the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a cavity&#8208;bound guest, 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). The product 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP) remained bound within the cavity, providing both autocatalysis in the early stages and inhibition in the late stages of the reaction. A red&#8208;shift in the UV/Vis spectrum revealed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host to guest binding, this was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis.







Abstract
The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity&#8208;bound guest was studied with 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH&#8197;8.6). The rate enhancement of kcat/kuncat was determined to be 22, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto&#8208;catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red&#8208;shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red&#8208;shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4&#8208;nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH&#8197;8.6. The red&#8208;shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X&#8208;ray crystallography; and was also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution&#8208;state.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a technique for detecting small amounts of (bio)chemical analytes has become increasingly popular in various fields. While gold and silver nanostructures have been extensively studied as SERS substrates, the availability of other types of substrates is currently expanding the applications of this spectroscopic method. Recently, researchers have begun exploring two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., graphene&#8208;like nanostructures) as substrates for SERS analysis. These materials offer unique optical properties, a well&#8208;defined structure, and the ability to modify their surface chemistry. As a contribution to advance this field, this concept article highlights the significance of understanding the chemical mechanism that underlies the experimental Raman spectra of chemisorbed molecules onto 2D materials&#8217; surfaces. Therefore, the article discusses recent advancements in fabricating substrates using 2D layered materials and the synergic effects of using their metallic composites for SERS applications. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on using Raman imaging in developing 2D materials as analytical platforms for Raman spectroscopy, an exciting emerging research area with significant potential.</dc:description>

Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and quantum chemical bond analysis of the Ti and Zr complexes reveal ligand influence on the biradicaloid character of the titanocene complexes. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy of structurally similar Ti complexes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)Ti(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] (2a), 2b, and 2c was carried out to evaluate the accessibility of an EPR active triplet state. Cyclic voltammetry shows that introduction of Ph groups renders the complexes easier to reduce. 13C CPMAS NMR analysis provides insights into the cause of the low field shift of the resonances of metal&#8208;bonded carbon atoms and provides evidence of the absence of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Ti interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating Electron Transfer by Resizing Cyclocarbon Acceptor from C18 to C16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in synthetic methods, combined with tip&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface chemistry, have enabled the formation of numerous cyclocarbon molecules. Here, we investigate computationally the experimentally studied C16 and C18 molecules as well as their van der Waals (vdW) complexes with several typical donor and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate a remarkable electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of cyclocarbon molecules. The vdW complexes of C16 and C18 exhibit a thermodynamically favorable photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor partner to the cyclocarbons that occurs on a picosecond time scale. The lower reorganization energy of C16 compared to C18 leads to a significant acceleration of the ET reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Ionic Ir(III) Cyclometalated Complexes as Photocatalysts for Light Assisted ATRP of MMA. A Combined Experimental and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of ionic Ir(III)&#8208;complexes was designed, prepared and assessed for the visible light assisted ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA). A complete experimental and mechanistic study is performed to shed light on the key factors for the proper control of the polymerization process.







Abstract
A new family of ionic Ir(III) cyclometalated complexes with general formula [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br], was designed and prepared to be assessed as photocalysts for the visible light assisted ATRP polymerization of MMA. To this purpose, our design strategy involved both: i) the decoration of the cyclometalating (CN) and the ancillary (NN) ligands with various electron withdrawing and/or electron donor substituents and, ii) the use of Br&#8722; as the counter anion for these cationic Ir(III) species. After an extensive screening in which the [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br]&#8208;type compounds were compared to the model neutral complex fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3], the &#8220;fully&#8221; amino&#8208;substituted ion pairs abbreviated as [10][Br] and [11][Br], exhibited the best photocatalytic performances under irradiation with CFL lamps. It is worth noting that the outcomes of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments combined with theoretical DFT calculations, enlightened the role played by the Ir(III) complexes in the mechanism of the photoATRP process, and suggested the rationalization of the different performances that were highlighted by our Ir(III) catalyst in the visible light assisted photopolymerization of MMA.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Multicatalytic Cerium Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Cleavage of O&#8722;H Bearing Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach toward general &#946; C&#8722;C bond scission reactions of carboxylic acids and hemiacetals is presented. The present work demonstrates the power of a multicatalytic cerium&#8208;based photoredox platform to enable direct hydrodecarboxylation of carboxylic acids as well as redox&#8208;neutral ring cleavage of lactol derivatives.







Abstract
The need for synthetic methodologies capable of rapidly altering molecular structure are in high demand. Most existing methods to modify scaffolds rely on net exothermicity to drive the desired transformation. We sought to develop a general strategy for the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds &#946; to hydroxyl groups independent of inherent substrate strain. To this end we have applied a multicatalytic cerium photoredox&#8208;based system capable of activating O&#8722;H bonds in lactols to deliver formate esters. The same system is also capable of effecting hydrodecarboxylation and hydrodecarbonylation reactions. Initial mechanistic probes demonstrate atomic chlorine (Cl&#8901;) is generated under the reaction conditions, but substrate activation through cerium&#8208;alkoxides or &#8208;carboxylates cannot be ruled out.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Discharge Processes of Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article elucidates the significant factors affecting discharge intermediates and reaction pathways of the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries and highlights a *Li2O&#8208;mediated surface lithiation mechanism.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries facilitate renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, particularly in terms of the theoretical aspect. First, the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates are highlighted, and a surface lithiation mechanism predominantly applicable to catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption is proposed. Subsequently, the modeling of the chemical potential of Li++e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage, is detailed. Finally, challenges and future directions pertaining to the further development of Li&#8722;CO2 are discussed. In essence, this concept article seeks to inspire future experimental and theoretical studies in advancing the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method has been developed for the fabrication of gradient&#8208;structured actuators with cross&#8208;link variation by using two distinct photoinitiator systems to selectively trigger thiol&#8208;ene polymerization and acrylate homopolymerization. The gradient&#8208;structured actuator undergoes bending deformation in both air and solvent environments, and can be controlled by carefully tailoring the photopolymerization conditions.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have recently gained significant attention in the field of soft robotics, sensors, and biomimetic devices. The most facile way for the fabrication of such materials remains to endow bilayer structures which are fabricated with the combination of active and passive layers. Although, easily fabricated, these structures suffer from the generation of stress points between connection areas. In this work we develop a method to create a thin film with controlled cross&#8208;link variation across its thickness. The cross&#8208;link gradient is achieved through polymerization induced diffusion of dithiol molecules in thiol&#8208;ene network. As a result, the film exhibits bending deformation upon illumination with light or exposure to a chemical solvent, thereby demonstrating dual responsiveness. Light actuation of the film is achieved via photothermal effects due to the incorporation of dye into the system which can absorb UV light and heat the network. While solvent induced actuation is due to anisotropic swelling. Furthermore, the straightforward fabrication procedure allows for the creation of more complex deformations by patterning the film using a photomask during photopolymerization.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A density functional theory study of the ScIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation of ketones with diazo compounds unveils a novel substrate coordination mode driven by the trans influence of counterions. This sheds light on the origins of the stereoselectivity and suggests a new strategy for adjusting it. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Huang, Y.&#8208;D. Wu, and X. Zhang (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303873).

         <title>Targeting of G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug development strategy: Re and 99mTc tricarbonyl complexes with a pyridostatin moiety as a G4&#8208;binding motif have been obtained through a post&#8208;conjugation strategy using Pz&#8208;COOH&#8208;M. Metalation was found to enhance the complexes&#8217; cytotoxicity in two cancer cell lines; the 99mTc congener was used to study binding and internalization. Possible uses of the complexes for DNA&#8208;interaction, cell and biodistribution studies are illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Palma, A. Paulo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400285).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we conduct extensive high&#8208;pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt&#8208;nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, first&#8208;principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high&#8208;pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs&#8208;type CoN, and marcasite&#8208;type CoN2 within the pressure range of 50&#8208;90 GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co3N2, Pnma&#8208;CoN and two polynitrides, CoN3 and CoN5, within the pressure range of 90&#8208;120 GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN3 feature branched&#8208;type nitrogen trimers (N3) and CoN5 show &#960;&#8208;bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN6 polyhedral frameworks transit from face&#8208;sharing (in CoN) to edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and finally to isolated (in CoN5).

         <title>N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Sulfurdiimides are Strongly Redox Tuned</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 4&#8208; and 2,4,6&#8208;substituted diaryl sulfur diimides induce a large dependence on redox properties, such as the one&#8208;electron reduction CV waves shown here, that correlate linearly with the redox MO energies. One&#8208;electron transfers are confirmed using in&#8197;situ EPR spectroscopy, identifying radical anions that have longer lifetimes the more electron withdrawing the substituents.







Abstract
The synthesis and extensive characterization of nine aryl sulfur diimides (SDIs, Ar&#8722;NSN&#8722;Ar) are presented with a robust computational and experimental investigation of the fundamental properties of these important members of the thiazyl family of compounds, with particular attention paid to their highly tunable electrochemical behaviour. This is the first work to undertake a systematic comparison of the electrochemical profiles of a coherent series of SDIs to demonstrate and quantify the response of their reduction potentials to substituent electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing properties. This effect is found to be not only exceptionally strong, but also correlates very closely with computed orbital energies. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to determine the nature, localization, and qualitative lifetimes of the radical anions of SDIs. This work also addresses significant misconceptions about physical properties of SDIs. Experimental data and modern computational methods are employed to provide a resolute answer to the long&#8208;standing contention of the solution&#8208;state conformations of SDIs, and to correct historical mistakes in the assignment of infrared spectroscopic data. High&#8208;quality crystal structures of all SDIs in this work showcase the utility of the recently introduced structural refinement software NoSpherA2, enabling full anisotropic refinement of H&#8208;atoms with accurate C&#8722;H bond lengths.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Self&#8208;Supported Ge Anode for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode with enlarged surface area, enough spacing, and the shortened ions/electrons transporting path length would greatly facilitate the rapid kinetics and promote more Li ions reversibly stored in the Ge electrode during cycling, thus embrace improved energy&amp;power density and cyclability. This review highlights various strategies of constructing the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode and provides future perspectives.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high&#8208;performance binder&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shortened ions/electrons transporting distance of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode would be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge&#8208;based electrodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Bimodal use of chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers: study of the position impact towards the helical screw&#8208;sense preference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of a chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine residue into Aib oligomers proved its effectiveness as a bimodal moiety, acting both as controller and 19F NMR reporter of the helical screw&#8208;sense preference. By varying its position along the chain and the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping, our study revealed the stereoelectronic properties of the CF3 group enabling the control of the helical conformation.







Abstract
Oligomers of the achiral &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) adopt a 310 helical conformation in which the screw&#8208;sense preference can be controlled by a single chiral residue. The use of the fluorinated residue &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw&#8208;sense preference of such oligomers acting as 19F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw&#8208;sense preference of poly&#8208;Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (N&#8208;terminal, central or C&#8208;terminal) as well as the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &#945;&#8208;TfmAla as a helical screw&#8208;sense controller.

The use of the fluorinated residue &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Trifluoromethylalanine (&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw-sense preference of such oligomers acting as &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw-sense preference of poly-Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal, central or &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal) as well as the nature of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-TfmAla as a helical screw-sense controller.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Phenyl Transfer from a Boronate to Lithium in the Gas Phase Reveals Crucial Role of Solvation in Transmetalations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to common belief, transmetalation reactions are not simply controlled by the electronegativity difference of the involved metals/metalloids. A combination of gas&#8208;phase and solution experiments, together with quantum chemical calculations, reveals the crucial role of solvation in the transmetalation from lithium to boron. Only in the presence of solvent molecules, the reaction proceeds in the expected direction, whereas the formation of the organolithium compound is favored in the gas phase.







Abstract
In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; (pin=pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids. Instead, the individual coordination states and their changes over the course of the reaction must be taken into account.

         <title>Designing Powerful Biindole&#8208;Based Inherently Chiral Selectors: Enhancing Enantiodiscrimination by Core Functionalization with Additional Coordination Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a further coordination element to biindole&#8208;based inherent chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, by exploiting their peculiar advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms in the atropisomeric core, can powerfully enhance their remarkable enantiodiscrimination performances, as shown by tests with both model ferrocenyl and NSAIDs chiral probes.







Abstract
Among inherently chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, usually resulting in very good enantiodiscrimination performances, the biindole&#8208;based family has the additional advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms with a variety of substituents with desirable properties. Aiming to evaluate the possibility of exploiting such feature to enhance the enantiodiscrimination ability of the archetype structure, a series of three inherently chiral monomers were designed and synthesized, characterised by a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric core conjugated to bithiophene wings enabling fast and regular electrooligomerization, and functionalised at the nitrogen atoms with an ethyl, a methoxyethyl, or a hydroxyethyl substituent. Nitrogen alkylation was also exploited to obtain for the first time the chemical resolution of the biindole selectors without employing chiral HPLC. The enantiodiscrimination ability of the selector series was comparatively evaluated in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept chiral voltammetry experiments with a &#8220;benchmark&#8221; chiral ferrocenyl probe as well as with chiral non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs naproxen and ketoprofen. The large enantiomer potential differences for all probes increased in the ethyl &lt; methoxyethyl &#8810; hydroxyethyl sequence of selector substituents, supporting our assumption on the beneficial role of an additional coordination element. The powerful hydroxyethyl selector was also applied to ketoprofen in a commercial drug matrix.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Nano&#8208;Reservoir for Room Temperature RNA Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been studied for room&#8208;temperature storage of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs). The RNAs loaded in COFs maintained their structural integrity when stored in ambient conditions for weeks and were found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation in the presence of RNase.







Abstract
The emerging role of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as therapeutics is alluring. However, RNAs are extremely labile under ambient conditions and typically need to be stored in cryogenic conditions (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Hence, storage, stabilization, and transportation of RNA under ambient conditions have been an arduous task and remain an unsolved problem. In this work, a guanidinium&#8208;based ionic covalent organic framework (COF), TTGCl with nanotubular morphology, was synthesized and used as nano&#8208;reservoirs for room&#8208;temperature storage of RNA. To understand the role of the nanotubular morphology and chemical nature of TTGCl in stabilizing the RNA structure and for comparison purposes, a neutral COF, TMT&#8208;TT, is synthesized and studied. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed non&#8208;covalent interaction between the COFs and the RNA nucleobases, facilitating reversible storage of RNA. RNA loaded in COFs was found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation when treated with RNase. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the structural integrity of the recovered RNAs and their further processibility.

         <title>Remote Fluorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls via Silyl Dienol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general, regioselective, and metal free &#947;&#8208;fluorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls via silyl dienol ethers that are readily prepared from simple ketones and aldehydes. The transformation displays broad scope including 27 cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes providing &#947;&#8208;fluoro compounds in 28&#8211;91&#8201;% yield. Notably, the reported conditions are also suitable for the synthesis of challenging tertiary fluorides. The regioselectivity of the reaction was studied on a series of acyclic siloxydienes and was observed to be sensitive to the conformational flexibility of the substrate. Diversification of the &#947;&#8208;fluorocarbonyls demonstrates the promise of fluorine as a stereocontrol element.

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of perfect polar dipole alignment in ferroelectric lattices of organic non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) materials demonstrates the potential for crystal engineering by rational design to craft materials with advanced optical performance. The methoxyphenyl series of acetophenone azines feature polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). These third&#8208;generation chromophores feature superior triple T&#8208;contacts and improved crystal growth, and they excel because of their enhanced NLO properties.







Abstract
An improved design is described for ferroelectric crystals and implemented with the &#8220;methoxyphenyl series&#8221; of acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines with Y=F (1), Cl (2), Br (3), or I (4). The crystal structures of these azines exhibit polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). Azines 1, 3, and 4 form true racemates whereas chloroazine 2 crystallizes as a kryptoracemate. Azines 1&#8211;4 are helical because of the N&#8722;N bond conformation. In true racemates the molecules of opposite helicity (M and P) are enantiomers A(M) and A*(P) while in kryptoracemates they are diastereomers A(M) and B*(P). The stacking mode of PBAMs is influenced by halogen bonding, with 2&#8211;4 showcasing a kink due to directional interlayer halogen bonding, whereas fluoroazine 1 demonstrates ideal polar stacking by avoiding it. Notably, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines display a stronger bias for dipole parallel alignment, attributed to the linearity of the biphenyl moiety as compared to the phenoxy series of (PhO, Y)&#8208;azines with their non&#8208;linear Ph&#8722;O&#8722;Ph moiety. The crystals of 1&#8211;4 all feature planar biphenyls and this synthon facilitates their crystallization through potent triple T&#8208;contacts and enhances their nonlinear optical (NLO) performance by increasing conjugation length and affecting favorable chromophore conformations in the solids.

     alt="Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The achievement of perfect polar dipole alignment in ferroelectric lattices of organic non-linear optical (NLO) materials demonstrates the potential for crystal engineering by rational design to craft materials with advanced optical performance. The methoxyphenyl series of acetophenone azines feature polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). These third-generation chromophores feature superior triple T-contacts and improved crystal growth, and they excel because of their enhanced NLO properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An improved design is described for ferroelectric crystals and implemented with the &#8220;methoxyphenyl series&#8221; of acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)-azines with Y=F (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Cl (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), Br (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), or I (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). The crystal structures of these azines exhibit polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). Azines &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; form true racemates whereas chloroazine &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; crystallizes as a kryptoracemate. Azines &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;4&lt;/b&gt; are helical because of the N&#8722;N bond conformation. In true racemates the molecules of opposite helicity (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) are enantiomers &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;*(&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) while in kryptoracemates they are diastereomers &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;*(&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;). The stacking mode of PBAMs is influenced by halogen bonding, with &lt;b&gt;2&#8211;4&lt;/b&gt; showcasing a kink due to directional &lt;i&gt;inter&lt;/i&gt;layer halogen bonding, whereas fluoroazine &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates ideal polar stacking by avoiding it. Notably, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)-azines display a stronger bias for dipole parallel alignment, attributed to the linearity of the biphenyl moiety as compared to the phenoxy series of (PhO, Y)-azines with their non-linear Ph&#8722;O&#8722;Ph moiety.

         <title>Phenanthrothiophene&#8208;Triazine Star&#8208;Shaped Discotic Liquid Crystals: Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazine&#8208;based mesogens with three pending discoid arms have been shown to self&#8208;organize into rectangular columnar mesophases and form gels in various solvents. The solvatochromic&#8208;, acidochromic&#8208; and metal recognition&#8208;response photoluminescence of these mesogens offer applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting and as selective metal&#8208;ion recognition.







Abstract
Lipophilic biphenylthiophene&#8208; and phenanthrothiophene&#8208;triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn, respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent's polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON&#8208;OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self&#8208;assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0&#8197;mg/mL). Therefore, these star&#8208;shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.

A facile and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component reaction has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminonaphthothiazoles from 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes, elemental sulfur, and amines. This photochemical transformation can be conducted under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst to afford various naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines in moderate to excellent yields by using air as a green oxidant.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy has been explored for the synthesis of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines through ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H sulfuration of 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes with elemental sulfur and amines under external photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component reaction, which utilizes elemental sulfur as the odorless sulfur source, molecular oxygen as the clean oxidant, and visible light as the clean energy source, provides a mild and efficient approach to construct a series of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photoexcitation of reaction intermediates consisting of thioureas and DBU might be involved in this transformation.
