         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Mesoporous Copper(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Remediation of Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clean water act: Copper(II) MOFs with linkers derived from 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridine have been synthesized, and their crystal structures have been determined. One of the MOFs was found to be mesoporous and highly active in the remediation of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, in which cationic dyes could be removed by adsorption while anionic dyes could be degraded by using the MOF as a catalyst under visible light.







Abstract
By using tritopic and ditopic organic linkers derived from the same 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridine core, copper(II) metal&#8208;organic frameworks with different three&#8208;dimensional structures have been successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. The crystalline framework, PTBMOF ([Cu3(PTB)2(H2O)3]n, where H3PTB=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzoic acid, was observed to be mesoporous in nature and exhibited dual functionality in the removal of organic dyes. While cationic dyes such as methylene blue and malachite green, which are of different sizes, were adsorbed by PTBMOF; anionic dyes such as tartrazine could be effectively degraded in a photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction catalyzed by the MOFs under irradiation with visible light.

         <title>Photo&#8208;/Electroinduced Irreversible Isomerization of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Azobispyridine Ligands in Arene Ruthenium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One shot switch in response to light or electrochemical stimuli of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobispyridine involved in a 7&#8208;membered chelate ring with a RuII metal center is disclosed. The molecular pathways at work in the course of this transformation were investigated by a combination of analytical and computational techniques, thereby providing a rational for the efficient and irreversible nature of the process.







Abstract
Novel arene RuII complexes containing 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobispyridine ligands were synthesized and characterized by using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, electrochemistry, DFT calculations and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Z&#8208;configured complexes featuring unprecedented seven&#8208;membered chelate rings involving the nitrogen atom of both pyridines were isolated and were shown to undergo irreversible isomerization to the corresponding E&#8208;configured five&#8208;membered chelate complexes in response to light or electrochemical stimulus.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Spiro&#8208;double Sila[7]helicene: The LUMO Spiro&#8208;conjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;double sila[7]helicene was synthesized through four successive nucleophilic substitutions on silicon atom. The two helicene units were symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. Delocalization of the LUMO orbital through the spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety lowered the LUMO energy, red&#8208;shifted the emission spectra, and enhanced polarization in the absorption.







Abstract
A double helicene with a spiro&#8208;Si linker (4) was synthesized by four successive nucleophilic substitutions on SiCl4. Its (P,P), (M,M) and (P,M) isomers were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the central spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety, the two helicene units in 4 are symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. (P,P)&#8208;4 and (M,M)&#8208;4 exhibit unique optical properties attributable to the LUMO spiro&#8208;conjugation between the two sila[7]helicene units.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Ligand and its Corresponding Copper Complex for the Development of Electrochemical Affinity Biosensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful alternative for biomolecule labelling, based on the electrochemical properties of a metallic complex, is presented. A bis&#8208;triazole ligand and its corresponding copper complex were synthesized and characterized. The coupling of the copper complex with an aptamer was realized and confirmed by mass spectroscopy analysis. The labelled aptamer was then immobilized on a screen&#8208;printed carbon electrode for the design of an estradiol aptasensor.







Abstract
The bis&#8208;triazole ligand and its corresponding copper complexes were synthesized and characterized for the first time and proposed as new labels for the development of electrochemical aptasensors. The bis&#8208;triazole ligand was prepared from methyl 1,6&#8208;heptadiyne&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(azidomethyl)phenol using classical CuAAC in presence of different copper salts. The X&#8208;ray structure of bis&#8208;triazole showed a symmetry center (C1). UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;band EPR spectra showed that the coordination capacity of the bis&#8208;triazole ligand was improved in the presence of triethylamine due to deprotonation of the triazole and phenolate moieties. After complexation with copper, the obtained complex was successfully attached to an anti&#8208;estradiol aptamer through thiol&#8208;maleimide coupling, and the resulting labelled aptamer was immobilized on a carbon screen&#8208;printed electrode by carbodiimide coupling. The electrochemical response of the resulting sensor was shown to decrease in the presence of estradiol, demonstrating that the developed complexes can be applied for the development of aptasensors.

         <title>Cerium Doping Double Perovskite Scintillator for Sensitive X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cerium&#8208;ion doped lead&#8208;free double perovskite crystals (Cs2NaTbCl6), were found to have significantly improved sensitivity and the double perovskite crystals (Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6) showed excellent ability to resist X&#8208;ray radiation damage. In addition the composite film of Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6 crystals can reach a detection limit of 30&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 of X&#8208;ray detector, with the capability to clearly distinguishing the spatial resolution of 10&#8197;lp/mm.







Abstract
Scintillators are widely used for nondestructive testing, nuclear medicine imaging, space exploration and security inspection. Recently, lead halide perovskite scintillation crystals have been brought into focus due to their effective atomic number, fast scintillation decay time, strong luminous efficiency, and tunable band gap. However, their application is limited by lead toxicity. Here we report that Ce&#8208;doping can increase sensitivity in lead&#8208;free double perovskite crystals (Cs2NaTbCl6) for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. The introduction of Ce ions as sensitizer can be used to improve the radioluminescence of the crystals. The light output of Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6 crystals is about 52153&#8197;ph/MeV, which is 25&#8201;% higher than that of un&#8208;doped crystal. The X&#8208;ray sensitivity is significantly enhanced. Based on our scintillation film X&#8208;ray detector the detection limit is 30&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is about 1/183 of the typical medical imaging dose. Our scintillating film has excellent imaging ability with spatial resolution of up to 10&#8197;lp/mm. This research shows that Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6 perovskite crystal scintillators are promising materials for X&#8208;ray imaging application.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cerium-ion doped&lt;/b&gt; lead-free double perovskite crystals (Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaTbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), were found to have significantly improved sensitivity and the double perovskite crystals (Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaTbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) showed excellent ability to resist X-ray radiation damage. In addition the composite film of Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaTbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; crystals can reach a detection limit of 30&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of X-ray detector, with the capability to clearly distinguishing the spatial resolution of 10&#8197;lp/mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scintillators are widely used for nondestructive testing, nuclear medicine imaging, space exploration and security inspection. Recently, lead halide perovskite scintillation crystals have been brought into focus due to their effective atomic number, fast scintillation decay time, strong luminous efficiency, and tunable band gap. However, their application is limited by lead toxicity. Here we report that Ce-doping can increase sensitivity in lead-free double perovskite crystals (Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaTbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) for X-ray detection and imaging. The introduction of Ce ions as sensitizer can be used to improve the radioluminescence of the crystals. The light output of Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaTbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; crystals is about 52153&#8197;ph/MeV, which is 25&#8201;% higher than that of un-doped crystal. The X-ray sensitivity is significantly enhanced. Based on our scintillation film X-ray detector the detection limit is 30&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is about 1/183 of the typical medical imaging dose. Our scintillating film has excellent imaging ability with spatial resolution of up to 10&#8197;lp/mm. This research shows that Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaTbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite crystal scintillators are promising materials for X-ray imaging application.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Using the Interaction between Copper and Manganese to Stabilize Copper Single&#8208;atom for CO Oxidation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting the SAC: Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts have been prepared by the metal&#8208;support interaction that forms the Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Mn entity. This not only stabilizes Cu single atoms, but also promotes CO oxidation by increasing active oxygen species and by the active center participating in the catalytic reaction. The catalyst can maintain CO conversion of 95&#8201;% after 15 cycles.







Abstract
The interaction between Cu and Mn has been used to immobilize the Cu single&#8208;atom on MnO2 surface by redox&#8208;driven hydrolysis. Comprehensive structure and property characterizations demonstrate that the existence of an Cu&#8722;Mn interaction on the catalyst surface can effectively restrain the aggregation of Cu single atoms and improve carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation activity. The interaction of forming the Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Mn entity is beneficial for CO catalytic activity as the migration of reactive oxygen species and the coordination effect of active centers accelerate the reaction. In particular, 3%&#8208;Cu1/MnO2 shows an oxygen storage capacity (OSC) value (342.75&#8197;&#956;mol/g) more than ten times that of pure MnO2 (27.79&#8197;&#956;mol/g) and has high CO catalytic activity (T90%=80&#8201;&#176;C), it can maintain CO conversion of 95&#8201;% after 15 cycles. This work offers a reliable method for synthesizing Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts and deepens understanding of the interaction effect between single transition metal atoms and supports that can improve the catalytic activity of CO oxidation.

         <title>Porous Organic Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Polymer as an Efficient Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Direct Aromatic C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed and constructed a porous phenanthroline&#8208;based polymer (namely POP&#8208;Phen) via free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized phenanthroline monomers. The resultant POP&#8208;Phen has a high surface area, abundant and permanent porosity, is excellently thermal and has a high concentration of organic ligands. POP&#8208;Phen shows excellent catalytic performance in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, even better than the corresponding homogeneous catalyst. This is mainly attributed to the high density of catalytically active sites in the heterogeneous catalyst.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H bond transformation has been regarded as one of the most important areas in organic synthesis in both academia and industry. However, the heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysis of direct C&#8722;H bond transformation has remained a contemporary challenge. To tackle this challenge, we designed and constructed a porous phenanthroline&#8208;based polymer (namely POP&#8208;Phen) via free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized phenanthroline monomers. POP&#8208;Phen shows excellent catalytic performances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, even better than those of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst, which is mainly attributed to the high density of catalytically active sites in the heterogeneous catalyst. Kinetic isotope experiments and spectral characterizations demonstrate the electron&#8208;transfer between the heterogeneous catalyst and the base (t&#8208;BuOK), a key step for C&#8722;H activation. We believe that this porous organic phenanthroline polymer could open a new door for the design of novel heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts for direct C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Theoretical Simulations of Thermochromic and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Behaviors of a Series of Red&#8208;Light Anthracene&#8208;o&#8208;carborane Derivatives</title>

When the heat is on: A series of anthracene&#8208;o&#8208;carborane derivatives with red&#8208;light aggregation&#8208;induced emission has been studied theoretically. The changes in bond length and dihedral angle result from alteration of the crystal stacking structure after heating, and the thermochromic behavior in crystal is ascribed to the elongation of bond length.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out on a series of anthracene&#8208;o&#8208;carborane derivatives (ANT&#8208;H, ANT&#8208;Ph, ANT&#8208;Me and ANT&#8208;TMS) with rare red&#8208;light emission in the solid state. The simulation of the heating process of the crystals and further comparison of the molecular structures and excited&#8208;state properties before and after heating help us to disclose the thermochromic behavior, that is, the red&#8208;shift emission is caused by elongation of the C1&#8722;C2 bond in the carborane moiety after heating. Thus, we believe that the molecular structure in the crystal is severely affected by heating. Transformation of the molecular conformation appears in the ANT&#8208;H crystal with increasing temperature. More specifically, the anthracene moiety moves from nearly parallel to the C1&#8722;C2 bond to nearly perpendicular, causing the short&#8208;wavelength emission to disappear after heating. As for the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomenon, the structures and photophysical properties were investigated comparatively in both the isolated and crystal states; the results suggested that the energy dissipation in crystal surroundings was greatly reduced through hindering structure relaxation from the excited to the ground state. We expect that discussion of the thermochromic behavior will provide a new analysis perspective for the molecular design of o&#8208;carborane derivatives.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Generated Trimetallic Molybdate Nanoflowers on Ni Foam Assisted with Microwave for Highly Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trimetallic Ni0.90Al0.10MoO4 nanoflowers in&#8208;situ grown on the conductive substrate of Ni foam were synthetized for highly enhanced OER. The optimal Ni0.9Al0.1MoO4&#8208;NF requires an overpotential of 266&#8197;mV for OER at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which outperforms commercial RuO2 catalysts (274&#8197;mV). The doping of Al contributes to effectively regulating the electronic structure of Ni centers in NiMoO4 and greatly reduces the hydrogen adsorption free energy, consequently improving the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered as a critical half&#8208;cell reaction of water splitting, the kinetics of which is sluggish even not favored, thus requiring highly active electrocatalysts to shrink the reaction energy barrier and improve the energy conversion efficiency. In this study, In&#8208;situ generated trimetallic molybdate nanoflowers on Ni foam by a straightforward and time&#8208;saving solvothermal method assisted with microwave, not only bring synergistic effect into full play between multiple metals, but also construct a well&#8208;defined nanoflower&#8208;like structure accompanied by larger specific area (273.3&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and smaller size than the pristine NiMoO4. The resulting Ni0.9Al0.1MoO4&#8208;NF requires a relatively low overpotential of 266&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which outperforms commercial RuO2 catalysts (274&#8197;mV). Such excellent performance compares favorably to most previously reported NiMoO4&#8208;based electrocatalysts for OER. This work not only supplies a facile method to construct a well&#8208;defined nanoflower&#8208;like structure on foam, but also broadens our horizons into the mechanism of OER in alkaline conditions.

The resulting Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NF requires a relatively low overpotential of 266&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which outperforms commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts (274&#8197;mV). Such excellent performance compares favorably to most previously reported NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrocatalysts for OER. This work not only supplies a facile method to construct a well-defined nanoflower-like structure on foam, but also broadens our horizons into the mechanism of OER in alkaline conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multifunctional Materials Serving as Efficient Non&#8208;Doped Violet&#8208;Blue Emitters and Host Materials for Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;doped device based on TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF as emitter exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 6.76&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) of (0.152, 0.059). As host material, the green, yellow, and red phosphorescent OLEDs obtained high EQEmax of about 20&#8201;% and both devices exhibited low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Efficient multifunctional materials acting as violet&#8208;blue emitters, as well as host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs, are crucial but rare due to demand that they should have high first singlet state (S1) energy and first triplet state (T1) energy simultaneously. In this study, two new violet&#8208;blue bipolar fluorophores, TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF and SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF, were designed and synthesized by introducing the hole transporting moiety triphenylamine (TPA) and spirobifluorene (SBF) unit that has high T1 into high deep blue emission quantum yield group phenanthroimidazole (PI). As the results, the non&#8208;doped OLEDs based on TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF exhibited excellent EL performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 6.76&#8201;% and a violet&#8208;blue emission with Commission Internationale de L&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) of (0.152, 0.059). The device based on SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF displayed EQEmax of 6.19&#8201;% with CIE of (0.159, 0.049), which nearly matches the CIE coordinates of the violet&#8208;blue emitters standard of (0.131, 0.046). These EL performances are comparable to the best reported non&#8208;doped deep or violet&#8208;blue emissive OLEDs with CIEy&lt;0.06 in recent years. Additionally, the green, yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF and SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF as host materials achieved a high EQEmax of about 20&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off at the ultra&#8208;high luminance of 10 000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These results provided a new construction strategy for designing high&#8208;performance violet&#8208;blue emitters, as well as efficient host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs.

         <title>Molecular Disorder Induces an Unusual Phase Transition in a Potential 2D Chiral Ferroelectric Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D chiral hybrid halide ferroelectric perovskite, [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2CdCl4 (4PBA&#8722;CdCl4) experiences two continuous phase transitions from a centrosymmetric triclinic P
 to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar chiral monoclinic P2 to another centrosymmetric tetragonal P4/mmm with increasing temperature. In particularly, 4PBA&#8722;CdCl4 has a significant CD signal and a moderate ferroelectric polarization value of 0.35&#8197;&#956;C/cm2.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional hybrid halide perovskites with single chiral and ferroelectricity together with various structural phase transitions provide the possibility for more diverse functional properties. Here, we present a 2D chiral hybrid halide perovskite ferroelectric, [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2CdCl4 (4PBA&#8722;CdCl4, 4PBA=4&#8208;phenylbutylamine) that experiences two continuous phase transitions from centrosymmetric triclinic P
 to polar chiral monoclinic P2 and then to another centrosymmetric tetragonal P4/mmm with increasing temperature, accompanied by symmetry breaking, due to the prominent octahedral distortion and disorder transformation of organic 4PBA cations. In the polar chiral phase, 4PBA&#8722;CdCl4 gives a significant CD signal and has a moderate ferroelectric polarization of 0.35&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. In addition, 4PBA&#8722;CdCl4 occupies a wide band gap of 4.376&#8197;eV that is chiefly contributed by the inorganic CdCl6 octahedron. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new phase transitions and related physical properties in hybrid halide perovskites and other hybrid crystals.

         <title>Validation of Ab&#8208;Initio&#8208;Predicted Magnetic Anisotropies and Magneto&#8208;structural Correlations in Linear Hetero&#8208;trinuclear DyIII&#8208;NiII2 Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discussed is a linear trinuclear DyIIINiII2 complex with a rare hexacoordinate DyIII center. The magnetic properties were studied experimentally by single crystal SQUID magnetometry, single crystal high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy. Parameters describing the ground state multiplet splitting have also been computed by ab&#8208;initio quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, and the large variety of experimental techniques allows for a thorough validation of the computational analysis.







Abstract
Reported are single crystal SQUID and single crystal high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR data of a trinuclear complex with a rare six&#8208;coordinate coordination sphere of a DyIII center coupled to two terminal six&#8208;coordinate NiII ions. The analysis of the single crystal spectroscopic parameters allows for an accurate description of the ground state wavefunction. The experimental analysis is supplemented by the analysis of the paramagnetic NMR spectra, allowing for a thorough description of the DyIII center. The experimental data are interpreted on the basis of an ab initio ligand field analysis, and the computed parameters are in good agreement with the experimental observations. This supports the quality of the theoretical approach based on a pseudo&#8208;spin Hamiltonian for the electronic ground state. Further support emerges from the ab initio ligand field theory based analysis of a structurally very similar system that, in contrast to the complex reported here, shows single molecule magnetic properties, and this is in agreement with the quantum&#8208;chemical prediction and analysis.

         <dc:description>We have developed a widely applicable approach to synthesize ketones, esters, amides via the oxidative C&#8208;C bond cleavage of readily available alkyl aldehydes. Green and abundant molecular oxygen (O  2  ) was used as the oxidant, and base metals (cobalt and copper) were used as the catalysts. This strategy can be extended to the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ketones from primary alcohols and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides from aldehydes.</dc:description>

&#8220;The preparation of novel hole transporting materials able to compete with the reference spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, has been a hot topic in photovoltaics in the last years. In the present paper, we have proposed a new design principle for the preparation of hole transporting materials for perovskite solar cells. Our approach relies on the functionalization of a clickable pillar[5]arene core with peripheral triarylamines to generate dendrimer&#8208;like structures.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Fabrication of Pd/Mg2P2O7 via a Struvite&#8208;template Way from Wastewater and Application as Chemoselective Catalyst in Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst Pd/ Mg  2  P  2  O  7&#160;  was fabricated by combining palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and mesoporous Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers/rods. The Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers with ultra high specific surface area were prepared from struvite as templates which were synthesized from wastewater consisting of N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing pollutants. This strategy provided a novel pathway in developing advanced catalysts from eutrophication polluted water. The composite Pd/Mg  2  P  2  O  7  showed brilliant performance in selective hydrogenation of nitro&#8208;aromatics to get anilines. As an example of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, the conversion and selectivity to aniline were found to reach almost 100% at temperature of T=90&#176;C and under pressure of P  H2  =2.0 MPa. The superior performance was found to originate from Pd NPs which were boosted by electron transfer afforded by the nano&#8208;fibers Mg  2  P  2  O  7  supports. The favorable adsorption of withdrawing groups (&#8208;NO  2  ) was realized by synergistic effects between Pd and oxygen vacancies provided by pyrolysis of struvite. The catalyst remained stably after cycles of reuse with little degradation in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Electrophilic Fluorinating Reagents for Highly Selective Mono&#8208; and Difluorination of Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds have been intensively studied, recently. Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as  N  &#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base&#8208;free conditions. Thus, both mono&#8208; and difluorinated target materials were prepared from the same substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;derived 1&#8208;D Carbon Nanofiber Architecture with Simultaneous Decoration of Single Fe&#8208;Nx Sites and Fe/Fe3C Nanoparticles for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, we report a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) carbon nanofiber architecture with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8208;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the Fe(III) complex assisted&#8208;electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of Fe(III) complex enables the 1&#8208;D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1&#8208;D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8208;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885 V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7 mW cm&#8208;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery. This work opens a path for the design and synthesis of 1&#8208;D carbon electrocatalyst for efficient ORR catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Affinity Selections of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries on Carbonic Anhydrase IX&#8208;Expressing Tumor Cells Reveal a Dependence on Ligand Valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries were screened against live cells, first in a model system to apply systematically optimized conditions using a library comprising 1 million members. Both, selection conditions and bivalent ligand display had a crucial impact on the success of cell&#8208;based selections.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries are typically screened against purified protein targets. Recently, cell&#8208;based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code&#8208;specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15&#8208;fold enrichment factors for high&#8208;affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; KD=8.7&#8197;nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100&#8208;fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor&#8208;associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.

         <title>Rethinking Borole Cycloaddition Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boroles are attracting broad interest for their myriad and diverse applications, including in synthesis, small&#8208;molecule activation and functional materials. Their properties and reactivity are closely linked to the cyclic conjugated diene system, which has been shown to participate in cycloaddition reactions, such as the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with alkynes. The reaction steps leading to boranorbornadienes, borepins and tricyclic boracyclohexenes from the thermal reaction of boroles with alkynes are seemingly well understood as judged from the literature. Herein, we question the long&#8208;established mechanistic picture of pericyclic rearrangements by demonstrating that seven&#8208;membered borepins (i.e. heptaphenylborepin and two derivatives substituted with a thienyl and chloride substituent on boron) exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding bicyclic boranorbornadienes, the direct Diels&#8208;Alder products, but are not isolable products from the reactions. Heating gradually converts the isomeric mixtures into fluorescent tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers in the series. Results from mechanistic DFT calculations reveal that the tricyclic compounds derive from the boranorbornadienes and not the borepins, which were previously believed to be intermediates in purely pericyclic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Tetrazine&#8208;based Pincer Ligand for the Reduction of N&#8208;oxyanions Using a Redox&#8208;inert Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction chemistry of the bis&#8208;tetrazinyl pyridine ligand (btzp) towards nitrogen oxyanions coordinated to zinc is studied in order to explore the reduction of the NO  x  &#713; substrates with a redox&#8208;active ligand in the absence of redox activity at the metal. Following syntheses and characterization of (btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl, NO  3  and NO  2  , featuring O&#8208;Zn linkage of both nitrogen oxyanions, it is shown that a silylating agent selectively delivers silyl substituents to tetrazine nitrogens, without reductive deoxygenation of NO  x  &#8208;1  . A new synthesis of the highly hydrogenated H  4  btzp, containing two dihydrotetrazine reductants is described as is the synthesis and characterization of (H  4  btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl and NO  3  , both of which show considerable hydrogen bonding potential of the dihydrotetrazine ring NH groups. The (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  complex does not bind zinc in the pincer pocket, but instead H  4  btzp becomes a bridge between neighboring atoms through tetrazine nitrogen atoms, forming a polymeric chain. The reaction of AgNO  2  with (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  is shown to proceed with fast nitrite deoxygenation, yielding water and free NO. Half of the H  4  btzp reducing equivalents form Ag  0  and thus the chloride ligand remains coordinated to the zinc metal center to yield (btzp)ZnCl  2  . To compare with AgNO  2  , experiments of (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  with NaNO  2  result in salt metathesis between chloride and nitrite, highlighting the importance of a redox&#8208;active cation in the reduction of nitrite to NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Upper Critical Solution Temperature&#8208;Type Responsive Cyclodextrins with Characteristic Inclusion Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble and thermoresponsive macrocycles with stable inclusion toward guests are highly valuable to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials for versatile applications. Here, we develop such macrocycles, ureido&#8208;substituted cyclodextrins (CDs) which exhibit unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in aqueous media. These novel CD derivatives showed good solubility in water at elevated temperature, but collapsed from water to form large coacervates upon cooling to low temperature. Their cloud points are dependent greatly on concentrations, and furthermore, can be mediated through oxidation and chelation with silver ion. Significantly, amphiphilicity of these CD derivatives is supportive to the host&#8208;guest binding, which afford them to retain inclusion abilities to guest dyes. The inclusion complexation remained nearly intact during thermally induced phase transitions, which makes contrast to the switchable inclusion behavior of lower critical solution temperature (LCST)&#8208;type CDs. Moreover, ureido&#8208;substituted CDs were exploited to coencapsulate a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched by the UCST phase transition. We therefore believe this novel thermoresponsive CDs may form a new strategy for developing smart macrocycles and allow for exploring smart supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as NanoOctopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, we rationally designed three novel carbazolic derivatives containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1:1 or 1:2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when continuous C  60  &#183;&#183;&#183;C  60  interaction channel existed. Our results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide us new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rate constants for the reactions of dialkyl chalcogenides with laser&#8208;flash photolytically generated benzhydrylium ions have been measured photometrically to integrate them in the comprehensive benzhydrylium&#8208;based nucleophilicity scale. The combination of these rate constants with the previously reported equilibrium constants for the same reactions provided the corresponding Marcus intrinsic barriers and made it possible to quantify the leaving group abilities (nucleofugalities) of dialkyl sulfides and dimethyl selenide. Due to the low intrinsic barriers, dialkyl chalcogenides are fairly strong nucleophiles (comparable to pyridine and  N  &#8208;methylimidazole) as well as good nucleofuges, which makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tetradentate and Tridentate Phosphine Oxide Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new phosphine oxide functionized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for the coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that both 1:1 and 1:2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1 whereas 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol solution. The formation of these species were also validated by fluorescence spectrometry and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of Nd(III) with L1 and L2 were determined using UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1:1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)]&#8231;Et2O in solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both Am(III) and Eu(III) while L2 showed nearly no extraction toward Am(III) and Eu(III) due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of those complexes species formed between Am(III)/Eu(III) and L1/L2 were analyzed using DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu/CuxS Embedded N,S&#8208;doped Porous Carbon In Situ Derived from a Novelly Designed MOF for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reasonable design of the precursor of the carbon&#8208;based nanocatalyst is an important pathway to improve its catalytic performance. In this study, a simple solvothermal method was used to synthesize [Cu(TPT)(2,5&#8208;tdc)]&#183;2H  2  O (  Cu&#8208;MOF  ) containing N and S atoms in one step. Further in&#8208;situ carbonization of the  Cu&#8208;MOF  as the precursor was used to synthesize Cu/Cu  x  S embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC) composites. The catalytic activities of the prepared Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC were investigated through catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP) to 4&#8208;aminophenol (4&#8208;AP). The results show that the designed Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC has exceptional catalytic activity and recycle stability, showing the reaction rate constant is 0.0256 s  &#8208;1  , and the conversion rate still exceeds 90% after 15 cycles. Meanwhile, the efficient catalytic reduction of dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) confirmed its versatility. Finally, the active sites of the Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC catalysts were analyzed and a possible multi&#8208;component synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect has been widely studied in both small molecules and linear polymers. Covalently&#8208;bonded donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with tunable bandgaps and photoelectric properties endow these materials with potential applications in optoelectronics, fluorescent bioimaging, and sensors, etc. However, owing to the lack of charge transfer pathway or effective separation of charge carriers, unfavorable charge recombination gives rise to inevitable energy loss. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments are connected by covalent bonds and can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8208;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8208;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8208;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This minireview highlights the significant progress on D&#8208;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Ternary Indium/Tin/Aluminum Oxide Thin Films, their characterization and Transistor Performance under Illumination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In  2  O  3  , SnO  2  , and Al  2  O  3  were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin&#8208;film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors. After post&#8208;deposition annealing at 400&#176;C the thin&#8208;films are found to be amorphous, however, they show a discrete layer structure of the individual oxides of uniform film thickness and high optical transparency in the visible region. Incorporation of only two monolayers of Al  2  O  3  in the active semiconducting layer the formation of oxygen vacancies can be effectively suppressed, resulting in an improved semiconducting and switching behavior. The heterostacks comprising of In  2  O  3  /SnO  2  /Al  2  O  3  are incorporated into TFT devices, exhibiting a saturation field&#8208;effect mobility (&#181;  sat  ) of 2.0&#160;cm  2  &#183;V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , a threshold&#8208;voltage (V  th  ) of 8.6&#160;V, a high current on/off ratio (I  On  /I  Off  ) of 1.0&#183;10  7  , and a subthreshold swing (SS) of 485&#160;mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  . The stability of the TFT under illumination is also altered to a significant extent. A change in the transfer characteristic towards conductive behavior is evident when illuminated with light of an energy of 3.1&#160;eV (400&#160;nm).</dc:description>

Sensing of metal contaminants in different environments is crucial for the control of pollution. A highly specific sensor for mercury, lead, and copper based on the interaction of pyrene&#8208;based moieties functionalized at their 2&#8208;position has been synthesized and characterized. The detection of fluorescence quenching of the monomer emission allows for a broad dynamic range and sensing is possible in organic solvents and in the presence of other cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Mg2+.

         <title>Dendritic&#8208;Like Molecules Built on a Pillar[5]arene Core as Hole Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;branched three&#8208;dimensional organic molecules are an appealing class of compounds that can be employed as hole&#8208;transporting materials in high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. In this work, two innovative pillar[5]arene&#8208;based HTMs decorated with different triphenylamine fragments are presented. Solar cell performances, stability, and production costs have been deeply investigated with respect to the reference compound spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;branched molecules have recently demonstrated interesting behaviour as charge&#8208;transporting materials within the fields of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). For this reason, extended triarylamine dendrons have been grafted onto a pillar[5]arene core to generate dendrimer&#8208;like compounds, which have been used as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for PSCs. The performances of the solar cells containing these novel compounds have been extensively investigated. Interestingly, a positive dendritic effect has been evidenced as the hole transporting properties are improved when going from the first to the second&#8208;generation compound. The stability of the devices based on the best performing pillar[5]arene material has been also evaluated in a high&#8208;throughput ageing setup for 500&#8197;h at high temperature. When compared to reference devices prepared from spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, the behaviour is similar. An analysis of the economic advantages arising from the use of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based material revealed however that our pillar[5]arene&#8208;based material is cheaper than the reference.

         <dc:description>
New n&#8208;type material? 5,11&#8208;Diazadibenzo[hi,qr]tetracene was synthesized as a new nitrogen&#8208;substituted polycyclic heteroaromatic molecule. This compound showed enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and specific reactivities toward nucleophilic reagents. Reaction with arylamines provided an aminated product that shows an intensely NIR&#8208;absorbing character. Furthermore, a reversible interconversion into the corresponding reduced form was realized.







Abstract
5,11&#8208;Diazadibenzo[hi,qr]tetracene was synthesized as a new nitrogen&#8208;substituted polycyclic heteroaromatic compound by Pd&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of an alkyne precursor followed by oxidative cyclization with bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene. The substitution of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms significantly enhanced its electron&#8208;accepting character and facilitated the direct nucleophilic addition of arylamines under strongly basic conditions to afford the desired amino&#8208;substituted products. The introduction of amino groups induced a remarkable red&#8208;shift in their absorption spectra; the tetrasubstituted product exhibited intense near&#8208;infrared absorbing property. Furthermore, the &#960;&#8208;electronic system, which includes a redox&#8208;active 1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene moiety, underwent reversible interconversion to its corresponding reduced form upon reduction with NaBH4 and aerobic oxidation.

         <title>Single Mn Atom Anchored on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking the indirect route: All the possible reaction pathways for oxygen reduction on single Mn atom anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene including intermediates, H+ adsorption sites, and transition states have been investigated by DFT calculations. Four&#8208;electron O2 hydrogenation pathways were found to be energetically more favorable than direct O2 dissociation pathways, with energy barriers as low as 0.13&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Single Mn atom on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (MnN4&#8208;G) has exhibited good structural stability and high activity for the adsorption and dissociation of an O2 molecule, becoming a promising single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the catalytic activity of MnN4&#8208;G for the ORR and the optimal reaction pathway remain obscure. In this work, density&#8208;functional theory calculations were employed to comprehensively investigate all the possible pathways and intermediate reactions of the ORR on MnN4&#8208;G. The feasible active sites and the most stable adsorption configurations of the intermediates and transition states during the ORR were identified. Screened from all the possibilities, three optimal four&#8208;electron O2 hydrogenation pathways with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.13&#8197;eV were discovered that are energetically more favorable than direct O2 dissociation pathways. Analysis of the free energy diagram further verified the thermodynamical feasibility of the three pathways. Thus, MnN4&#8208;G possesses superior ORR activity. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the design of highly efficient SACs for the ORR.

         <title>A Cytotoxic Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene)carbazolide Gold(III) Complex Targets DNA by Partial Intercalation</title>

Towards new AuIII anticancer agents. Herein a redox&#8208;stabilised DNA&#8208;targeting AuIII bis(carbene) pincer complex with significant cytotoxicity is reported that is likely underpinned by partial DNA intercalation. In silico studies indicate that the complex can also target unusual DNA forms such as 3&#8208;way junctions and Z&#8208;DNA. The structures of several multinuclear AgI complexes discovered en route to the target AuIII complex were also elucidated.







Abstract
The syntheses of bis(triazolium)carbazole precursors and their corresponding coinage metal (Au, Ag) complexes are reported. For alkylated triazolium salts, di&#8208; or tetranuclear complexes with bridging ligands were isolated, while the bis(aryl) analogue afforded a bis(carbene) AuI&#8208;CNC pincer complex suitable for oxidation to the redox&#8208;stable [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ cation. Although the ligand salt and the [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex were both notably cytotoxic toward the breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, the AuIII complex was somewhat more selective. Electrophoresis, viscometry, UV&#8208;vis, CD and LD spectroscopy suggest the cytotoxic [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex behaves as a partial DNA intercalator. In silico screening indicated that the [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex can target DNA three&#8208;way junctions with good specificity, several other regular B&#8208;DNA forms, and Z&#8208;DNA. Multiple hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;type interactions involving T and A bases appear to be important for B&#8208;form DNA binding, while phosphate O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions evidently underpin Z&#8208;DNA binding. The CNC ligand effectively stabilizes the AuIII ion, preventing reduction in the presence of glutathione. Both the redox stability and DNA affinity of the hit compound might be key factors underpinning its cytotoxicity in&#8197;vitro.

Both the redox stability and DNA affinity of the hit compound might be key factors underpinning its cytotoxicity in&#8197;vitro.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Efficient K Ion Storage of M2P2O7/C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) Anode Derived from Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phosphate Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel structured M2P2O7/C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) nanoflake composites are prepared via an organic&#8208;phosphors precursor assisted solvothermal method and a post high temperature annealing process, which could deliver superior potassium storage performance.







Abstract
Metal phosphates have been widely explored in lithium ion batteries and sodium ion batteries owing to high theoretical capacities, mild toxicity and low cost. However, their potassium ion battery applications are less reported due to the limited conductivity and the slow diffusion kinetics. Considering these drawbacks, novel structured M2P2O7/C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) nanoflake composites are prepared through an organic&#8208;phosphors precursor&#8208;assisted solvothermal method and a subsequent high temperature annealing process. The designed Co2P2O7/C composite exhibits the highest rate capacity with 502&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and good cyclability for 900 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 when compared with Ni and Fe based composites. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to their unique nanoparticle&#8208;assembled nanoflake structure, which can afford enough active sites for K+ intercalation. In addition, the robust pyrophosphate crystal structure and the in&#8197;situ formed carbon composition also have positive effects on enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling performance and the electrode's conductivity. Finally, this organic&#8208;phosphors precursor induced simple approach can be applied for easy fabrication of other pyrophosphate/carbon hybrids as advanced electrodes.

         <title>Chiral Chromium Salen@rGO as Multipurpose and Recyclable Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrene&#8208;tagged Cr&#8208;salen complex immobilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions at rGO surface delivers a robust, reusable, heterogeneous catalyst that is efficient in several asymmetric catalytic reactions. Highly enantioenriched compounds were produced and various valuable scalemic compounds were easily isolated in their pure form even when the catalyst was engaged in a multisubstrate procedure.







Abstract
The first immobilization of a pyrene&#8208;tagged chromium salen complex through &#960;&#8208;&#960; noncovalent interactions on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is described. A very robust supported catalytic system is obtained to promote asymmetric catalysis in repeated cycles, without loss of activity or enantioselectivity. This specific behavior was demonstrated in two different catalytic reactions (up to ten reuses) promoted by chromium salen complexes, the cyclohexene oxide ring&#8208;opening reaction and the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition between various aldehydes and Danishefsky's diene. Furthermore, the chiral chromium salen@rGO has been found to be compatible with a multi&#8208;substrate type use, in which the structure of the substrate involved is modified each time the catalyst is reused.

         <title>Self&#8208;Foaming Metal&#8208;Organic Gels Based on Phytic Acid and Their Mechanical, Moldable, and Load&#8208;Bearing Properties.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;organic gels with various morphologies are synthesized successfully from phytic acid (PA), a natural phosphorus resource. Interestingly, PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 forms a self&#8208;foaming gel. The PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 foaming gel shows reversible thermal stimulus responsiveness, and the gel network is unusually weakened at room temperature. The PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 gel has moldable and load&#8208;bearing properties. It presents a novel strategy to develop supramolecular foaming gel materials based on naturally abundant resources.







Abstract
A catalogue of metal&#8208;organic gels are synthesized from phytic acid (PA) and a diversity of metal ions (Fe3+, Cr3+, Al3+, Ce3+, Y3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mg2+) upon heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C. PA&#8722;M gels have various morphologies, including irregular granular (PA&#8722;Fe, PA&#8722;Al, PA&#8722;Ce, PA&#8722;Cr, PA&#8722;Ni, PA&#8722;Co), spongy (PA&#8722;Y), and hollow tremella&#8208;like (PA&#8722;Cu) morphologies. Interestingly for PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 (PA:Fe3+=1&#8201;:&#8201;4) a large amount of gas is generated during the gelation process leading to a self&#8208;foaming gel. The PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 self&#8208;foaming gel shows reversible gel&#8208;sol phase transition. The gel is unusually weakened and transformed into a sol at room temperature, and the sol is reversed to gelation when heated again at 80&#8201;&#176;C. PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 gel also shows shapeable and load&#8208;bearing properties, and it can bear up to 200 times of its weight, depending on the gas amount fixed in the foam gel and the aging time. This work provides a catalogue of self&#8208;foaming supramolecular gels with tunable properties based on naturally abundant resources.

         <title>Deconvolving Contributions to Decoherence in Molecular Electron Spin Qubits: A Dynamic Ligand Field Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling quantum decoherence in paramagnetic transition metal complexes enables the realization of next&#8208;generation quantum technologies from computing to sensing. Phenomena contributing to electron spin decoherence are deconstructed into three groups: the spin&#8208;spin, motional and spin&#8208;phonon regimes. Corresponding molecular design principles are described for each regime, with particular emphasis on the use of dynamic ligand field theory to analyze intramolecular vibrational contributions to decoherence.







Abstract
In the past decade, transition metal complexes have gained momentum as electron spin&#8208;based quantum bit (qubit) candidates due to their synthetic tunability and long achievable coherence times. The decoherence of magnetic quantum states imposes a limit on the use of these qubits for quantum information technologies, such as quantum computing, sensing, and communication. With rapid recent development in the field of molecular quantum information science, a variety of chemical design principles for prolonging coherence in molecular transition metal qubits have been proposed. Here the spin&#8208;spin, motional, and spin&#8208;phonon regimes of decoherence are delineated, outlining design principles for each. It is shown how dynamic ligand field models can provide insights into the intramolecular vibrational contributions in the spin&#8208;phonon decoherence regime. This minireview aims to inform the development of molecular quantum technologies tailored for different environments and conditions.

Novel molybdenum(VI/V) POM&#8208;based self&#8208;constructed frameworks [MoVI12O24(&#956;2&#8208;O)12(trz)6(H2O)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6Hma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;18H2O (1, Htrz=1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole, ma=methylamine), [MoVI7O14(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(trz)5(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7Hma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O (2), Na3[MoV6O6(&#956;2&#8208;O)9(Htrz)3(trz)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7.5H2O (3) and [MoV8O8(&#956;2&#8208;O)12(Htrz)8]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;30H2O (4) have been covalently decorated with tri&#8208;coordinated deprotonated/protonated 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Channels with an inner diameter of 7.5&#8197;&#197; were found in 1, whereas a tunnel composed of stacking molecules with an inner diameter of 4.1&#8197;&#197; along the b&#8208;axis exists in 2; it is occupied by free disordered methylamines, showing selective adsorption of O2 and CO2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. Obvious downfield shifts were observed by 13C NMR spectroscopies for methylamines inside the confined channels in 1 and 2. There are diversified pores in 3 and 4, which are formed by the molecules themselves and intermolecular accumulations. Adsorption tests indicate that 3 and 4 are fine adsorption materials for CH4 and CO2 under low pressure that rely on the environments built by the POMs. Correspondingly, 1 and 2 display reversible photoresponsive thermochromism that is subtlety influenced by the channels. The polyoxometalate organic frameworks (POMOFs) with multiple functional adsorptions are easy to assemble. Their photo&#8208;/thermoresponse properties offer a new pathway for the self&#8208;constructions of one&#8208;off hybrid materials that possess the good properties of both POMs and MOFs.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of NiLDH@YZ Hybrid and Mechanochemical Agitation on Glaser Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present study, NiLDH, YZ and amalgamated NiLDH@YZ catalysts were tested for the Glaser homocoupling reaction. The catalyst 0.5NiLDH@0.5YZ showed superior catalytic efficiency under mechanochemical agitation. This robust catalyst used for four times provides a new strategy in C&#8722;C coupling reactions by using mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of nickel&#8208;layered double hydroxide amalgamated Y&#8208;zeolite (NiLDH@YZ) hybrids and the evaluation of the synergistic effect of various NiLDH@YZ catalysts and mechanochemical agitation on Glaser homocoupling reactions. Nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption experiments were carried out to estimate the surface area and porosity of NiLDH@YZ hybrids. The basicity and acidity of these hybrids were determined by CO2&#8208;TPD and NH3&#8208;TPD experiments respectively and this portrayed good acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature of the catalysts. The NiLDH@YZ&#8208;catalyzed mechanochemical Glaser coupling reaction achieved best yield of 83&#8201;% for the 0.5NiLDH@0.5YZ hybrid after 60&#8197;min of agitation, which revealed the highest acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature compared to all the investigated catalysts. The developed catalyst has proven itself as a robust and effective candidate that can successfully be employed up to four catalytic cycles without significant loss in catalytic activity, under optimized reaction conditions. This work demonstrated a new strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation enabled by the synergy between mechanochemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;F Bond Transformation through Oxymetalation/&#946;&#8208;Fluorine Elimination to Access Fluorinated Isocoumarins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium&#8208;catalyzed system was developed that transforms the C&#8722;F bond of 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluoroethenyl)benzoate derivatives via an oxymetalation process using an indium catalyst to produce various fluorinated isocoumarins. The reactions proceeded under mild conditions without transition metals.







Abstract
Fluorinated heterocycles have attracted much attention in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the synthesis of fluorinated heterocycles. Formidable challenges remain, however, in the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarin derivatives that are among the most alluring structural motifs. Herein, the indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;F bond transformation of 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl) benzoates is reported, which are readily accessible compounds, to give a diverse array of fluorinated isocoumarins. The present reaction proceeds smoothly using inexpensive reagents: a catalytic amount of indium salt in the presence of zinc salt. A theoretical calculation of potential energy profiles showed that the reaction consists of oxymetalation with the elimination of alkyl halide and the &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination.

         <title>Tuning the Nanoaggregates of Sialylated Biohybrid Photosensitizers for Intracellular Activation of the Photodynamic Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An insightful approach towards activatable and nanostructured photosensitizers has been developed by preparing dendritic biohybrids composed of a core phthalocyanine decorated with multiple sialic acid moieties. The resulting hybrids self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined nanoaggregates in aqueous solution, and disaggregate upon reaching the target organelles, resulting in the on&#8208;site activation of a highly efficient photodynamic response.







Abstract
In the endeavor of extending the clinical use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of superficial cancers and other neoplastic diseases, deeper knowledge and control of the subcellular processes that determine the response of photosensitizers (PS) are needed. Recent strategies in this direction involve the use of activatable and nanostructured PS. Here, both capacities have been tuned in two dendritic zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) derivatives, either asymmetrically or symmetrically substituted with 3 and 12 copies of the carbohydrate sialic acid (SA), respectively. Interestingly, the amphiphilic ZnPc&#8208;SA biohybrid (1) self&#8208;assembles into well&#8208;defined nanoaggregates in aqueous solution, facilitating cellular internalization and transport whereas the PS remains inactive. Within the cells, these nanostructured hybrids localize in the lysosomes, as usually happens for anionic and hydrophilic aggregated PS. Yet, in contrast to most of them (e.&#8201;g., compound 2), hybrid 1 recovers the capacity for photoinduced ROS generation within the target organelles due to its amphiphilic character; this allows disruption of aggregation when the compound is inserted into the lysosomal membrane, with the concomitant highly efficient PDT response.

Yet, in contrast to most of them (e.&#8201;g., compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), hybrid &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; recovers the capacity for photoinduced ROS generation within the target organelles due to its amphiphilic character; this allows disruption of aggregation when the compound is inserted into the lysosomal membrane, with the concomitant highly efficient PDT response.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Trends in Conjugated Chalcogenophenes: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are utilized to assess polychalcogenophene properties with different chalcogen substitutions, including polonium, for both neutral and cationic species. Studied properties include bond length, chain twisting, aromaticity and optical properties. Heavier heteroatoms reduce band gaps and cause ring distortion. The inter&#8208;ring bond indicates quinoidal character. Furans are consistent outliers. Doping causes diminishment of bond&#8208;length alternation and further reduction of band gaps.







Abstract
Heavy atom substitution in chalcogenophenes is a versatile strategy for tailoring and ultimately improving conjugated polymer properties. While thiophene monomers are commonly implemented in polymer designs, relatively little is known regarding the molecular properties of the heavier chalcogenophenes. Herein, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine how group 16 heteroatoms, including the radioactive polonium, affect polychalcogenophene properties including bond length, chain twisting, aromaticity, and optical properties. Heavier chalcogenophenes are more quinoidal in character and consequently have reduced band gaps and larger degrees of planarity. We consider both the neutral and radical cationic species. Upon p&#8208;type doping, bond length rearrangement is indicative of a more delocalized electronic structure, which combined with optical calculations is consistent with the polaron&#8208;model of charge storage on conjugated polymer chains. A better understanding of the properties of these materials at their molecular levels will inevitably be useful in material design as the polymer community continues to explore more main group containing polymers to tackle issues in electronic devices.

         <title>Fischer Carbene Complexes: A Glance at Two Decades of Research on Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the reports over the past 20&#8197;years on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions (HOC) involving Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) to obtain diverse carbocycles and heterocycles. The FCCs analyzed contain group VI metals, covering alkenyl, alkynyl and alkyl carbene complexes, which reacted with alkynes, allenes, enolates, fulvenes, heptafulvenes and other polyenic species through concerted or stepway process, some of them co&#8208;catalyzed by other metals. An analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for HOC.







Abstract
The structure of Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) is electron deficient. If bearing an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated system, it can generate a wide variety of compounds by undergoing many different transformations, including higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. The latter are described as pericyclic reactions in which more than six electrons participate. These reactions have been employed in various areas of organic synthesis, resulting in highly selective compounds with a broad range of scaffolds. The first studies on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs frequently yielded competing byproducts. Many groups have attempted to increase selectivity by exploring distinct reaction conditions, reagents and co&#8208;catalysts (e.&#8201;g., metal&#8208;mediated cycloadditions). The present review is the first to focus exclusively on using higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs to synthesize carbocycles and heterocycles. Based on two decades of reports, an analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and the structural diversity obtained by the substituent effect.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Tetrafluoroethylation of Aryl Alkynes with 1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethane Sulfonic Acid Leading to &#945;&#8208;Tetrafluoroethylated Acetophenones</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient radical tetrafluoroethylation was developed that generates &#945;&#8208;tetrafluoroethylated ketones from aryl alkynes and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethane sulfonic acid (TFESA) with AIBN (azobis(isobutyronitrile)). The reaction proceeds chemoselectively at the terminal aryl alkynes under preservation of internal aryl alkyne moieties. A mechanistic exploration using TEMPO, a crossover experiment, and DFT calculations support the notion that this transformation involves radical processes, and proceeds through an intermolecular pathway.







Abstract
The redox&#8208;neutral tetrafluoroethylation of alkynes with 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluroroethanesulfonic acid (TFESA) and azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) proceeds via the formation of vinyl tetrafluoroethanesulfonates followed by a radical tetrafluoroethylation. Experimental and theoretical results support an intermolecular reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Functionalizable Symmetrically and Unsymmetrically Substituted Triarylboranes from Bench&#8208;Stable Boron Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widely applicable one&#8208;pot synthetic approach to air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable triarylboranes with up to three different aromatic rings starting from bench&#8208;stable boron precursors is reported. In addition, these compounds are shown to be easily post&#8208;functionalized, thus making them versatile building blocks for the syntheses of functional materials.







Abstract
A novel and convenient methodology for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sterically congested triarylboranes by using bench&#8208;stable aryltrifluoroborates as the boron source is reported. This procedure gives systematic access to symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted triarylboranes of the types BAr2Ar&#8217; and BArAr'Ar&#8217;&#8217;, respectively. Three unsymmetrically substituted triarylboranes as well as their iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation products are reported. These borylated triarylboranes contain one to three positions that can subsequently be orthogonally functionalized in follow&#8208;up reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings or Sonogashira couplings.

         <title>Cooperative Ligands in Dissolution of Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolution of elemental gold: Gold is dissolved promptly with a combination of two different thiol ligands by ligand&#8208;exchange reaction. Pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol serves as the initiating ligand and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole ligands stabilize the formed AuI cations in the dissolution.







Abstract
Development of new, environmentally benign dissolution methods for metallic gold is driven by needs in the circular economy. Gold is widely used in consumer electronics, but sustainable and selective dissolution methods for Au are scarce. Herein, we describe a quantitative dissolution of gold in organic solution under mild conditions by using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. In the dissolution reaction, two thiol ligands, pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, work in a cooperative manner. The mechanistic investigations suggest that two pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol molecules form a complex with Au0 that can be oxidized, whereas the role of inexpensive 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole is to stabilize the formed AuI species through a ligand exchange process. Under optimized conditions, the reaction proceeds vigorously and gold dissolves quantitatively in two hours. The demonstrated ligand&#8208;exchange mechanism with two thiols allows to drastically reduce the thiol consumption and may lead to even more effective gold dissolution methods in the future.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Selective Formation of D2 Symmetric Octanuclear Organometallic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic effect arising from the different bidentate chelating sites on hydroxamate ligands allows selective coordination modes for the half&#8208;sandwich Ir/Rh metal centers. Despite the potential for obtaining a random statistical mixture of diastereoisomers as a consequence of differences in connectivity, only D2 symmetric octanuclear cages were formed selectively by using asymmetric pyridyl&#8208;carboxylate bridging ligands.

         <title>Design and Application of Mini&#8208;libraries of the miRNA Probes for an Efficient and Versatile miRNA&#8208;mRNA Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNAs constitute a class of endogenous, non&#8208;coding RNAs having a great influence on various processes within the cell. By base&#8208;pairing to partially&#8208;complementary sites located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of target messenger RNAs, microRNAs participate in the post&#8208;transcriptional regulation of the majority of human protein&#8208;coding genes and their dysregulation has been related to many pathological processes and diseases. Thus, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the microRNA mechanisms of action is crucial. Here, we present a new concept of probe design to achieve an efficient and sequence&#8208;independent miRNA&#8208;mRNA cross&#8208;linking. The new strategy is based on the utilization of a controlled mixture of probes for a chosen miRNA, in which the trioxsalen moiety is introduced at the  N  4  &#8208;position of a selected cytidine through short oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers.  In vitro  photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking experiments with mini&#8208;libraries of probes for microRNAs of interest showed variable cross&#8208;linking efficiencies, giving strong evidence for the general applicability of the presented approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl&#8208;induced Polarization Destabilizes Non&#8208;covalent Interactions of N&#8208;methylated Lysines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine methylation can modify non&#8208;covalent interactions by altering lysine's hydrophobicity as well as its electronic structure. While ramifications of the former are documented, the effects of the latter remain largely unknown. Understanding electronic structure is important for determining how biological methylation modulates protein&#8208;protein binding, and how artificial methylation impacts experiments in which methylated lysines are used as spectroscopic probes and protein crystallization facilitators. Benchmarked first principles calculations undertaken here reveal that methyl&#8208;induced polarization weakens electrostatic attraction of amines with protein functional groups &#8208; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;pi interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#160;kT, respectively. Multipole analysis shows that weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. These effects, due to their fundamental nature, are expected to be present in many cases. Survey of methylated lysines in protein structures reveals several cases where methyl&#8208;induced polarization is the primary driver of altered non&#8208;covalent interactions, and in these cases destabilizations are found to be in the 0.6&#8208;4.7 kT range. The clearest case of where methyl&#8208;induced polarization plays a dominant role in regulating biological function is that of the PHD1&#8208;PHD2 domain that recognizes lysine methylated&#8208;states on histones. These results broaden our understanding of how methylation modulates non&#8208;covalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Effect of Fluorine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Site Catalyst in the Ethylene Dimerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene dimerization reaction is one of the most common mechanisms for the production of 1&#8208;butene. Recently metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received extensive attention in this area since they combine all the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in a single compound. Here is reported a computational mechanistic study of MOF&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;site catalyst for ethylene dimerization reaction. Catalytic systems with both biphenyl&#8208;type backbone as organic ligand and its fluorine&#8208;functionalization have been investigated to reveal the origin of ligand effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculations revealed that the nonfluorinated palladium MOF catalyst undergoes dimerization over isomerization reaction. Then the influence of the fluorine&#8208;functionalized organic ligand was compared in the dimerization catalytic cycle, which was strongly favored in terms of activity and selectivity. Catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions were analyzed by energy decomposition analysis revealing the critical role of ligand backbone functionalization on the activity. This theoretical analysis identified three chemically meaningful dominant effects on these catalysts; steric, electrostatic and charge transfer effects. The steric effects promote nonfluorinated MOF catalyst, whereas the electrostatic effects are the dominant factor that promotes its fluorinated counterpart. This theoretical study provides feedback with future experimental studies about the role of fluorine ligand functionalization in palladium MOF catalysts for ethylene dimerization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between the dynamics of nanoconfined water and local chemical environments in calcium silicate hydrate nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium silicate hydrates are members of a large family of minerals with layered structures containing hanging Ca&#8208;OH and Si&#8208;OH groups that interact with confined water molecules. To rationalize the impact of the local chemical environment on the dynamics of water, Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich and Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals were synthesized using the continuous supercritical hydrothermal method and then systematically studied by a combination of spectroscopic techniques. In our comprehensive analysis, the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hanging hydroxyl groups can be univocally assigned to Ca&#8208;OH or Si&#8208;OH environments, and the local chemical environment largely affects the H&#8208;bond network of the solvation water. Interestingly, the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; solvation water found in the Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich environments is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich environment. This refined picture of the dynamics of confined water and hydroxyl groups in calcium silicate hydrates can also be applied to other water&#8208;containing materials, with a significant impact in many fields of materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Architectures Based on Ru&#8208;Nanoparticles/Oxygen&#8208;Rich&#8208;CNT for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we design the uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen&#8208;rich CNT architectures (Ru&#8208;OCNT) via ozonation and hydrothermal approaches. The hierarchical structure of Ru&#8208;OCNT is constructed by self&#8208;assembly of oxygen&#8208;functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles are strongly interacted with OCNT at Ru/OCNT interface for the excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru&#8208;OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru&#8208;OCNT has an overpotential of 34 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  with a Tafel slope of 27.8 mV dec&#8208;1  in 1 M KOH, and an overpotential of 55 mV with Tafel slope of 33 mV dec&#8208;1  in 0.5 M H2SO4  . The smaller Tafel slope of Ru&#8208;OCNT than Ru&#8208;CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates the high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as&#8208;proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report our efforts towards the first total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C from the intermediate of our previous synthesis of (+)&#8208;neoxazolomycin. The synthesis was achieved via a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from amino acid serine in 3.6% and 2.7% overall yield, respectively. The efficiency of our approach is derived from silyl triflate&#8208;mediated reductive oxazolidine ring&#8208;opening and F&#252;rstner&#8217;s Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and protodesilylation reactions. The obtained spectra and optical rotations were in good agreement with those of natural products, thus confirming the structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Size and Geometry of Heteroleptic Coordination Cages by Varying the Ligand Bent Angle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Angling for the right result: Heteroleptic Pd cages containing two types of dipyridyl ligands are described. The common feature of these complexes is the presence of two 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligands (depicted in gray). By varying the ligand bent angle, &#945;, of the second ligand, we were able to able to increase the nuclearity of the assembly from 4 to 8.







Abstract
Spherical assemblies of the type [PdnL2n]2n+ can be obtained from PdII salts and curved N&#8208;donor ligands, L. It is well established that the bent angle, &#945;, of the ligand is a decisive factor in the self&#8208;assembly process, with larger angles leading to complexes with a higher nuclearity, n. Herein, we report heteroleptic coordination cages of the type [PdnLnL&#8242;n]2n+, for which a similar correlation between the ligand bent angle and the nuclearity is observed. Tetranuclear cages were obtained by combining [Pd(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 with 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and ligands featuring a bent angle of &#945;=120&#176;. The use of a dipyridyl ligand with &#945;=149&#176; led to the formation of a hexanuclear complex with a trigonal prismatic geometry; for linear ligands, octanuclear assemblies of the type [Pd8L8L&#8242;8]16+ were obtained. The predictable formation of heteroleptic PdII cages from 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and different dipyridyl ligands is evidence that there are entire classes of heteroleptic cage structures that are privileged from a thermodynamic point of view.

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Responsive Pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;Functionalized NHC Ligand on Ir Complex for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Cp*Ir(III) complex (  1  ) of a newly designed ligand L  1  featuring a proton&#8208;responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N  &#8208;  heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of  1  reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of  1  with HBF  4  in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L  1  H)Cl]BF  4  (  2  ). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protonation of  1  with acid is examined by  1  H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. The proton&#8208;responsive character of  1  is exploited for catalyzing  &#945;  &#8208;alkylation of ketones and  &#946;  &#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen&#8208;borrowing methodology. Compound  1  is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L  2  )Cl]PF  6  (  3  ) lacking a proton&#8208;responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of  1  is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone. Detailed mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations substantiates the role of the proton&#8208;responsive ligand in the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;induced N&#8211;H Bond Splitting of Ammonia and Primary Amine of CuI&#8211;MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  , which is capable of cleaving N&#8211;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as O&#8211;H bond of H  2  O along with the spontaneous H  2  evolution. In the gas&#8208;solid phase reaction of  1  with ammonia and water vapour, Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  was gradually oxidized to NH  2  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF and OH&#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF, respectively, through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations, which was confirmed by XPS, PXRD and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that Cu  I  &#8211;MOF could lower N&#8208;H bond dissociation free energy of ammonia through coordination&#8208;induced bond weakening and promote H  2  evolution by the reduction potential of  1  . To our knowledge, this is the first example of MOFs which activated ammonia and amine in gas&#8208;solid manner.</dc:description>

Direct C&#8722;H activation: Investigation of the oxidation of aliphatic C&#8722;H groups in the presence of nonheme iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family exhibits no uniform correlation between the spin state and reactivity of the oxoiron(V) intermediates and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems, thus witnessing apparent violation of the common &#8220;reactivity&#8208;selectivity&#8221; principle for this reaction.







Abstract
The selectivity patterns of iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family in aliphatic C&#8722;H oxidation with H2O2 have been studied (PDP=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrolidine). Cyclohexane, adamantane, 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyloctane, 3,7&#8208;dimethyloctyl acetate, (&#8722;)&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;p&#8208;menthane, and cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane were used as substrates. The studied catalyst systems generate low&#8208;spin (S=1/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates or high&#8208;spin (S=3/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates, depending on the electron&#8208;donating ability of remote substituents at the pyridine rings. The low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates demonstrate lower stability and higher reactivity toward aliphatic C&#8722;H groups of cyclohexane than their high&#8208;spin congeners, according to the measured self&#8208;decay and second&#8208;order rate constants k1 and k2. Unexpectedly, there appears to be no uniform correlation between the spin state of the oxoiron(V) intermediates, and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems in the oxidation of the considered substrates. This contrasts with the asymmetric epoxidations by the same catalyst systems, in which case the epoxidation enantioselectivity increases when passing from the systems featuring the more reactive low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates to those with their less reactive high&#8208;spin congeners.

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Cured Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Network Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an UV&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ETPTA), linear polymer chains (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and lithium salt solution are designed to satisfy the demands of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability. LiFePO4/Li battery based on the SNP electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycling stability at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has a pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.

         <title>Imide Condensation as a Strategy for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Diversified G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands with Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activity**

The rigid rules of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization: A library of amphiphiles has been synthesized in one step, using a simple imide condensation reaction. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization, anti&#8208;cancer and anti&#8208;parasitic activity of the library has been investigated, uncovering the important factors that govern G&#8208;quadruplex binding and selectivity, yielding a promising new core&#8208;motif and a compound with potent trypanosomacidal activity.







Abstract
A facile imide coupling strategy for the one&#8208;step preparation of G&#8208;quadruplex ligands with varied core chemistries is described. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization of a library of nine compounds was examined using FRET melting experiments, and CD, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and NMR titrations, identifying several compounds that were capable of stabilizing G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with interesting selectivity profiles. The best G4 ligand was identified as compound 3, which was based on a perylene scaffold and exhibited 40&#8208;fold selectivity for a telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex over duplex DNA. Surprisingly, a tetra&#8208;substituted flexible core, compound 11, also exhibited selective stabilization of G4 DNA over duplex DNA. The anticancer and antiparasitic activity of the library was also examined, with the lead compound 3 exhibiting nanomolar inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei with 78&#8208;fold selectivity over MRC5 cells. The cellular localization of this compound was also studied via fluorescence microscopy. We found that uptake was time dependant, with localization outside the nucleus and kinetoplast that could be due to strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of small amounts of DNA.

         <title>Rational Construction of a N, F Co&#8208;doped Mesoporous Cobalt Phosphate with Rich&#8208;Oxygen Vacancies for Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Supercapacitors</title>

Enhanced performance: A N, F co&#8208;doped mesoporous cobalt&#8208;based phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies was obtained by a facile in&#8208;situ pyrolysis. It exhibited highly efficient performance for OER and supercapacitors, which should be attributed to the introduction of N and F allowing regulation of its electronic structure and increasing its electroactive sites.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphates have been widely applied as promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this study, we report a simple method to prepare a N, F co&#8208;doped mesoporous cobalt phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies by in&#8208;situ pyrolysis of a Co&#8208;phosphate precursor with NH4+ cations and F&#8722; anions. Due to this heteroatom doping, it could achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 at lower overpotential of 276&#8197;mV and smaller Tafel slope of 57.11&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 on glassy carbon. Moreover, it could keep 92&#8201;% of initial current density for 35&#8197;h, indicating it has an excellent stability and durability. Furthermore, the optimal material applied in supercapacitor displays specific capacitance of 206.3&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains cycling stability with 80&#8201;% after 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties should be attributed to N, F co&#8208;doping into this Co&#8208;based phosphate, which effectively modulates its electronic structure. In addition, its amorphous structure provides more active sites; moreover, its mesoporous structure should be beneficial to mass transfer and electrolyte diffusion.

         <title>Paramagnetic Solid&#8208;State NMR to Localize the Metal&#8208;Ion Cofactor in an Oligomeric DnaB Helicase</title>

Paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR enables the positioning of the metal&#8208;ion co&#8208;factor in the ATP&#8208;fueled bacterial helicase DnaB from Helicobacter pylori. Diamagnetic Mg2+ is exchanged by paramagnetic Mn2+ and Co2+ leading to paramagnetic relaxation enhancements and pseudo&#8208;contact shifts in the NMR spectra. The Co2+ pseudo&#8208;contact shift surface reveals insights into DNA binding.







Abstract
Paramagnetic metal ions can be inserted into ATP&#8208;fueled motor proteins by exchanging the diamagnetic Mg2+ cofactor with Mn2+ or Co2+. Then, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) or pseudo&#8208;contact shifts (PCSs) can be measured to report on the localization of the metal ion within the protein. We determine the metal position in the oligomeric bacterial DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori complexed with the transition&#8208;state ATP&#8208;analogue ADP:AlF4&#8722; and single&#8208;stranded DNA using solid&#8208;state NMR and a structure&#8208;calculation protocol employing CYANA. We discuss and compare the use of Mn2+ and Co2+ in localizing the ATP cofactor in large oligomeric protein assemblies. 31P PCSs induced in the Co2+&#8208;containing sample are then used to localize the DNA phosphate groups on the Co2+ PCS tensor surface enabling structural insights into DNA binding to the DnaB helicase.

A series of strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#8722; salts. Their catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation depends strongly on the substituents in the BDI ligand. DFT calculations on the mechanism reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles. Hydrogen is activated either by Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine or Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pairs.







Abstract
Strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#8722; salts and were investigated for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. The backbone (R1) and N (R2) substituents on the R1,R2BDI ligand (R1,R2BDI=HC[C(R1)N(R2)]2) influence sterics and Lewis acidity. Ligand bulk increases along the row Me,DIPPBDI&lt;Me,DIPePBDI&#8776;tBu,DIPPBDI&lt;tBu,DIPePBDI; DIPP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Me2&#8208;phenyl, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Et2&#8208;phenyl. The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test showed acceptor numbers of: (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 85.6, (tBu,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 85.9, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 89.7, (Me,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 90.8, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlH+ 95.3. Steric and electronic factors need to be balanced for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. Open, highly Lewis acidic, cations strongly coordinate imine rendering it inactive as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP). The bulkiest cations do not coordinate imine but its combination is also not an active catalyst. The cation (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ shows the best catalytic activity for various imines and is also an active catalyst for the Tishchenko reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylbenzoate. DFT calculations on the mechanism of imine hydrogenation catalysed by cationic Al complexes reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles operating in concert. Hydrogen is activated either by FLP reactivity of an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine couple or, after formation of significant quantities of amine, by reaction with an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine couple. The latter autocatalytic Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine cycle is energetically favoured.

         <title>Polythiolactone&#8208;Decorated Silica Particles: A Versatile Approach for Surface Functionalization, Catalysis and Encapsulation</title>

Polymer&#8208;decorated precursor particles: Silica particles functionalized with polythiolactone polymer brushes are precursor particles for molecular surface functionalization, nanoparticle assemblies for catalysis, and polymer capsules for payload delivery applications.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of colloidal silica has tremendous effects on its properties and applications. Commonly the design of silica particles is based on their de novo synthesis followed by surface functionalization leading to tailormade properties for a specific purpose. Here, the design of robust &#8220;precursor&#8221; polymer&#8208;decorated silica nano&#8208; and microparticles is demonstrated, which allows for easy post&#8208;modification by polymer embedded thiolactone chemistry. To obtain this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material, silica particles (SiO2P) were functionalized via surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA)&#8208;poly(thiolactone acrylamide (PThlAm) co&#8208;polymer brushes. Exploiting the versatility of thiolactone post&#8208;modification, a system was developed that could be used in three exemplary applications: 1) the straightforward molecular post&#8208;functionalization to tune the surface polarity, and therefore the dispersibility in various solvents; 2) the immobilization of metal nanoparticles into the polymer brushes via the in&#8197;situ formation of free thiols that preserved catalytic activity in a model reaction; 3) the formation of redox&#8208;responsive, permeable polymer capsules by crosslinking the thiolactone moieties with cystamine dihydrochloride (CDH) followed by dissolution of the silica core.

The introduction of substituents on a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline was selectively achieved by directed multiple C&#8722;H functionalizations. It could be decorated on four positions, successively at C&#8208;8, C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;5, three of which by using transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.







Abstract
The introduction of substituents on bare heterocyclic scaffolds can selectively be achieved by directed C&#8722;H functionalization. However, such methods have only occasionally been used, in an iterative manner, to decorate various positions of a medicinal scaffold to build chemical libraries. We herein report the multiple, site selective, metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. This medicinally privileged template indeed possesses multiple reactive sites for diversity&#8208;oriented functionalization, of which four were targeted. The C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;8 decorations were directed by an N&#8208;oxide, before taking benefit of an O&#8208;carbamoyl protection at C&#8208;4 to perform a Fries rearrangement and install a carboxamide at C&#8208;3. This also released the carbonyl group of 4&#8208;quinolones, the ultimate directing group to functionalize position 5. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.

The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density as well as the corresponding electronic inner&#8208;crystal forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provide the detailed examination of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A detailed analysis of a complete set of the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density is carried out for noncovalent interactions in the crystal of a uracil derivative using experimental X&#8208;ray charge density. The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.&#8201;g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Partially Saturated Fluorenyl&#8208;Derived [n]Helicenes Featuring an Overcrowded Alkene</title>

Blocking a molecular motor: The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (see figure), cyclic analogs of the well&#8208;known Feringa's molecular motors, are produced via a similar McMurry cyclization approach. While being composed of three diastereoisomers, they serve as valuable intermediates for the efficient, multi&#8208;gram scale access to the aromatic fluoreno[n]helicenes.







Abstract
The straightforward, multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (n=5 or 7) featuring a central, overcrowded alkene is described. The key cyclization step was based on an intramolecular McMurry reaction from the corresponding 1,5&#8208;diketones. Chiral stationary phase HPLC analysis and isomer separation indicate that each helicenic compound is constituted of three diastereoisomers at room temperature, i.&#8201;e. the configurationally stable (R,R,P)/(S,S,M) pair of enantiomers and an apparently achiral compound resulting from the rapid interconversion between the (R,S,P) and (S,R,M) enantiomers. The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes are oxidatively aromatized to give an efficient access to the corresponding fluoreno[n]helicenes. The chiroptical properties (vibrational and electronic circular dichroism) of the chiral, enantiopure compounds have been measured and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, confirming their helicoidal nature.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 28, Page 7696-7703, May 17, 2021. </description>

In the frame: The nitration of the V&#8208;shaped linker 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid by Al(NO3)3 and Ga(NO3)3 prior to crystallization of the MOF leads selectively to Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 and Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 type compounds. In situ IR spectroscopy and light scattering experiments in combination with 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy were used to study the product formation. DFT and GCMC calculations were employed to understand the differences in framework formation and water adsorption properties.







Abstract
The reaction of the V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with CAU&#8208;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type structure of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,&#8201;2,&#8201;4,&#8201;6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), whereas the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8201;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization, as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.

COFs in photocatalytic oxidation of organics: Hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 offers a fascinating alternative photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of valuable small organics such as amines, ethers, thioethers and pyridinium salts. By means of its superior photocatalytic ability in molecular oxygen activation and inherent heterogenous nature, the present protocol exhibits impressive efficiency, selectivity and sustainability.







Abstract
Photoactive two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have become promising heterogenous photocatalysts in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformations. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of various small organic molecules by using 2D&#8208;COFs as the photocatalyst was developed. In this protocol, due to the remarkable photocatalytic capability of hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 on molecular oxygen activation, a wide range of amides, quinolones, heterocyclic compounds, and sulfoxides were obtained with high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance under very mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, benefiting from the inherent advantage of heterogenous photocatalysis, prominent sustainability and easy photocatalyst recyclability, a drug molecule (modafinil) and an oxidized mustard gas simulant (2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide) were selectively and easily obtained in scale&#8208;up reactions. Mechanistic investigations were conducted using radical quenching experiments and in&#8197;situ ESR spectroscopy, all corroborating the proposed role of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 in photocatalytic cycle.

In this study, we functionalized carbapenem &#946;&#8208;lactams for the development of an original activity&#8208;based purification method of the complex targets of these drugs. The alkyne drug covalently bound to the target specifically reacted with an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and an iminosydnone for single&#8208;step elution and fluorescent labeling of the targets.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams, the cornerstone of antibiotherapy, inhibit multiple and partially redundant targets referred to as transpeptidases or penicillin&#8208;binding proteins. These enzymes catalyze the essential cross&#8208;linking step of the polymerization of cell wall peptidoglycan. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of &#946;&#8208;lactams and of resistance to these drugs requires the development of reliable methods to characterize their targets. Here, we describe an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. We synthesized alkyne&#8208;carbapenems with suitable properties with respect to the kinetics of acylation of a model target, the Ldtfm L,D&#8208;transpeptidase, the stability of the resulting acylenzyme, and the reactivity of the alkyne for the cycloaddition of an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and a bioorthogonal cleavable linker. The probe provided access to the fluorescent target in a single click and release step.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Induced Growth of Coordination Polymer Derived&#8208;Straight Carbon Nanotubes on Carbon Nanofiber Network for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The scheme illustrates the sulfur&#8208;induced synthesis of a Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers network with abundant straight carbon nanotubes from a type of Co&#8208;based coordination polymer, which are encapsulated with Co9S8 nanoparticles. Combined with the effective catalytic sites of the Co, N, and S doped carbon nanofibers/carbon nanotubes and the unique structure of 3&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;connected carbon nanofiber network, CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;T shows excellent ORR catalytic activity.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon nanomaterials have been widely studied for efficient oxygen reduction reaction and energy storage and conversion in metal&#8208;air batteries. A Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional network construction of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with abundant straight long Co, N, and S&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed by thermal treatment of Co&#8208;based polymer coated onto polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network together with thiourea at 900&#8201;&#176;C, denoted as CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900. It is interesting to note that the introduction of a high concentration of sulfur does not lead to the complete toxicity of catalysts, but promotes the axial growth to selectively form straight CNTs instead of curly bamboo&#8208;like CNTs. The highly graphitized in&#8208;situ grown Co, N, S&#8208;doped CNTs and the 3&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped CNF network provide both active catalytic sites and highly conductive paths, which are beneficial for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, the optimal CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 performs the excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.84&#8197;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density of 5.49&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air devices also possess a high power density of 136.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 better than commercial Pt/C.

A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 is presented. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized and isolated. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as universal building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.







Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 was developed. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized via stepwise cyclopropanation of C60 with suitable macrocyclic tri&#8208; and bifunctional cyclomalonate tethers. The four resulting stereoisomers were isolated using chiral HPLC. The corresponding pairs of enantiomers show mirror image behavior in their CD&#8208;spectra. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as suitable building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of mixed hexakis&#8208;adducts. Implementation of functional group&#8208;bearing monomalonates afforded octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.

The regioselective synthesis of hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 with more than two different types of addends is still a challenging task in fullerene chemistry. Following a sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalization strategy, chiral [3:2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized and isolated. The isomerically pure pentakis&#8208;adducts served as universal building blocks for the synthesis of a series of octahedral [3:2:1] hexakis&#8208;adducts with outstanding regioselectivity.

The problem of antibiotic resistance requires innovative strategies for the identification of drug targets and the characterization of the emerging mechanisms of resistance. This is the case for the highly diverse and complex targets of &#946;&#8208;lactams that include essential biosynthetic enzymes, the transpeptidases, unessential hydrolases involved in peptidoglycan metabolism, and unknown enzymes. The findings reported here should have important implications in this context, as they propose an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry.

Starting from 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (not shown), in situ nitration leads to different nitrated linker molecules that selectively react with Ga3+ or Al3+ ions to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 and Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 type frameworks, respectively. The pale blue and orange light path represents the crystallization of the respective MOF. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Stock et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100373).

Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non-aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low-coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid-state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Tb&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;, Ho&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;, Er&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Yb&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven gem Hydrogenation: An Orthogonal Entry into &#8220;Second&#8208;Generation&#8221; Ruthenium Carbene Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
On the spot: Light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation elicits the inherent vic&#8208;dicarbene character of a triple bond. This unusual reactivity mode can be harnessed in the form of a novel, safe, convenient and efficient approach to second&#8208;generation &#8220;Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8221;&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes for olefin metathesis that relies on the use of alkynes rather than diazoalkanes as the ultimate carbene sources.







Abstract
The newly discovered light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation of alkynes opens an unconventional yet efficient entry into five&#8208;coordinate Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes with cis&#8208;disposed chloride ligands. Representatives of this class featuring a chelate substructure formed by an iodo&#8208;substituted benzylidene unit react with (substituted) 2&#8208;isopropoxystyrene to give prototypical &#8220;second&#8208;generation&#8221; Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda complexes for olefin metathesis. The new approach to this venerable catalyst family is safe and versatile as it uses a triple bond rather than phenyldiazomethane as the ultimate carbene source and does not require any sacrificial phosphines.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Multivalent Ag&#8208;SR Coordination Polymers with Phosphatase&#8208;Like Activity</title>

A series of self&#8208;assembled multivalent Ag&#8208;SR coordination polymers with high phosphatase&#8208;like activity have been developed. This work represents a new alternative for the future rational design of highly efficient catalysts for hydrolysis of phosphates and carboxylates.







Abstract
We show herein the phosphatase&#8208;like catalytic activity of coordination polymers obtained after adding Ag+&#8208;ions to thiols bearing hydrophobic alkyl chains terminated with a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) group. The subsequent addition of Zn2+ &#8208;ions to the self&#8208;assembled polymers resulted in the formation of multivalent metal coordination polymers capable of catalysing the transphosphorylation of an RNA&#8208;model compound (2&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate, HPNPP) with high reactivity. Analysis of a series of metal ions showed that the highest catalytic activity was obtained when Ag+&#8208;ions were used as the first metal ions to construct the backbone of the coordination polymer through interaction with the &#8208;SH group followed by Zn2+&#8208;ions as the second metal ions complexed by the TACN&#8208;macrocycle. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the catalytic activity could be modulated by changing the length of the hydrophobic alkyl chain.

         <title>Enantioselective CO2 Fixation Via a Heck&#8208;Coupling/Carboxylation Cascade Catalyzed by Nickel</title>

COTWO task. An enantioselective nickel catalyzed tandem Heck coupling/carboxylation synthetic sequence with CO2 is reported that provides ready access to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids and analogous compounds (ee up to 99&#8201;%). Labelling experiments, DFT analysis and X&#8208;ray characterizations enabled both mechanistic steps and stereodiscriminating transition states to be fully elucidated.







Abstract
A novel asymmetric nickel&#8208;based procedure has been developed in which CO2 fixation is achieved as a second step of a truncated Heck coupling. For this, a new chiral ligand has been prepared and shown to achieve enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The overall process efficiently furnishes chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids, an important class of bioactive products, from easy to prepare starting materials. A combined experimental and computational effort revealed the key steps of the catalytic cycle and suggested the unexpected participation of Ni(I) species in the coupling event.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocycles via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Coupling of Thioesters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 28, Page 7651-7656, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins is reported, which provides unique and atom&#8208;economic access to spirocyclic scaffolds. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins has been developed for the efficient synthesis of spirocycles, a privileged scaffold commonly found in natural products. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. Initial mechanistic investigations are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism. The incorporated methylene sulfide substituent can undergo a variety of further reactions to increase molecular diversity and complexity. These results demonstrate that thioester derivatives can be used as powerful building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds.

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is molecular by essence while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid state properties. Solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometallate(POM)&#8211;based Na  9  [Er(W  5  O  18  )  2  ]&#183;35H  2  O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and temperature dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses. Isotopic enrichment with nuclear spin free (  166  Er, I=0) Er  III  ions shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reduction of Ketosteroids to Hydroxysteroids over Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 is a very promising heterogeneous catalyst for the selective reduction of ketosteroids to the corresponding hydroxysteroids through a Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reaction. Interestingly, the process leads to the diasteroselective synthesis of elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxy derivatives in one step, while most chemical and biological transformations produce the 17&#946;&#8208;OH compounds, or they require several additional steps to convert 17&#946;&#8208;OH into 17&#945;&#8208;OH by inverting the configuration of the 17 center. Moreover, MOF&#8208;808 is found to be stable and reusable, and it is also chemoselective (only keto groups are reduced, even in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C bonds) and regioselective (in 3,17&#8208;diketosteroids only the keto group in position 17 is reduced, while the 3&#8208;keto group remains almost intact). Kinetic rate constant and thermodynamic parameters of estrone reduction to estradiol have been obtained by a detailed temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis. The results evidence a major contribution of the entropic term, thus suggesting that the diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities, where the Zr  4+  active sites are located.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H  2  or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N&#8208;doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8212;H&#8943;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.</dc:description>

         <title>Tune the Fluorescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by Controlling the Defect States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of graphite phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) are systematically investigated for the first time. The g&#8208;CN nanosheets (CNNSs) obtained at different condensation temperatures are used as the study models. It can be found that all the CNNSs have two kinds of defect states, one is originated from the edge of CNNSs (labeled as CN&#8208;defect) and the other is attributed to the partially carbonization regions (labeled as C&#8208;defect). Both the two kinds of defect states affect substantially the luminescent properties of CNNSs. Both the FL and ECL signals of CNNSs contain a band gap emission and two defect emissions. For the FL of CNNSs, decreasing the density of defect states can increase efficiently the FL quantum yield, while increasing the density of defect states can make the FL spectra red&#8208;shift. For the ECL of CNNSs, increasing the density of CN&#8208;defect states and decreasing the density of C&#8208;defect states are greatly important to improve the ECL activity. This work provides a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and is of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN. Also, it will greatly promote the applications of CNNSs based on the FL and ECL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Round DNA Aptamer Selection by Combined Use of Capillary Electrophoresis and Next Generation Sequencing: An Aptaomics Approach for Identifying Unique Functional Protein&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In DNA aptamer selection, existing methods do not discriminate aptamer sequences based on their binding affinity and function and the reproducibility of the selection is often poor, even for the selection of well&#8208;known aptamers like those that bind the commonly used model protein thrombin. In the present study, a novel single&#8208;round selection method (SR&#8208;CE selection) was developed by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE) with next generation sequencing. Using SR&#8208;CE selection, a successful semi&#8208;quantitative and semi&#8208;comprehensive aptamer selection for thrombin was demonstrated with high reproducibility for the first time. Selection rules based on dissociation equilibria and kinetics were devised to obtain families of analogous sequences. Selected sequences of the same family were shown to bind thrombin with high affinity. Furthermore, data acquired from SR&#8208;CE selection was mined by creating sub&#8208;libraries that were categorized by the functionality of the aptamers (e.g., pre&#8208;organized aptamers vs. structure&#8208;induced aptamers). Using this approach, a novel fluorescent molecular recognition sensor for thrombin with nanomolar detection limits was discovered. Thus, in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept report, we have demonstrated the potential of a &#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; approach to systematically design functional aptamers as well as to obtain high affinity aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>(Automated) Synthesis of Well&#8208;defined&#160;Staphylococcus Aureus&#160;Wall Teichoic Acid Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important components of the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram&#8208;positive bacterium&#160;  Staphylococcus aureus  . WTAs are composed of repeating ribitol phosphate (RboP) residues that are decorated with&#160; d &#8208;alanine and&#160;  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208; d &#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, in a seemingly random manner. These WTA&#8208;modifications play an important role in shaping the interactions of WTA with the host immune system. Due to the structural heterogeneity of WTAs, it is impossible to isolate pure and well&#8208;defined WTA molecules from bacterial sources. Therefore, we here report synthetic chemistry to assemble a broad library of WTA&#8208;fragments, incorporating all possible glycosylation modifications ( &#945; &#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4;&#160; &#946; &#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4;&#160; &#946; &#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C3) described for&#160;  S. aureus  &#160;WTAs. We have used DNA&#8208;type chemistry, employing ribitol phosphoramidite building blocks, protected with a dimethoxy trityl group, to efficiently generate a library of WTA&#8208;hexamers. Automated solid phase syntheses were used to assemble a WTA&#8208;dodecamer and glycosylated WTA&#8208;hexamer. The synthetic fragments have been fully characterized and diagnostic signals were identified to discriminate the different glycosylation patterns. The different glycosylated WTA&#8208;fragments were used to probe binding of monoclonal antibodies using WTA&#8208;functionalized magnetic beads, revealing the binding specificity of these WTA&#8208;specific antibodies and the importance of the specific location of the GlcNAc modifications on the WTA&#8208;chains.</dc:description>

         <title>What is The Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can it be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arginine methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Some Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent Jumonji&#8208;C (JmjC) N&#949;&#8208;methyl lysine histone demethylases also have N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylase activity. We report combined molecular dynamic (MD) and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) studies on the mechanism of N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation by human KDM4E and compare the results with those reported for N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation by KDM4A. At the KDM4E active site, Glu191, Asn291, and Ser197 form a conserved scaffold that restricts substrate dynamics; substrate binding is also mediated by an out of active site hydrogen&#8208;bond between the substrate Ser1 and Tyr178.&#160;&#160;The calculations imply that in either C&#8208;H or N&#8208;H potential bond cleaving pathways for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation, electron transfer occurs via a &#963;&#8208;channel; the transition state for the N&#8208;H pathway is ~10 kcal/mol higher than for the C&#8208;H pathway due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the N&#8208;H bond. The results of applying external electric fields (EEFs) reveal EEFs with positive field strengths parallel to the Fe=O bond have a significant barrier&#8208;lowering effect on the C&#8208;H pathway, by contrast, such EEFs inhibit the N&#8208;H activation rate. The overall results imply that KDM4 catalyzed N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation and N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation occur via similar C&#8208;H abstraction and rebound mechanisms leading to methyl group hydroxylation, though there are differences in the interactions leading to productive binding of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Gold(I)&#8722;Trifluoromethyl Complexes and their Role in Generating Spectroscopic Evidence for a Gold(I)&#8722;Difluorocarbene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to access [Au(CF3)(NHC)] complexes has been developed, leading to the discovery of a new trimethylsilyl incorporated gold&#8722;NHC trifluoromethyl complex. This, in turn, led to the development of a new and straightforward strategy for the &#8220;one fluoride&#8221; abstraction affording, for the first time, spectroscopic evidence of the corresponding gold(I)&#8722;NHC difluorocarbene analogue.







Abstract
Readily prepared and bench&#8208;stable [Au(CF3)(NHC)] compounds were synthesized by using new methods, starting from [Au(OH)(NHC)], [Au(Cl)(NHC)] or [Au(L)(NHC)]HF2 precursors (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). The mechanism of formation of these species was investigated. Consequently, a new and straightforward strategy for the mild and selective cleavage of a single carbon/fluorine bond from [Au(CF3)(NHC)] complexes was attempted and found to be reversible in the presence of an additional nucleophilic fluoride source. This straightforward technique has led to the unprecedented spectroscopic observation of a gold(I)&#8722;NHC difluorocarbene species.

         <title>A Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Conjugated to a Coumarin Derivative Is a Potent Photodynamic Agent against Prostate Differentiated and Tumorigenic Cancer Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8208;COUPY, is a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. It efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk, differentiated and prostate, hardly treatable cancer stem cells simultaneously and with a similar efficacy. Thus, photo&#8208;induced therapy with IrIII&#8208;COUPY conjugates, such as photodynamic therapy, might provide a new approach for prostate cancer treatment.







Abstract
A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8208;COUPY (3), was recently shown as a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. Therefore, the primary goal of this work was to deepen knowledge on the mechanism of its photoactivated antitumor action so that this information could be used to propose a new class of compounds as drug candidates for curing very hardly treatable human tumors, such as androgen resistant prostatic tumors of metastatic origin. Conventional anticancer chemotherapies exhibit several disadvantages, such as limited efficiency to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are considered the main reason for chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Herein, we show, using DU145 tumor cells, taken as the model of hormone&#8208;refractory and aggressive prostate cancer cells resistant to conventional antineoplastic drugs, that the photoactivated conjugate 3 very efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk (differentiated) and prostate hardly treatable CSCs simultaneously and with a similar efficiency. Notably, the very low toxicity of IrIII&#8208;COUPY conjugate in the prostate DU145 cells in the dark and its pronounced selectivity for tumor cells compared with noncancerous cells could result in low side effects and reduced damage of healthy cells during the photoactivated therapy by this agent. Moreover, the experiments performed with the 3D spheroids formed from DU145 CSCs showed that conjugate 3 can penetrate the inner layers of tumor spheres, which might markedly increase its therapeutic effect. Also interestingly, this conjugate induces apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer DU145 cells associated with calcium signaling flux in these cells and autophagy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a photoactivatable metal&#8208;based compound is an efficient agent capable of killing even hardly treatable CSCs.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carbopentafluorophenylation of Alkynes: The Metallomimetic Pull&#8208;Push Reactivity of Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel three&#8208;component coupling of an allylsilane, an arylacetylene, and a C6F5 group from tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] is enabled by the pull&#8208;push reactivity of B(C6F5)3. Tetrafluoronaphthalenes can be prepared from the resultant C6F5&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes by a photochemical 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. The reaction using a 2&#8208;substituted furan or a silyl enolate instead of an allylsilane also affords a novel three&#8208;component coupling product.







Abstract
We report the novel single&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of an arylacetylene with an allylsilane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] involving C&#8722;C bond formation with C&#8722;H bond scission at the &#946;&#8208;position to the silicon atom of an allylsilane and B&#8594;C migration of a C6F5 group. The 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation occurs smoothly without the requirement for a catalyst or heating. Mechanistic studies suggest that the metallomimetic &#8220;pull&#8208;push&#8221; reactivity of B(C6F5)3 imparts consecutive electrophilic and nucleophilic characteristics to the benzylic carbon of the arylacetylene. Subsequent photochemical 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization affords tetrafluoronaphthalenes, which are important in the pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Owing to the unique reactivity of B(C6F5)3, the 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation using 2&#8208;substituted furan proceeded with ring opening, and the reaction using silyl enolates formed a C&#8722;C bond with C&#8722;O bond scission at the silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbon.

Silylene? NHO Problem! Access to a new lithiated anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) yields a complete acyclic divinyltetrelene series.







Abstract
The synthesis of the new bulky vinyllithium reagent (MeIPr=CH)Li, (MeIPr=[(MeCNDipp)2C]; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported. This vinyllithium precursor was found to act as a general source of the anionic 2&#963;, 2&#960;&#8208;electron donor ligand [MeIPr=CH]&#8722;. Furthermore, a high&#8208;yielding route to the degradation&#8208;resistant SiII precursor MeIPr&#8901;SiBr2 is presented. The efficacy of (MeIPr=CH)Li in synthesis was demonstrated by the generation of a complete inorganic divinyltetrelene series (MeIPrCH)2E: (E=Si to Pb). (MeIPrCH)2Si: represents the first two&#8208;coordinate acyclic silylene not bound by heteroatom donors, with dual electrophilic and nucleophilic character at the SiII center noted. Cyclic voltammetry shows this electron&#8208;rich silylene to be a potent reducing agent, rivalling the reducing power of the 19&#8208;electron complex cobaltocene (Cp2Co).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic design and self&#8208;assembly of complex supramolecular coordination cages with predictable configurations has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in chemistry, which is as mysterious as the starry sky depicted in the cover image. This work reports a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V2E3 cage from two homoleptic cages with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. Moreover, SCC&#8208;2 cage possesses a cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Bai, Y.&#8208;F. Han, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100710).

         <title>Plant&#8208;Derived Stilbenoids as DNA&#8208;Binding Agents: From Monomers to Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stilbenoid (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from trans&#8208;resveratrol dimerization, binds to minor and major grooves of B&#8208;DNA, and to 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA by stacking on the outer quartets accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Consistent with the ability to tightly interact with different DNA secondary structures, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin shows DNA damaging activity.







Abstract
Stilbenoids are natural compounds endowed with several biological activities, including cardioprotection and cancer prevention. Among them, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from trans&#8208;resveratrol dimerization, was investigated in its ability to target DNA duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures by exploiting NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking. (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;Viniferin proved to bind both the minor and major grooves of duplexes, whereas it bound the 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of a G&#8208;quadruplex by stacking on the outer quartets, accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Specifically, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin demonstrated higher affinity for the investigated DNA targets than its monomeric counterpart. Additionally, the methoxylated derivatives of (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin and trans&#8208;resveratrol, i.&#8201;e. (&#177;)&#8208;pterostilbene&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrodimer and trans&#8208;pterostilbene, respectively, were evaluated, revealing similar binding modes, affinities and stoichiometries with the DNA targets as their parent analogues. All tested compounds were cytotoxic at &#956;M concentration on several cancer cell lines, showing DNA damaging activity consistent with their ability to tightly interact with duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures.

Sustainable graphene cellulose paper decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles provides abundant nucleation sites and guarantees uniform Li deposition. And the large specific surface area of cellulose paper lowers local current density and avoids concentration polarization near the surface of electrode. Meanwhile, cellulose paper scaffold with good mechanical strength substantially alleviates the volume expansion of metal Li. Benefited from the synergy between Au nanoparticles and cellulose paper, the electrochemical performance of the Au&#8722;GCP electrode is significantly improved even at high current density.







Abstract
Lithium metal anodes (LMAs) with high energy density have recently captured increasing attention for development of next&#8208;generation batteries. However, practical viability of LMAs is hindered by the uncontrolled Li dendrite growth and infinite dimension change. Even though constructing 3D conductive skeleton has been regarded as a reliable strategy to prepare stable and low volume stress LMAs, engineering the renewable and lithiophilic conductive scaffold is still a challenge. Herein, a robust conductive scaffold derived from renewable cellulose paper, which is coated with reduced graphene oxide and decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles, is engineered for LMAs. The graphene cellulose fibres with high surface area can reduce the local current density, while the well&#8208;dispersed Au nanoparticles can serve as lithiophilic nanoseeds to lower the nucleation overpotential of Li plating. The coupled relationship can guarantee uniform Li nucleation and unique spherical Li growth into 3D carbon matrix. Moreover, the natural cellulose paper possesses outstanding mechanical strength to tolerate the volume stress. In virtue of the modulated deposition behaviour and near&#8208;zero volume change, the hybrid LMAs can achieve reversible Li plating/stripping even at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as evidenced by high Coulombic efficiency (97.2&#8201;% after 60&#8197;cycles) and ultralong lifespan (1000&#8197;cycles) together with ultralow overpotential (25&#8197;mV). Therefore, this strategy sheds light on a scalable approach to multiscale design versatile Li host, promising highly stable Li metal batteries to be feasible and practical.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable copper(I) coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) are self&#8208;assembled in water and they display solvent composition&#8208;responsive behavior that can be followed by emission of the aggregates. The dramatic differences in the emission energy and the morphology of the aggregates have been attributed to changes in the coordination sphere around the copper centers.







Abstract
Luminescent copper(I)&#8208;based compounds have recently attracted much attention since they can reach very high emission quantum yields. Interestingly, Cu(I) clusters can also be emissive, and the extension from small molecules to larger architecture could represent the first step towards novel materials that could be obtained by programming the units to undergo self&#8208;assembly. However, for Cu(I) compounds the formation of supramolecular systems is challenging due to the coordinative diversity of copper centers. This works shows that this diversity can be exploited in the construction of responsive systems. In detail, the changes in the emissive profile of different aggregates formed in water by phosphine&#8208;thioether copper(I) derivatives were followed. Our results demonstrate that the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of Cu(I)&#8208;based coordination polymeric nanoparticles (CPNs) is sensitive to solvent composition. The solvent&#8208;induced changes are related to modifications in the coordination sphere of copper at the molecular level, which alters not only the emission profile but also the morphology of the aggregates. Our findings are expected to inspire the construction of smart supramolecular systems based on dynamic coordinative metal centers.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant molecules self&#8208;assemble into long&#8208;range ordered lamellar structures in bulk with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3 nm), driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics of crystallization for the vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. This crystallization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy may offer an opportunity to create integrated circuits (ICs) with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes by lithographic techniques for the microelectronic industry.

         <title>Unveiling the Hidden &#963;&#8208;Dimerization of a Kinetically Protected Olympicenyl Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto undetected &#963;&#8208;dimerization pathway in an olympicenyl system was revealed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Theoretical calculations gave clear structural and energetic profiles for the &#963;&#8208;dimerization, and regioselective oxidation of the olympicenyl radical afforded biolympicenylidene with significant singlet diradical character and high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization.







Abstract
The &#963;&#8208;dimer of a kinetically protected olympicenyl radical, which evaded the experimental detection, was revealed by conversion into biolympicenylidene with E&#8208;configuration in a regioselective manner. The complicated stereochemistry and energetics of the &#963;&#8208;dimers derived from C2v symmetry and uneven spin distribution of the olympicenyl radical were revealed by the theoretical calculations, and the energetic preference of &#960;&#8208;dimer over &#963;&#8208;dimer by a minute gap was disclosed. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene, a polycyclic ene structure previously considered as reactive intermediate in the phenalenyl radical system, exhibited exceptional stability, which allowed for a detailed investigation on its singlet diradical character and physical properties by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption/emission spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and assisted by theoretical calculations. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene showed high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization reactions, which was attributed to high activation energies for the rate&#8208;determining electrocyclization operated on both disrotatory and conrotatory mode, as well as a small spin density at the bonding sites for the radical&#8208;radical coupling process.

         <title>Supramolecular Alloys from Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular alloy, freely composed of eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination can be created with high crystallinity. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, gaining control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process was achieved by carefully controlling the feed ratio.







Abstract
To create innovative materials, efficient control and engineering of pore sizes and their characteristics, crystallinity and stability is required. Eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage are investigated. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, it was possible to gain control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process, by carefully controlling the feed ratio. This represents the first hybrid material based on fluorinated/hydrogenated porous organic cages (POCs). These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming alloys.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A supramolecular alloy&lt;/b&gt;, freely composed of eight hybrid Tri&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Di&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination can be created with high crystallinity. Although the fluorinated and the non-fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, gaining control over the outcome of the self-assembly process was achieved by carefully controlling the feed ratio.

&lt;p&gt;To create innovative materials, efficient control and engineering of pore sizes and their characteristics, crystallinity and stability is required.

         <title>Bis(Iminophosphorano)&#8208;Substituted Pyridinium Ions and their Corresponding Bispyridinylidene Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized synthetic routes to pyridinium ions featuring two strongly &#960;&#8208;donating R3P=N&#8722; substituents are presented. These substituents cause severe disruption in aromaticity in these cations, and also impart exceptional reducing ability to the related bispyridinylidenes (neutral 2 e&#8208; donors). Preliminary reactivity studies show some enhanced reducing capabilities owing to the low redox potential of the bispyridinylidene.







Abstract
Optimized synthetic procedures for pyridinium ions featuring iminophosphorano (&#8722;N=PR3; R=Ph, Cy) &#960;&#8208;donor substituents in the 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; positions are described. Crystallographic and theoretical studies reveal that the strongly donating substituents severely polarize the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the pyridyl ring at the expense of aromaticity. Moreover, the pyridinium ions are readily deprotonated to generate powerful bispyridinylidene (BPY) organic electron donors. Electrochemical studies show exceptionally low redox potentials for the two&#8208;electron BPY/BPY2+ couples, ranging from &#8722;1.71&#8197;V vs the saturated calomel electrode for 3PhPh (with four Ph3P=N&#8722; groups) to &#8722;1.85&#8197;V for 3CyCy (with four Cy3P=N&#8722; groups). These new compounds represent the most reducing neutral organic electron donors (OEDs) currently known. Some preliminary reductions involving 3CyCy showed enhanced capability owing to its low redox potential, such as the thermally activated reduction of an aryl chloride, but purification challenges were often encountered.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Pentafluorosulfanylative Domino Cyclization of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Alkenes to Oxaheterocycles by Using SF6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let's play dominoes with SF6: The photoredox catalytic activation of SF6 in the presence of a&#8208;substituted styrenes and alkynols initiates a reaction sequence that consecutively forms a C&#8722;O bond, a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;SF5 bond, one after another. Finally, this domino reaction yields pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step. These new compounds bear a complex structure and broaden the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks for chemical synthesis in the future. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Rombach, B. Birenheide, and H.&#8208;A. Wagenknecht. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100767).

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach to Multilayer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality has existed in nature from the early stages of life on Earth. A new form of chirality, multilayer 3D chirality, has been established involving nearly parallel patterns. This work presents the first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality. New complexes of Pd and chiral amide&#8208;phosphine ligands were utilized as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling for assembling various multilayer 3D chiral molecules, which displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of different colors.

         <title>CeCoOx core / Nb2O5@TiO2 Double Shell Nanocage Catalyst Demonstrates High Activity and Water Resistance for Catalytic Combustion of O&#8208;dichlorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have successfully prepared a series of catalysts with different core&#8208;shell structures via hydrothermal method. They were consisted of CeCoOx@TiO2 (single shell), CeCoOx@Nb2O5 (single shell) and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 (double shell) core&#8208;shell nanocages and CeCoOx nanocages, in which CeCoOx was core and TiO2 and Nb2O5 were shell. Then, the influence of core&#8208;shell structure on the catalytic performance of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene was investigated by activity, water&#8208;resistance, thermal stability test and catalyst characterization. The temperature corresponding to 90% conversion of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (T90) of CeCoOx, CeCoOx@TiO2, CeCoOx@Nb2O5 and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts was 415, 383, 362 and 367 &#176;C, respectively. CeCoOx@Nb2O5 exhibited the excellent catalytic activity, mainly owing to the special core&#8208;shell structure, large specific surface area, abundant activity species of Co3+, Ce3+, Nb5+, strong reducibility and more active oxygen vacancies. It can be seen that the Nb2O5 coating can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In addition, due to the protective effect of TiO2 shell on CeCoOx, CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts exhibited the outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability within 1200 minutes. The T90 of CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 was slightly lower than that of CeCoOx@Nb2O5, but it had higher stability and hydrothermal stability. Furthermore, the possible reaction pathway involving the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (MvK) and Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8208;H) models were deduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing the Red&#8208;Ox Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, may have important application in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, we obtained a new charge transfer MOF ( Co&#8208;MOF ) with mixed ligands of H 4 TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating red&#8208;ox active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. Additionally, the charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) units results in a broad absorption in NIR region. Co&#8208;MOF exhibited the efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiating with NIR laser. Under the 808 nm laser (0.5 W cm &#8722;2 ) illumination, the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF promptly increases from room temperature to 151.7 &#176;C in only 10 s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amount of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. Irradiated by 808 nm laser with power of 0.5 W cm &#8722;2 , the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6 wt%) film can reach a plateau at 62 &#176;C from 20 &#176;C within 100 s. Our experimental results from Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrates that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material in promising photothermal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reentrant Photoinduced Morphological Transformation and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Kinetic Products of a Rectangular&#8208;Shaped Amphiphilic Diarylethene Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains and two hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) chains was synthesized, and its photoinduced morphological transformation in water was investigated. Two unexpected phenomena were revealed in the course of the experiments: a reentrant photoinduced macroscopic morphological transformation and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic products of supramolecular assembly. When the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was dispersed in water, its reentrant photoinduced morphological transformation, i.e., photoinduced transition from the hydrated phase to the dehydrated phase and then back to the hydrated phase, was observed by optical microscopy upon irradiation with green light at 20 &#176;C, which was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. The aqueous assembly of the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was controlled by changing the temperature; specifically, rapid cooling to 15 and 5 &#176;C gave J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates, respectively, as the kinetic products. The thermodynamic product at both temperatures was a mixture of mostly H&#8208;aggregate with a small amount of J&#8208;aggregate. This behavior was rationalized by the temperature&#8208;dependent potential energy surface of the supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Ortho&#8208;Directed Dicarboxylation of Cyclopentadiene by Methylcarbonates and CO2 or COS &#8211; First Insight into Co&#8208;ordination Chemistry of New Ambident Ligands</title>

A highly regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated and &#8208;dithiocarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of organic cation methylcarbonate salts Cat[OCO2Me] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, EMMIm+) with cyclopentadiene or by reaction of CO2/COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, PPh4+) was developed. First insight into their coordination chemistry reveals ambident ligand behaviour following Pearsons acid&#8208;base concept. In some reactions with metal Lewis acids, a slow decarboxylation of the [C5H3(CO2)2H] ligand was observed. The mechanism is discussed.







Abstract
This research presents the highly regioselective syntheses of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of a variety of organic cation methylcarbonate salts [Cat]OCO2Me (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with cyclopentadiene (CpH) or by simply reacting organic cation cyclopentadienides Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with CO2. One characteristic feature of these dianionic ligands is the acidic proton delocalized in an intramolecular hydrogen bridge (IHB) between the two carboxyl groups, as studied by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and XRD analyses. The reaction cannot be stopped after the first carboxylation. Therefore, we propose a Kolbe&#8208;Schmitt phenol&#8208;carboxylation related mechanism where the acidic proton of the monocarboxylic acid intermediate plays an ortho&#8208;directing and CO2 activating role for the second kinetically accelerated CO2 addition step exclusively in ortho position. The same and related thiocarboxylates [Cat]2[C5H3(COS)2H] are obtained by reaction of COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+). A preliminary study on [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] reveals, that its soft and hard coordination sites can selectively be addressed by soft Lewis acids (Mo0, Ru2+) and hard Lewis acids (Al3+, La3+).

         <title>Forever Young: Structural Stability of Telomeric Guanine Quadruplexes in the Presence of Oxidative DNA Lesions**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural stability of guanine quadruplexes in the presence of oxidative lesions is revealed using molecular dynamics simulations, CD spectroscopy and immunofluorescence.







Abstract
Human telomeric DNA, in G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) conformation, is characterized by a remarkable structural stability that confers it the capacity to resist to oxidative stress producing one or even clustered 8&#8208;oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesions. We present a combined experimental/computational investigation, by using circular dichroism in aqueous solutions, cellular immunofluorescence assays and molecular dynamics simulations, that identifies the crucial role of the stability of G4s to oxidative lesions, related also to their biological role as inhibitors of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in most cancers associated to oxidative stress.

&lt;p&gt;The structural stability of guanine quadruplexes in the presence of oxidative lesions is revealed using molecular dynamics simulations, CD spectroscopy and immunofluorescence.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human telomeric DNA, in G-quadruplex (G4) conformation, is characterized by a remarkable structural stability that confers it the capacity to resist to oxidative stress producing one or even clustered 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesions. We present a combined experimental/computational investigation, by using circular dichroism in aqueous solutions, cellular immunofluorescence assays and molecular dynamics simulations, that identifies the crucial role of the stability of G4s to oxidative lesions, related also to their biological role as inhibitors of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in most cancers associated to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;

Excitation, delocalization, emission: Molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping. Crystals exhibit prominent dual emission caused by the intramolecular excitation and intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated exciton delocalization along the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing direction.







Abstract
A series of new [2,2]fluorenophanes has been synthesized and characterized; among them, molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping. This, in combination with the synergistic intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, leads to prominent dual emission mediated by charge transfer (CT) exciton delocalization. Support of this new insight is given by mapping the transition density along the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing direction where the intramolecular excitation and intermolecular CT coexist in K2C&#8208;2.

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Esters as Exchangeable Stoppers for the Construction of Photoactive [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2]rotaxane building blocks bearing pentafluorophenyl ester functions have been prepared and stopper exchange reactions carried out to generate a wide range of [2]rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers. Starting from a fullerene&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene derivative, this new strategy gave easy access to a photoactive [2]rotaxane incorporating a C60 moiety and two Bodipy stoppers.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Thin Films of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 by Coordination Modulated Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>

         <dc:description>
Dense, crack&#8208;free, and crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films were grown on silicon dioxide surfaces by coordination modulated liquid phase epitaxy (CM&#8208;LPE). In a stepwise process, the substrate was alternatively immersed in Zr6O4(OH)4(OMc)12 and H2&#8208;bdc&#8208;NH2 ethanol solutions which both contain methacrylic acid as a coordination modulator. For optimal thin film quality, the ideal activation of the SiO2 substrate prior to the thin film growth is key, whereby piranha acid is superior to ozone treatment.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of macroscopically and microscopically homogeneous, crack&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (UiO: Universitetet i Oslo; [Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6]; bdc&#8208;NH22&#8722;: 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate) thin films on silicon oxide surfaces. A DMF&#8208;free, low&#8208;temperature coordination modulated (CM), layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) using the controlled secondary building block approach (CSA). Efficient substrate activation was determined as a key factor to obtain dense and smooth coatings by comparing UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films grown on ozone and piranha acid&#8208;activated substrates. Films of 2.60&#8197;&#956;m thickness with a minimal surface roughness of 2&#8197;nm and a high sorption capacity of 3.53&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 MeOH (at 25&#8201;&#176;C) were typically obtained in an 80&#8208;cycle experiment at mild conditions (70&#8201;&#176;C, ambient pressure).

Quadruply BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes were synthesized through four&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulene exhibits crystal polymorphism, in which the circulene core adopts both planar and saddle conformations in the solid state. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the weaker aromaticity of azaborine compared with benzene renders the flexibility to the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes.

         <title>Racemic Tartrate/Malate Anions Combine with Racemic Complex Cations to Form Optically Active Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;AgI3RhIII2 complex cations with racemic RR/SS&#8208;tartrate gave a single conglomerate containing a pair of enantiomers &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS and &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR on crystallization. While similar treatment using racemic R/S&#8208;malate also gave a single conglomerate, the enantiomers produced have opposite chiralities of &#923;&#923;&#8208;S and &#916;&#916;&#8208;R. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the S form of natural malate, which is opposite to the RR form of natural tartrate. The presence of S&#8208;aspartate led to preferential crystallization of one enantiomer &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS or &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR dependent on the solution pH.







Abstract
Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur's work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, a unique example of this phenomenon is reported, involving ionic crystals generated from racemic RR/SS&#8208; tartrate or R/S&#8208;malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ag3Rh2(2&#8208;aminoethanethiolato)6]3+ (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+) in water. RR&#8208; and SS&#8208;tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916; isomers of [1]3+ to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(RR&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(SS&#8208;tartrate)3, respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution. While spontaneous resolution also occurs when using R/S&#8208;malate, R&#8208; and S&#8208;malate select the opposite isomers of [1]3+ to give ionic crystals of (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;malate)3 and (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;malate)3, respectively. In the presence of S&#8208;aspartate, (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;tartrate)3 are preferentially crystallized from &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+ and RR/SS&#8208;tartrate at solution pH values of 6 and 10, respectively. This finding provides significant insight into the optical resolution of chemical species by spontaneous resolution and the origin of homochirality in nature.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treatment of racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;-Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;complex cations&lt;/b&gt; with racemic &lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt;-tartrate gave a single conglomerate containing a pair of enantiomers &#916;&#916;-&lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt; and &#923;&#923;-&lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt; on crystallization. While similar treatment using racemic &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-malate also gave a single conglomerate, the enantiomers produced have opposite chiralities of &#923;&#923;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; and &#916;&#916;-&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; form of natural malate, which is opposite to the &lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt; form of natural tartrate. The presence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-aspartate led to preferential crystallization of one enantiomer &#916;&#916;-&lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt; or &#923;&#923;-&lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt; dependent on the solution pH.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur's work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, a unique example of this phenomenon is reported, involving ionic crystals generated from racemic &lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt;- tartrate or &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;-[Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2-aminoethanethiolato)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;-[&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) in water. &lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt;-tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916; isomers of [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;-[&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;RR-&lt;/i&gt;tartrate)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (&#916;&#916;-[&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;SS-&lt;/i&gt;tartrate)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution.

         <title>Effect of Manganese Valence on Specific Capacitance in Supercapacitors of Manganese Oxide Microspheres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effect of manganese valence on specific capacitance: Hierarchical manganese oxides microspheres were prepared by hydrothermal and calcination methods. Mn2O3 exhibited Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ transitions during the charge/discharge process. The redox reaction equations of Mn2O3 was proposed based on the electrochemical measurements. Mn2O3 exhibited superior specific capacitance due to the two redox couples and unique structure.







Abstract
Manganese oxides have attracted great interest in electrochemical energy storage due to high theoretical specific capacitance and abundant valence states. The multiple valence states in the redox reactions are beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical properties. Herein, three manganese microspheres were prepared by a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination at different temperatures using carbon spheres as templates. The trivalent manganese of Mn2O3 exhibited multiple redox transitions of Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ during the intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte ions. The possible redox reactions of Mn2O3 were proposed based on the cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammogram results. Mn2O3 microsphere integrated the advantages of multiple redox couples and unique structure, demonstrating a high specific capacitance and long cycling stability. The symmetric Mn2O3//Mn2O3 device yielded a maximum energy density of 29.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Uniform Nanowires Containing a Heterogeneous&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Core of Controlled Length, Composition and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunction nanowires containing a heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology were generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding and &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221;&#8208;seeded growth approaches in spite of distinct molecular size and conformation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units.







Abstract
In this work, it is demonstrated for the first time that heterojunction nanowires, consisting of a gradient and segmented&#8208;like heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core with controllable length, composition and morphology, can be generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding of oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (OPV)&#8208; and oligo(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (OPE)&#8208;containing block copolymers in spite of different chain lengths and molecular conformation for OPE and OPV. More importantly, based on the understanding of the formation of heterogeneous core by the co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding approach, a &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221; seeded growth route was developed, by which linear and branched heterojunction nanowires containing a segmented heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology can be obtained. This work provides a versatile platform to generate heterojunction nanowires with excellent controllability in length, composition, and morphology.

         <title>Hydrophobic POM Electrocatalyst Achieves Low Voltage &#8220;Charge&#8221; in Zn&#8208;Air Battery Coupled with Bisphenol A Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled with hydrophobic polyoxometalates (POM) as cathode material. Compared with common Zn&#8208;air battery, the &#8220;charge&#8221; voltage of this battery decreases very clearly.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;air batteriesare a perspective power source for grid&#8208;storage. But, after they are discharged at1.1 to 1.2&#8197;V, large overpotential is required for their charging (usually 2.5&#8197;V). This is due to a sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Incorporating organic pollutants into the cathode electrolyte is a feasible strategy for lowering the required charging potential. In the discharge process, the related oxygen reduction reaction, hydrophobic electrocatalysts are more popular than hydrophilic ones. Here, a hydrophobic bifunctional polyoxometalate electrocatalyst is synthesized by precise structural design. It shows excellent activities in both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions. In bisphenol A containing electrolyte, to achieve 100&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, its potential is only 1.32&#8197;V, which is 0.34&#8197;V lower than oxygen evolution reaction. In the oxygen reduction reaction, this electrocatalyst follows the four&#8208;electron mechanism. In both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions, it shows excellent stability. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and bisphenol A containing KOH as electrolyte, a Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled. When &#8220;charged&#8221; at 85&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it only requires 1.98&#8197;V. Peak power density of this Zn&#8208;air battery reaches 120.5&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, in the &#8220;charge&#8221; process, bisphenol A is degraded, which achieves energy saving and pollutant removal simultaneously in one Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flower for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)  2  with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)  2  nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)  2  obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25 M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this  ex situ  conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Ir/Cu Catalysis for Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Oxindoles: Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Construction of Quaternary and Tertiary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3,3&#8208;Disubstituted oxindoles bearing quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers are privileged structural motifs, which widely exist in pharmaceutical and natural products. Herein, we describe a highly regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkyl oxindoles through synergistic iridium and copper catalysis, providing a series of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives containing adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in excellent yields, enantiomeric excess, and diastereomeric ratio (for 30 examples, up to 97% yield, &gt;99% ee, and &gt;20:1 dr). This method provides exclusive branched selectivity, excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, and good functional compatibility. Control experiments suggested that the chiral copper catalyst is required for achieving high reactivities and diastereoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Deuteration and Hydrodeuteration: Emerging Techniques to Selectively Transform Alkenes and Alkynes to Deuterated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules has spurred a renewed interest in selective methods for deuterium installation. Catalytic transfer deuteration and transfer hydrodeuteration are emerging as powerful techniques for the selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules. These reactions not only obviate the use of D  2  &#160;gas and pressurized reaction setups but provide new opportunities for selectively installing deuterium into small molecules. Commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are typically employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. In this minireview, we will discuss recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes and alkynes for the selective synthesis of deuterated alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Externally Regulated Specific Molecular Recognition Driven Pathway Selectivity in Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reveals 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene&#8208;diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI&#8208;1 produces ill&#8208;defined aggregate (Agg&#8208;1) due to different H&#8208;bonding motifs of the &#8208;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI&#8208;1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J&#8208;aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg&#8208;2). With 10% DMAP and fast cooling (10K/ min), similar nucleation and open chain H&#8208;bonding with the free monomer in an anti&#8208;parallel arrangement produces identical J&#8208;aggregate (Agg&#8208;2a). With 2.5% DMAP and slow cooling (1K/ min), a distinct nucleation and supramolecular polymerization pathway emerge leading to the thermodynamically controlled Agg&#8208;3 with face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking and 2D&#8208;morphology. Slow cooling with 5&#8208;10% DMAP produces a mixture of Agg&#8208;2a and Agg&#8208;3. Computational modelling studies provide valuable insights into the internal order and the pathway complexity.</dc:description>

In decane, NDI-1 produces ill-defined aggregate (Agg-1) due to different H-bonding motifs of the -COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI-1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J-aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg-2). With 10% DMAP and fast cooling (10K/ min), similar nucleation and open chain H-bonding with the free monomer in an anti-parallel arrangement produces identical J-aggregate (Agg-2a). With 2.5% DMAP and slow cooling (1K/ min), a distinct nucleation and supramolecular polymerization pathway emerge leading to the thermodynamically controlled Agg-3 with face-to-face stacking and 2D-morphology. Slow cooling with 5-10% DMAP produces a mixture of Agg-2a and Agg-3.

         <title>Effect of Topology Structure on Photodynamic Sterilization of Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising photosensitizers due to no self&#8208;aggregation of porphyrin in aqueous solution. However, how the topology of porphyrinic MOFs affects the generation of singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) is unclear. Here, we report the effect of the topology of porphyrinic MOFs on their photodynamic performance. To this end, four porphyrinic zirconium MOFs (MOF&#8208;525, MOF&#8208;545, PCN&#8208;223 and PCN&#8208;224 with different topologies (  ftw  ,  csq  ,  shp  and  she  respectively)) were selected to study the influence of topology on the photodynamic antibacterial performance. The  1  O  2  generation and the photodynamic antibacterial performance followed an decreasing order of MOF&#8208;545&gt;MOF&#8208;525&gt;PCN&#8208;224&gt;PCN&#8208;223. The results reveal that the pore size, the distance between porphyrin and the number of porphyrin per Zr  6  O  8  cluster in MOFs greatly affected the  1  O  2  generation. This work provide a guidance for designing new MOFs for efficient photodynamic sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure polyradical tetrahedral Pd12L6&#160;cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of cages with polyradical framework remains a challenging task. Here we report an enantiomeric pair of quinoid&#8208;bridged polyradical tetrahedral palladium (II) cages that are stabilized by an unusual dianionic diradical (dhbq&#183;&#183;  2&#8208;  ) form. These cages have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, squid magnetometry and mass spectrometry. Single crystal derived X&#8208;ray structural investigations of the iso&#8208;structural cages built on flouranilate linkers confirm the tetrahedral structure of the obtained radical cages. Theoretical calculations showed that the diradical state is more stable than the usual monoradical state of the dhbq anions. A weak ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent radical centres has been observed in the DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic perturbations from the protein affect C&#8208;H bond strengths of the substrate and enable negative catalysis in the TmpA biosynthesis enzyme.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron dioxygenase 2&#8208;(trimethylammonio)&#8208;ethylphosphonate dioxygenase (TmpA) is an enzyme involved in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective hydroxylation at the C  1  &#8208;position of the substrate as part of the biosynthesis of glycine betaine in bacteria and carnitine in humans. To understand how the enzyme avoids breaking the weak C  2  &#8208;H bond in favor of C  1  &#8208;hydroxylation, we set up a cluster model of 242 atoms representing the first and second&#8208;coordination sphere of the metal center and substrate binding pocket and investigated possible reaction mechanisms of substrate activation by an iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species by density functional theory methods. In agreement with experimental product distributions, the calculations predict a favorable C  1  &#8208;hydroxylation pathway. The calculations show that the selectivity is guided through electrostatic perturbations inside the protein from charged residues, external electric fields and electric dipole moments. In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C  1  &#8208;H and C  2  &#8208;H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C  2  &#8208;H bond in the substrate&#8208;bound orientation.</dc:description>

In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C  1  -H and C  2  -H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C  2  -H bond in the substrate-bound orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bis(trifluoromethyl)amido Complexes of Copper and Silver:&#160;Stable and storable N(CF3)2&#160;transfer reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agro&#173;che&#173;micals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)&#173;&#173;amino group is an example for a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing per&#173;fluoro&#173;alkyl, perfluoro&#173;alkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, exampl&#173;es with the N(CF3)2&#160;group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Here, we present a set of CuI&#160;and AgI&#160;bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with un&#173;pre&#173;ce&#173;&#173;dented stability. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleo&#173;philic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)&#173;&#173;amino acetate was obtained that upon hydrolysis gives the fluorinated amino acid&#160;N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido&#8208;Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8208; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide ions are particularly well&#8208;suited for the design of single&#8208;molecule magnets owing to their large unquenched orbital angular momentum and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling that gives rise to high magnetic anisotropy. Such nanoscopic bar magnets can potentially revolutionize high&#8208;density information storage and processing technologies if blocking temperatures can be increased substantially. Exploring non&#8208;classical ligand scaffolds with the aim to boost the barriers to spin&#8208;relaxation are prerequisite. Here, the synthesis, crystallographic and magnetic characterization of a series of each isomorphous mono&#8208; and dinuclear lanthanide (Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) complexes comprising tetraimido sulfate ligands are presented. The dinuclear Dy complex [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2Dy&#173;Cl2}2&#8226;ClLi(thf)2] (1c) shows true signatures of single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior in the absence of a dc field. In addition, the mononuclear Dy and Tb complexes [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2LnCl2(thf)2] (2b,c) show slow magnetic relaxation under applied dc fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards DNA&#8208;encoded Micellar Chemistry: DNA&#8208;micelle Association and Environment&#8208;sensitivity of Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reaction methodologies is a central theme to advance DNA&#8208;encoded screening library technology. Recently, we could show that sulfonic acid functionalized block copolymer micelles facilitated Br&#248;nsted acid promoted reactions such as the Povarov reaction on DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials with minimal DNA degradation. Here, we investigated the impact of polymer composition on micelle shape, and reaction conversion. A dozen sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymers of different molar mass and composition were prepared by RAFT&#8208;polymerization and were tested in the Povarov reaction, removal of the Boc protective group, and the Biginelli reaction. The results showed trends of polymer structure &#8208; micellar catalytic activity relationship. For instance, micelles composed of block copolymers with shorter acrylate ester chains formed smaller particles and tended to provide faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that DNA&#8208;oligomer&#8208;conjugates, although highly water&#8208;soluble, accumulated very effectively in the micellar compartments as an essential prerequisite for carrying out a DNA&#8208;encoded reaction in the presence of polymer micelles.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, we report the synthesis of new  N  &#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds. Solid state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8208;C  alkyne  bond lengths allowed assessing the  trans  &#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the  N  &#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the  O  &#8208;based EBX reagents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two highly efficient metal&#8722;organic framework catalysts TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NHPI and TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NDHPI have been successfully synthesized through solvothermal reactions of which the frameworks are merged with&#160;N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) units for the first time, resulting in the decoration of pore surfaces with highly active nitroxyl catalytic sites. When&#160;t&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) is used as co&#8208;catalyst, the as synthesized MOFs are demonstrated to be highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for a novel three&#8208;phase heterogeneous oxidation of activated C&#8722;H bond of primary, secondary alcohols and benzyl compounds under mild conditions. Based on the high efficiency and selectivity, an environmental benign system with good sustainability, mild condition, simple work&#8208;up procedure has been established for practical oxidation of a wide range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphetes via transition metal free ring closure &#8211; taking the proper turn at a thermodynamic crossing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal free route to phosphetes featuring an exocyclic alkene unit is presented. In this approach phosphanides are added to a variety of diynes generating phosphaallylic intermediates which depending on the reaction conditions transform either to phosphetes or the corresponding phospholes. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combined quantum chemical and experimental means identifies phosphole formation as thermodynamically controlled reaction path, whereas kinetic control furnishes the corresponding phosphetes. Structural and luminescence properties of the rare class of phosphetes are explored, as well as for selected key intermediates.</dc:description>

The reaction of 1a/1b with [CpRNiBr]2 (CpR = CpBn (1,2,3,4,5&#8208;penta&#8208;benzyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl), Cp''' (1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)) was studied, to yield novel complexes depending on steric effects and stoichiometric ratios. Besides the transfer of the complete En&#160;unit, a degradation as well as aggregation can be observed. Thus, the prismane derivatives [(Cp'''Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3:3&#8208;E4)] (2a (E = P); 2b (E = As)) or the arsenic containing cubane [{(Cp'''Ni)3(&#956;3&#8209;As)(As4)] (5) are formed. Furthermore, the bromine bridged cubanes of the type [(CpRNi)3{Ni(&#956;&#8209;Br)}(&#956;3&#8208;E)4]2 (CpR = Cp''': 6a (E = P), 6b (E = As), CpR&#160;=&#160;CpBn: 8a (E = P), 8b (E&#160;=&#160;As)) can be isolated. Here, a stepwise transfer of En units is possible, with a cyclo&#8208;E42&#8208; ligand being introduced and unprecedented triple&#8208;decker compounds of the type [{(CpRNi)3Ni(&#956;3&#8209;E)4}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8209;E'4)] (CpR = CpBn, Cp'''; E/E' = P, As) are obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Study of ground state interactions of enantiopure chiral quaternary ammonium salts and amides, nitroalkanes, nitroalkenes, esters, heterocycles, ketones and fluoroamides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis provides high level of enantiocontrol, however no experimental data showed the interaction of catalysts and substrates. We have carried out 1H&#8208;NMR titration of Cinchona and Maruoka ammonium bromides vs nitro, carbonyl, heterocycles, and N&#8208;F containing compounds. We found that neutral organic species and quaternary ammonium salts interacted via an ensemble of catalyst +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H, specific for each substrate studied. The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls via a diverse set of +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, via specific C&#8208;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Trapping of Multiple Transient Azolyllithiums in Batch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments in flow microreactor technology have allowed the use of transient organolithium compounds that cannot be realized in a batch reactor. However, trapping of the transient heteroaryllithiums in &#8220;halogen dance&#8221; is still challenging. We report trapping of such short&#8208;lived azolyllithiums in a batch reactor by developing a finely tuned in situ zincation using zinc halide diamine complexes, whose reaction rate is controlled by the appropriate choice of the diamine ligand. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0 &#176;C with high reproducibility on a multi&#8208;gram scale. This method was applicable to a wide range of brominated azoles allowing for deprotonative functionalization, which was used for the concise divergent syntheses of both constitutional isomers of biologically active azoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Amphiphilic Porphyrins to Construct Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic photosensitizers greatly affect the cell permeability and enrichment in tumours. They cannot be used directly for clinical applications because they always reunite in water, preventing their circulation in the blood and accumulation in tumour cells. As a result, amphiphilic photosensitizers are highly desirable. Although nanomaterial&#8208;based photosensitizers can solve water solubility, they have disadvantages of complicated operation, poor reproducibility, low drug loading, and poor stability. In this work, we propose an efficient synthesis strategy that converts small molecules into nanoparticles in 100% aqueous solution via the molecular assemble without addition of any foreign species. Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and different lengths of ethylene glycol chains are synthesized as TPP&#8208;PPh  3  , TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;2PEG and TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;4PEG to improve amphiphilicity. Among of three photosensitizers, TPP&#8208;PPh3&#8208;4PEG is the most efficient (singlet oxygen yield: 0.89) for tumour photodynamic therapy not only because of its definite constituent, but also because its amphiphilic structure allows it to self&#8208;assemble in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and molecular docking study of the interaction between neutral Re(I) tetrazolate complexes and bovine serum albumin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Re(I) complexes have potential in biomedical sciences as imaging agents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Re(I) complexes interact with carrier proteins, like serum albumins. Here, we used two neutral Re(I) complexes (  fac  &#8208;[Re(CO)  3  (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)L], where L is either 4&#8208;cyanophenyltetrazolate  (1)  or 4&#8208;methoxycarbonylphenyltetrazole ester  (2)  , to study the interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spectroscopic measurements, calculations of thermodynamic and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer parameters, as well as molecular modelling were performed to study differential binding between BSA and complex  1  and  2  . Induced&#8208;fit docking combined with quantum&#8208;polarised ligand docking were employed in what is believed to be a first for a Re(I) complex as a ligand for BSA. Our findings provide a basis for other molecular interaction studies and suggest that subtle functional group alterations at the terminal region of the Re(I) complex have a significant impact on the ability of this class of compounds to interact with BSA; which is important for the functional design of Re(I) complexes in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Vapochromic Luminescence Accompanied by Planar&#8211;Half&#8208;Chair Conformational Change of a Propeller&#8208;Shaped Boron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leakage of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is one of the most severe industrial accidents because it can cause environmental pollution, global warming, fire, and explosion. Hence the visualization of leakage is an essential technology to detect it at an early stage. Molecular crystals whose fluorescence color can be changed by the exposure to VOCs could potentially serve as the sensing materials for realizing rapid and facile VOC detection. These materials, however, usually require harsh conditions, such as heating or a vacuum, to recover their initial phases for reuse. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain completely reversible sensing systems without such energy&#8208;consuming recycling processes. Here we report the reversible color change of fluorescence from the crystals of a propeller&#8208;shaped boron  &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex. The complex was crystallized in distinct crystalline phases having different luminescent colors. Importantly, these phases were interconverted repeatedly upon exposure to the vapors of the appropriate VOCs. The small energy differences between conformers of the complex could lead to this pseudopolymorphic behavior. This finding could be applied for the development of further eco&#8208;friendly reversible sensing materials based on four&#8208;coordinated boron complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Highly Functional All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters from Vinyl Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of highly functional quaternary carbon centers is reported using decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8210;C(sp3) bond formation reactions. The key substrate, a vinyl cyclic carbonate, is activated to provide concomitantly both the requisite nucleophile (by formal umpolung) and electrophile reaction partner preceding the asymmetric crosscoupling process. A wide screening of reaction conditions, additives and catalyst precursors afforded a protocol that enabled access to a series of compounds featuring densely functionalized, elusive quaternary carbon stereocenters in appreciable yield and with enantiomeric ratios (er&#180;s) of up to 90:10.</dc:description>
