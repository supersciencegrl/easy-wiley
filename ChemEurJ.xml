         <title>One&#8208;Step Template/Solvent&#8208;Free Pyrolysis for   in&#8208;situ  &#160;Immobilization of CoP Nanoparticles onto N and P  co&#8208;Doped Carbon Porous Nanosheets towards&#160;High&#8208;efficiency Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for economical, active and stable electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly imperative for the progression of water electrolysis technology and related sustainable energy conversion technologies. The delicate&#160;optimization of chemical composition and architectural configuration is paramount to design high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis approach for in&#8208;situ&#160;immobilizing uniform CoP nanoparticles onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets (denoted as CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs hereafter). The simultaneous consideration of architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization renders the formed CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs with plentiful well&#8208;dispersed anchored active sites, shortened pathway for mass diffusion, enhanced electric conductivity, and reinforced mechanical stability. As a consequence, the optimized CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs exhibit an overpotential of 115 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, small Tafel slope of 74.2 mV dec&#8208;1, high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%, and superb long&#8208;term durability in an alkaline medium. Given the fabrication feasibility, mass production potential and outstanding HER performance, the CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs may hold great promise for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. More importantly, the explored one&#8208;step template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis methodology offers a feasible and versatile route to fabricate carbon nanosheet&#8208;based nanocomposites for diverse energy conversation&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic metal&#8208;organic frameworks and derived composites for microelectronics applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extraordinary characteristic features of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) make them applicable for use in a variety of fields but their conductivity in microelectronics over a wide relative humidity (RH) range has not been extensively explored. To achieve good performance, MOFs must be stable in water, i.e., under humid conditions. However, the design of ultrastable hydrophobic MOFs with high conductivity for use in microelectronics as conducting and dielectric materials remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss applications of an emerging class of hydrophobic MOFs with respect to their use as active sensor coatings, tunable low&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and conductivity, which provide high&#8208;level roadmap for stimulating the next steps toward the development and implementation of hydrophobic MOFs for use in microelectronic devices. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chain and fluorinated linkers, doping of redox&#8208;active TCNQ, the use of guest molecules, and conducting polymers or carbon materials in the pores or surface of MOFs have been utilized to produce hydrophobic MOFs. The contact angle of a water droplet and a coating can be used to evaluate the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of a MOF. These unique advantages enable hydrophobic MOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Classic representative examples of each category are discussed in terms of coordination structures, types of hydrophobic design, and potential microelectronic applications. Lastly, a summary and outlook as concluding remarks in this field are presented. We envision that future research in the area of hydrophobic MOFs promise to provide important breakthroughs in microelectronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad Scope and High&#8208;yield Access to Unsymmetrical Acyclic [11C]ureas for Biomedical Imaging from [11C]carbonyl Difluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective methods are needed for labelling acyclic ureas with carbon&#8208;11 (  t  1/2  = 20.4 min) as potential radiotracers for biomedical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we describe the rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymetrical acyclic [  11  C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7 minutes) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [  11  C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines. This methodology is compatible with diverse functionality (e.g., hydroxy, carboxyl, amino, amido, or pyridyl) in the substrate amines. The labelling process proceeds through putative [  11  C]carbamoyl fluorides and for primary amines through identifiable [  11  C]isocyanate intermediates. Unsymmetrical [  11  C]ureas are produced with negligible amounts of unwanted symmetrical [  11  C]urea byproducts. Moreover, the overall labelling method tolerates trace water and the generally moderate to excellent yields show good reproducibility. [  11  C]Carbonyl difluoride shows exceptional promise for application to the synthesis of acyclic [  11  C]ureas as new radiotracers for biomedical imaging with PET.</dc:description>

         <title>Plant&#8208;derived stilbenoids as DNA&#8208;binding agents: from monomers to dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stilbenoids are natural compounds endowed with several biological activities, including cardioprotection and cancer prevention. Among them, (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from  trans  &#8208;resveratrol dimerization, was here investigated in its ability to target DNA duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures by exploiting NMR, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking. (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;Viniferin proved to bind both the minor and major grooves of duplexes, whereas it bound the 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of a G&#8208;quadruplex by stacking on the outer quartets, accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Noteworthy, (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin demonstrated higher affinity for the investigated DNA targets than its monomeric counterpart. Additionally, the methoxylated derivatives of (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin and  trans  &#8208;resveratrol, i.e. (&#177;)&#8208;pterostilbene&#8208;  trans  &#8208;dihydrodimer and  trans  &#8208;pterostilbene respectively, were evaluated, revealing similar binding modes, affinities and stoichiometries with the DNA targets as their parent analogues. All the tested compounds were cytotoxic at &#181;M concentration on several cancer cell lines, showing DNA damaging activity consistent with their ability to tightly interact with duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous calcium phosphates: Solvent&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization through the Epoxide Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials where their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use in key biomedical applications as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is   crucial in bone development mechanisms. However, the obtainment of this highly desired (bio)material with control over its shape, size and phase purity remains as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of   pure and stable ACP colloids   . By using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine we are able to avoid t   he natural tendency of ACP to maturate into more stable and crystalline apatites. Moreover, this procedure offers size control, ranging from small nanoparticles (60 nm) to micrometric spheroids (500 nm), and the eventual fractalization of the microstructure, by simply adjusting the   composition of the solvent mixture, means   ethylene glycol:glycerine   ratio.   These findings introduce the use of green   solvents as a new tool to control crystallinity and/or particle size in the synthesis of nanomaterials, avoiding the use of capping agents and preserving the natural chemical reactivity of the pristine surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Reevaluating the Solution Photophysics of Tetraphenylethylene at the Origin of their Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through actinometric NMR evaluation of the photoisomerization kinetics of tetraphenylethylene simple derivatives, it is shown that process is the almost exclusive nonradiative pathway accounting for their luminescence quenching in solution, while photocyclization plays at best a minor role.







Abstract
Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the construction of molecules with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm, which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, the first experimental evaluation of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes is reported, and photoisomerization is shown to be by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule&#8216;s excited state in degassed solution.

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Cured Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Network Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an UV&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ETPTA), linear polymer chains (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and lithium salt solution are designed to satisfy the demands of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability. LiFePO4/Li battery based on the SNP electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycling stability at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has a pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocycles via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Coupling of Thioesters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins is reported, which provides unique and atom&#8208;economic access to spirocyclic scaffolds. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins has been developed for the efficient synthesis of spirocycles, a privileged scaffold commonly found in natural products. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. Initial mechanistic investigations are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism. The incorporated methylene sulfide substituent can undergo a variety of further reactions to increase molecular diversity and complexity. These results demonstrate that thioester derivatives can be used as powerful building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds.

         <title>Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel photoswitches based on a cyclopentadienone derivative dimer was synthesized. Their photoswitching properties were investigated.







Abstract
A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3&#8208;pyridinyl, 4&#8208;nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.

         <dc:description>
Compared to common types of Au(I) coordination, such as linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral units observed in extended solids, the square planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia, shown in the cover image, exhibits the 3&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8208;Tt&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn&#8208;Au (on her feathers), square planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her pendant), and linear &#8230;&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;&#8230; chains (her legs) that are characteristic of the novel equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.

         <title>Cationic Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate: Deciphering Elementary Reactions, Isolation of Intermediates, and Computational Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperativity between cationic zinc hydrides and triphenylborane is utilized to catalyze CO2 reduction. Elementary reactions provide insights into a general mechanism for zinc hydride promoted CO2 hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The significance of the zinc&#8208;bound ligand denticity and the Lewis acid additive role in the catalytic process is highlighted. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Maron, A. Venugopal, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005392).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cooperativity between cationic zinc hydrides and triphenylborane&lt;/b&gt; is utilized to catalyze CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Elementary reactions provide insights into a general mechanism for zinc hydride promoted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The significance of the zinc&#8208;bound ligand denticity and the Lewis acid additive role in the catalytic process is highlighted. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Maron, A. Venugopal, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202005392"&gt;10.1002/chem.202005392&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Interconnectivity between Surface Reactivity and Self&#8208;Assembly of Kemp Elimination Catalyzing Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered assembly: Synthetic functional assembly of catalytic unit (gold nanorod), principally regulated through their surface catalytic reactivity towards proton transfer reaction is reported. The hydrophobic cavities formed during flocking of gold nanorods has been utilized as reactors for hydrophobic substrates towards aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction in aqueous media, demonstrating a catalytic cascading which is completely unrelated to primary reaction products.







Abstract
Understanding the fundamental facts behind dynamicity of catalytic processes has been a longstanding quest across disciplines. Herein, we report self&#8208;assembly of catalytically active gold nanorods that can be regulated by tuning its reactivity towards a proton transfer reaction at different pH. Unlike substrate&#8208;induced templating and co&#8208;operativity, the enhanced aggregation rate is due to alteration of catalytic surface charge only during reactivity as negatively charged transition state of reactant (5&#8208;nitrobenzisoxazole) is formed on positively charged nanorod while undergoing a concerted E2&#8208;pathway. Herein, enhanced diffusivity during catalytic processes might also act as an additional contributing factor. Furthermore, we have also shown that nanosized hydrophobic cavities of clustered nanorods can also efficiently accelerate the rate of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, which also demonstrates a catalytic phenomenon that can lead to cascading of other reactions where substrates and products of the starting reactions are not directly involved.

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Microflow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid (0.5 to 10&#8197;s), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful lactamization was achieved using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. This work reports two methods using NMM and NMI, respectively. The slight difference in basicity is critical in the lactamization depending on the type of lactam. A plausible reaction mechanism was discussed. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without tedious purifications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Fuse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100059).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (not shown), in situ nitration leads to different nitrated linker molecules that selectively react with Ga3+ or Al3+ ions to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 and Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 type frameworks, respectively. The pale blue and orange light path represents the crystallization of the respective MOF. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Stock et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100373).

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization, Coordination Behavior and Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of parent pentaphosphaferrocene [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] has been achieved after more than 30 years, closing the gap within the large class of pentaphosphaferrocenes; the cover image depicts the parent compound taking its proper place on the family tree. The influence of the unsubstituted Cp ligand on the complex formation was shown, reflecting specific conditions during the synthesis, its eclipsed conformation, different coordination behavior towards CuI halides and ability to template the construction of nano&#8208;sized fullerene&#8208;like spheres, acting hereby, in contrast to the other homologous, as an electron donor.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Induced Growth of Coordination Polymer Derived&#8208;Straight Carbon Nanotubes on Carbon Nanofiber Network for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scheme illustrates the sulfur&#8208;induced synthesis of a Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers network with abundant straight carbon nanotubes from a type of Co&#8208;based coordination polymer, which are encapsulated with Co9S8 nanoparticles. Combined with the effective catalytic sites of the Co, N, and S doped carbon nanofibers/carbon nanotubes and the unique structure of 3&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;connected carbon nanofiber network, CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;T shows excellent ORR catalytic activity.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon nanomaterials have been widely studied for efficient oxygen reduction reaction and energy storage and conversion in metal&#8208;air batteries. A Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional network construction of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with abundant straight long Co, N, and S&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed by thermal treatment of Co&#8208;based polymer coated onto polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network together with thiourea at 900&#8201;&#176;C, denoted as CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900. It is interesting to note that the introduction of a high concentration of sulfur does not lead to the complete toxicity of catalysts, but promotes the axial growth to selectively form straight CNTs instead of curly bamboo&#8208;like CNTs. The highly graphitized in&#8208;situ grown Co, N, S&#8208;doped CNTs and the 3&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped CNF network provide both active catalytic sites and highly conductive paths, which are beneficial for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, the optimal CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 performs the excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.84&#8197;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density of 5.49&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air devices also possess a high power density of 136.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 better than commercial Pt/C.

Furthermore, the CNFT&#8208;Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;900&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air devices also possess a high power density of 136.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; better than commercial Pt/C.&lt;/p&gt;

B12&#8208;derived phenyl&#8208;corrins are antivitamins B12 that resist the enzymatic cleavage of their Co&#8722;C bond. Surprisingly, as shown by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID, the Co&#8722;Csp2 bonds of phenyl&#8208;corrins are weaker than Co&#8722;Csp3 bonds of analogous methyl&#8208;corrins, contrasting the known effect of the hybridization on bond strengths. Hence, for the behavior of phenyl&#8208;cobalamins as antivitamins B12, stereo&#8208;electronic restrictions of the nucleophilic displacement are more critical than Co&#8722;C bond strengths.

         <title>Glycerol as a Substrate and Inactivator of Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct enzymes, coenzyme B12&#8208;dependent diol dehydratase (B12&#8208;dDDH) and coenzyme B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), are capable of catalyzing the selective transformation of glycerol to 3&#8208;hydroxypropionaldehyde. Only the former enzyme is subject to substrate&#8208;induced inactivation, however. Utilizing molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanical (QM), and hybrid QM/MM techniques, we found that inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH occurs if hydrogen abstraction takes place from the &#8216;wrong&#8217; side (C3) of glycerol.







Abstract
Diol dehydratase, dependent on coenzyme B12 (B12&#8208;dDDH), displays a peculiar feature of being inactivated by its native substrate glycerol (GOL). Surprisingly, the isofunctional enzyme, B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), does not undergo suicide inactivation by GOL. Herein we present a series of QM/MM and MD calculations aimed at understanding the mechanisms of substrate&#8208;induced suicide inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH and that of resistance of B12&#8208;iGDH to inactivation. We show that the first step in the enzymatic transformation of GOL, hydrogen abstraction, can occur from both ends of the substrate (either C1 or C3 of GOL). Whereas C1 abstraction in both enzymes leads to product formation, C3 abstraction in B12&#8208;dDDH results in the formation of a low energy radical intermediate, which is effectively trapped within a deep well on the potential energy surface. The long lifetime of this radical intermediate likely enables its side reactions, leading to inactivation. In B12&#8208;iGDH, by comparison, C3 abstraction is an endothermic step; consequently, the resultant radical intermediate is not of low energy, and the reverse process of reforming the reactant is possible.

         <title>Enantioselective CO2 Fixation Via a Heck&#8208;Coupling/Carboxylation Cascade Catalyzed by Nickel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COTWO task. An enantioselective nickel catalyzed tandem Heck coupling/carboxylation synthetic sequence with CO2 is reported that provides ready access to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids and analogous compounds (ee up to 99&#8201;%). Labelling experiments, DFT analysis and X&#8208;ray characterizations enabled both mechanistic steps and stereodiscriminating transition states to be fully elucidated.







Abstract
A novel asymmetric nickel&#8208;based procedure has been developed in which CO2 fixation is achieved as a second step of a truncated Heck coupling. For this, a new chiral ligand has been prepared and shown to achieve enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The overall process efficiently furnishes chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids, an important class of bioactive products, from easy to prepare starting materials. A combined experimental and computational effort revealed the key steps of the catalytic cycle and suggested the unexpected participation of Ni(I) species in the coupling event.

         <title>Intersystem Crossing and Electron Spin Selectivity in Anthracene&#8208;Naphthalimide Compact Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Showing Different Geometry and Electronic Coupling Magnitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dependency of the charge transfer and Intersystem crossing on molecular geometry and electronic coupling in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads: Efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) was observed in compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads. The electron spin selectivity of the ISC was studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra.







Abstract
Anthracene&#8208;naphthalimide (An&#8208;NI) compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads were prepared, in which the orientation and distance between the two subunits were varied by direct connection or with intervening phenyl linker. Efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and long triplet state lifetime (&#934;&#916;=92&#8201;%, &#964;T=438&#8197;&#956;s) were observed for the directly connected dyads showing a perpendicular geometry (81&#176;). This efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) takes 376&#8197;fs, inhibits the direct charge recombination (CR) to ground state (1CT&#8594;S0, takes 3.04&#8197;ns). Interestingly, efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC for dyads with intervening phenyl linker (&#934;&#916;=40&#8201;% in DCM) was also observed, although the electron donor and acceptor adopt almost coplanar geometry (dihedral angle: 15&#176;). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy shows that the electron spin polarization of the triplet state, i.&#8201;e. the electron spin selectivity of ISC, is highly dependent on the dihedral angle and the linker. For the dyads showing weaker coupling between the donor and acceptors, the charge separation and the intramolecular triplet energy transfer are inhibited at 80&#8197;K (frozen solution), because both the 3An and 3NI states were observed and the ESP are same as compared to the native anthracene and naphthalimide, which unravel their origin. The dyads were used as triplet photosensitizers for triplet&#8722;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA UC). High UC quantum yield (&#934;UC=12.9&#8201;%) as well as a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (0.72&#8197;eV) was attained by excitation into the CT absorption band.

         <title>Photochemical Activation of Aromatic Aldehydes: Synthesis of Amides, Hydroxamic Acids and Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry. A facile, mild and metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes and their conversion into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters was developed, using cheap household lamps as the light source and thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst.







Abstract
A cheap, facile and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes has been developed. Utilizing thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst and cheap household lamps as the light source, a variety of aromatic aldehydes have been activated and subsequently converted in a one&#8208;pot reaction into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters in good to high yields. The applicability of this method was highlighted in the synthesis of Moclobemide, a drug against depression and social anxiety. Extended and detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted, in order to determine a plausible mechanism for the reaction.

         <title>Supramolecular Coordination Cages Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Gold(I) Ligands and Their Precursors: Self&#8208;Assembly, Structural Transformation and Guest&#8208;Binding Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate heteroleptic V2E3 cages from two homoleptic cages with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly can also be formed by ligand displacement transformations from homoleptic assembly.







Abstract
The incorporation of functional groups into the cavity of discrete supramolecular coordination cages (SCCs) will bring unique functions and applications. Here, three dicarboxylate ligands (H2L1Cl, H2L2Cl and H2L3Cl) containing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors as linkers were introduced to construct SCCs by combining with two C3&#8208;symmertic (CpZr)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)3 clusters as three&#8208;connect vertices, resulted in a series of rugby&#8208;like V2E3 (V=vertex, E=edge) type homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;1, SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;3). However, V4E6&#8208;type tetrahedral cages (SCC&#8208;4 and SCC&#8208;5), incorporating six Au&#8208;NHC moieties, were obtained when the corresponding NHC&#8208;gold(I) functionalized ligands (H2L1Au, H2L2Au) were applied. For the first time, we present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V2E3 cage (SCC&#8208;6) from two homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;5) with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly SCC&#8208;6 can also be formed upon a subcomponent displacement strategy. The structural transformation and reassembly processes were detected and monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. The formation of heteroleptic assembly was further supported by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Moreover, homoleptic cage SCC&#8208;2 possesses a trigonal bipyramidal cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Putative Biosynthetic Intermediate Ambruticin J</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The family of anti&#8208;fungal natural products known as the ambruticins are structurally distinguished by a pair of pyran rings adorning a divinylcyclopropane core. Previous characterization of their biosynthesis, including the expression of a genetically modified producing organism, revealed that the polyketide synthase pathway proceeds through a diol intermediate, known as ambruticin J. Here we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of the putative PKS product, ambruticin J, via  a triply&#8208;convergent synthetic route featuring a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination for fragment assembly. This synthesis takes advantage of synthetic methodology, previously developed by our laboratory, for the stereoselective generation of the trisubstituted cyclopropyl linchpin.</dc:description>

         <title>The Long and Bright Path of a Lanthanide MOF: From Basics towards the Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic structural and optical changes of Tb&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks in the presence of aqueous fluoride solutions are reported in this work. The structural transformation of the MOF in the presence of fluorides was scrutinized by XRD, XAFS, and dynamic measurements of the Tb emission, and all the information was summarized in the development of a tech&#8208;demo. The cover shows &#8220;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&#8221; hinting at the flow between the different but connected states of the MOF when the fluoride concentration increases, first increasing the emission by replacement of Tb&#8722;OH groups in the MOF by Tb&#8722;F and later quenching the emission by the formation of TbF3. The cover image was designed by ScienceBrush Design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;H. Otal, M. Kimura, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005222).

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serotonin is an important signaling molecule with a high lipid membrane affinity. Membrane binding of serotonin modulates membrane properties and potentially cellular function as well, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. The results presented in this study suggest a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Huster, S. Maiti, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100328).

         <title>Click and Release Chemistry for Activity&#8208;Based Purification of &#946;&#8208;Lactam Targets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we functionalized carbapenem &#946;&#8208;lactams for the development of an original activity&#8208;based purification method of the complex targets of these drugs. The alkyne drug covalently bound to the target specifically reacted with an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and an iminosydnone for single&#8208;step elution and fluorescent labeling of the targets.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams, the cornerstone of antibiotherapy, inhibit multiple and partially redundant targets referred to as transpeptidases or penicillin&#8208;binding proteins. These enzymes catalyze the essential cross&#8208;linking step of the polymerization of cell wall peptidoglycan. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of &#946;&#8208;lactams and of resistance to these drugs requires the development of reliable methods to characterize their targets. Here, we describe an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. We synthesized alkyne&#8208;carbapenems with suitable properties with respect to the kinetics of acylation of a model target, the Ldtfm L,D&#8208;transpeptidase, the stability of the resulting acylenzyme, and the reactivity of the alkyne for the cycloaddition of an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and a bioorthogonal cleavable linker. The probe provided access to the fluorescent target in a single click and release step.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescent Helicene&#8208;Boranils: Synthesis, Photophysical and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicene&#8208;mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;boranils have been prepared in enantiopure forms. The chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism and optical rotation) and photophysical properties (unpolarized and circularly polarized luminescence) of these new chiral emissive helicenes have been studied both experimentally and theoretically and highlight their combined helical and axial chirality effects.







Abstract
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;boranil&#8208;substituted helicenes were prepared by BF2&#8208;borylation of the corresponding anils, readily synthesized by condensation of 2&#8208;amino&#8208; and 2,15&#8208;diamino&#8208;helicenes with 4&#8208;(diethylamino)salicylaldehyde. After enantiomeric resolution using HPLC, their chiroptical properties including circularly polarized fluorescence in solution and in PMMA films were investigated and rationalized with the help of NMR, X&#8208;ray and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Vapochromic Luminescent &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems with Reversible Coordination&#8208;Number Control of Hypervalent Tin(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Vapochromic luminescence of hypervalent tin(IV) complexes: Hypervalent tin(IV) complexes having deep&#8208;red emission can be synthesized. The critically narrow energy gap was attributed to three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bonds. Furthermore, dynamic and reversible color changes of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems were caused by coordination&#8208;number control of the hypervalent tin(IV) complexes. The color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation.







Abstract
The dynamic and reversible changes of coordination numbers between five and six in solution and solid states, based on hypervalent tin(IV)&#8208;fused azobenzene (TAz) complexes, are reported. It was found that the TAz complexes showed deep&#8208;red emission owing to the hypervalent bond composed of an electron&#8208;donating three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bond and an electron&#8208;accepting nitrogen&#8211;tin (N&#8211;Sn) coordination. Furthermore, hypsochromic shifts in optical spectra were observed in Lewis basic solvents because of alteration of the coordination number from five to six. In particular, vapochromic luminescence was induced by attachment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapor to the coordination point at the tin atom accompanied with a crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition. Additionally, the color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of vapochromic luminescence by using stable and variable coordination numbers of hypervalent bonds.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6945-6953, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6954-6962, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

. A simple synthetic protocol to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;substituted NDI &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird&#8208;Antiaromaticity, and Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet&#8208;State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>

Spin density guidelines: Characterization of T1 polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) reveals that spin density localizes on specific substructures, according to a hierarchy of motifs. A set of general guidelines is defined, allowing prediction of the location of spin density and Baird&#8208;antiaromaticity in PBHs of varying topology and, in addition, prediction of relative T1 energies and singlet&#8211;triplet gaps.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited&#8208;state compounds. Herein, the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin&#8208;density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state is studied. Although a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, a set of guidelines is defined to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri&#8208; and tetracyclic components, and subsequently tested on larger systems.

Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Metal&#8208;Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6917-6922, April 21, 2021. </description>

Liposomes deliver: Glucose was used as template for stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids that can exist in two conformational states. In the active ON state, a Zn2+ ion is complexed by the polar head group of the lipid. The inactive OFF state can be achieved by treating the active lipid with a metal chelator. The active lipids were incorporated into the membrane of liposomes containing a fluorescent cargo. In the presence of a metal chelator, a change in conformation of the incorporated lipids resulted in the release of the cargo from the liposomes, which suggests potential applications in drug delivery.







Abstract
Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial&#8208;based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterials for advanced targeted&#8208;delivery applications. Implementation of external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. This paper presents the synthesis of a carbohydrate&#8208;derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on the presence of Zn2+: an active state in the presence of Zn2+ ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn2+ or when exposed to Na2EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn2+ ions. This is the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a single&#8208;liposome study showed that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage&#8208;free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liposomes deliver&lt;/b&gt;: Glucose was used as template for stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids that can exist in two conformational states. In the active ON state, a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is complexed by the polar head group of the lipid. The inactive OFF state can be achieved by treating the active lipid with a metal chelator. The active lipids were incorporated into the membrane of liposomes containing a fluorescent cargo. In the presence of a metal chelator, a change in conformation of the incorporated lipids resulted in the release of the cargo from the liposomes, which suggests potential applications in drug delivery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial&#8208;based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterials for advanced targeted&#8208;delivery applications. Implementation of external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. This paper presents the synthesis of a carbohydrate&#8208;derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: an active state in the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or when exposed to Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This is the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a single&#8208;liposome study showed that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage&#8208;free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes. On addition of EDTA to the liposomes, their fluorescent cargo could be released as a result of the membrane&#8208;incorporated lipids undergoing a conformational change.&lt;/p&gt;

Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6985-6992, April 21, 2021. </description>

An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An eight&#8208;connected&lt;/b&gt; metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow fluorescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Liu, A. Tong, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100406).

Structure, sequence, spin: The structures of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons are analyzed in terms of the sequence of tricyclic annulations, revealing regularities in the location of spin density and Baird&#8208;antiaromaticity. The two properties localize onto specific tri&#8208; and tetracyclic substructures according to a hierarchy: linear, zig&#8208;zag, curved. The same preferences are reflected in the relative energy of the T1 systems and in the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Gershoni&#8208;Poranne et&#8197;al. on page 6923.

         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry, especially ball&#8208;milling, is still lacking a systematic and mechanistic understanding. Success is thus also governed by chance. As a result, only a few scientists dare to play in this field and try their fate. Nonetheless, such a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error basis has led quite often to remarkable discoveries, such as the synthesis of interesting nanostructured catalyst materials, unusual phases, or complex composites, often surpassing in convenience the traditional methods typically applied by default. For more information, see the Review by F. Sch&#252;th et&#8197;al. on page 6819.

         <title>Frontispiece: Intermediate Valence States in Lanthanide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. In their Minireview on page 6860, Thomas Simler, Gr&#233;gory Nocton and colleagues highlight the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes, detail the models used to rationalise them and show how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intermediate valence states in lanthanide&lt;/b&gt; compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. In their Minireview on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202004735"&gt;page 6860&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas Simler, Gr&#233;gory Nocton and colleagues highlight the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes, detail the models used to rationalise them and show how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations.

         <title>Frontispiece: Permanganyl Fluoride: A Brief History of the Molecule MnO3F and of Those Who Cared For It</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permanganyl fluoride's existence at the stability threshold in the series of oxides and oxide fluorides of the late 3d transition metals is reflected by its experimentally challenging properties. The Review article by Hubert Schmidbaur and W.&#8197;H.&#8197;Eugen Schwarz on page 6848 deals with the history of this molecule and takes the reader through early qualitative observations and the growing scattered information on its chemical and physical properties to the accurate determination and interpretation of its molecular structure and spectral features.

Hydroaminoalkylation! In this work, the conversion of alkynes into allylic amines within an unbelievably short reaction time of 4&#8197;h is presented. In addition to the fast reaction, hydroaminoalkylation is promoted by broad scope, high yields, and excellent stereoselectivity to provide access to synthetically useful products in record time. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Beckhaus, S. Doye, et&#8197;al. on page 6899.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids based on a glucose head group could promote pore formation in the membrane of liposomes upon treatment with EDTA. Using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup, it was possible to monitor the release of a fluorescent dye from liposomes containing the metal chelator&#8208;responsive lipids. The liposomes containing the lipids remained stable and able to incapsulate the cargo in the absence of EDTA. Only when introducing the metal chelating EDTA to the liposomes would they release their cargo through pores formed in their membrane. This could serve as a platform for future drug&#8208;delivery systems. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;M. Pedersen et&#8197;al. on page 6917.

         <title>Permanganyl Fluoride: A Brief History of the Molecule MnO3F and of Those Who Cared For It</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6848-6859, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permanganyl fluoride is positioned at the stability threshold of the metal oxide fluorides of the 3d elements in their highest oxidation states. The history of this compound reflects the experimental and theoretical challenges faced by scientists over two centuries. The spectroscopic features of the molecule with its apparently simple closed&#8208;shell configuration [Mn7+(d0), 3&#215;O2&#8722;(p6), F1&#8722;(p6)] reveal an extremely complex electronic structure with non&#8208;innocent ligands exerting an inverted ligand field.







Abstract
Permanganyl fluoride's existence at the stability threshold in the series of oxides and oxide fluorides of the late 3d transition metals is reflected by its experimentally challenging properties and by the difficulties posed in the theoretical description of its bonding characteristics. The history of this molecule is reviewed from early qualitative observations and the growing scattered information on its chemical and physical properties to the accurate determination and interpretation of its molecular structure and spectral features. The still problematic theoretical models for MnO4&#8722; and MnO3F are briefly presented in the broader context of the chemistry of elements in high oxidation states. Short biographies of the scientists engaged in these studies are offered. Related technetium and rhenium compounds are briefly considered for comparison.

Intermediate valence states: This review summarizes the spectroscopic and magnetic singularities gathered over more than 50 years and pointing to intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds. This substantial body of evidence, supported by advanced computational studies, bolsters ground&#8208;state multiconfigurational behaviour. Understanding and tuning these effects through symmetry and energy considerations paves the way to novel and unusual reactivities.







Abstract
Over more than 50&#8197;years, intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Such experimental singularities could not be rationalised until new theoretical models involving multiconfigurational electronic ground states were established. In this minireview, the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes are highlighted, the models used to rationalise them are detailed and how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations is considered. Understanding and tuning the ground&#8208;state multiconfigurational behaviour in lanthanide complexes may open new doors to modular and unusual reactivities.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6819-6847, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical routes enable the synthesis of different families of catalytic materials in a more sustainable and convenient way than classical methods. In addition, unusual properties may arise, leading to improved catalytic performance. The review covers the major achievements in the synthesis of catalysts assisted by mechanochemistry, discusses associated aspects, and provides perspectives.







Abstract
The mechanochemical synthesis of nanomaterials for catalytic applications is a growing research field due to its simplicity, scalability, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Besides, it provides materials with distinct features, such as nanocrystallinity, high defect concentration, and close interaction of the components in a system, which are, in most cases, unattainable by conventional routes. Consequently, this research field has recently become highly popular, particularly for the preparation of catalytic materials for various applications, ranging from chemical production over energy conversion catalysis to environmental protection. In this Review, recent studies on mechanochemistry for the synthesis of catalytic materials are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the straightforwardness of the mechanochemical route&#8212;in contrast to more conventional synthesis&#8212;in fabricating the materials, which otherwise often require harsh conditions. Distinct material properties achieved by mechanochemistry are related to their improved catalytic performance.

Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. In this minireview, the viscosity&#8208;sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities for the development of viscosity&#8208;specific fluorescent probes will be discussed.







Abstract
Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. Recently, precise visualization of viscosity has started to arouse more and more interest. However, owing to the complicated character, it is still a huge challenge to directly observe viscosity in living systems. In this regard, mounting fluorescence probes are being increasingly fabricated to map viscosity inside live cells and small animals. In this minireview, the viscosity&#8208;sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities for the development of viscosity&#8208;specific fluorescent probes will be discussed.

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6904-6910, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6899-6903, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic amines are directly formed from secondary amines and alkynes in the presence of highly active titanium catalysts. The corresponding hydroaminoalkylation reactions, which take place by C&#8722;H bond activation at sp3&#8208;centers in the &#945;&#8208;position to a nitrogen atom, can be achieved with internal and terminal alkynes, and best results are obtained with N&#8208;benzylaniline derivatives.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of alkynes with secondary amines, which selectively give access to allylic amines with E configuration of the alkene unit, are achieved in the presence of titanium catalysts. Successful reactions of symmetrically substituted diaryl&#8208; and dialkylalkynes as well as a terminal alkyne take place with N&#8208;benzylanilines, N&#8208;alkylanilines, and N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines.

         <title>CoS2/N&#8208;doped Hollow Spheres as Anode Material for High Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we first synthesized polyacrylic acid (PAA) spheres and used PAA as a template to load Co(OH)  2  particles on its surface. The product of CoS  2  nanoparticles dispersed in N&#8208;doped hollow spheres (N&#8208;HCS) was prepared through sulfurization treatment (CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS). During the sulfuration process, S will penetrate into the PAA and be embedded in the graphite layer along with the carbonization process. It was found that during the charging and discharging process, the S in the carbon layer will gradually dissolve out, thereby forming new ion diffusion channels in the carbon spheres and exposing more CoS  2  active sites. CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS composite exhibits a specific capacity of 729.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g  &#8208;1  .

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we first synthesized polyacrylic acid (PAA) spheres and used PAA as a template to load Co(OH)  2  particles on its surface. The product of CoS  2  nanoparticles dispersed in N&#8208;doped hollow spheres (N&#8208;HCS) was prepared through sulfurization treatment (CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS). During the sulfuration process, S will penetrate into the PAA and be embedded in the graphite layer along with the carbonization process. It was found that during the charging and discharging process, the S in the carbon layer will gradually dissolve out, thereby forming new ion diffusion channels in the carbon spheres and exposing more CoS  2  active sites. CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS composite exhibits a specific capacity of 729.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g  &#8208;1  . The sodium storage mechanism and reaction kinetics of the materials were further measured by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, capacitance performance evaluation and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The excellent cycling performance and rate capability demonstrated that the CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS is a potential and prospective anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Fe&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Ligand Conformation Regulation for Efficient Dye&#160;Adsorption and C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting the ligands reasonably is expected to enhance the interaction of MOFs on special molecules/ions, which has significant application value for the selective adsorption of guest molecules. In this work, two tricarboxylic ligands H3L&#8208;Cl and H3L&#8208;NH2 were designed and synthesized based on the ligand H3TTCA by replacing part of the benzene rings with C=C bonds and modifying the chlorine and amino groups on the 4&#8208;position of the benzene ring. Two 3D Fe&#8208;MOFs (UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2) with the novel topology types were constructed. As the C=C bonds of the ligands have flexible torsion angles, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl features three types of irregular 2D channels, while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 has a cage with two types of windows on the surface. The synergistic effect of unique channels and modification of functional groups endows UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 with high adsorption capacity for organic dyes. UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl shows high adsorption capacity for CV (147.2 mg g&#8208;1), RHB (100.3 mg g&#8208;1), and MO (220.9 mg g&#8208;1), while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 exhibits selective adsorption of MO (158.7 mg g&#8208;1). Meanwhile, based on the&#160;diverse pore structure and modification of active sites, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 show the selective separation of equimolar C2H2/CO2. Therefore, reasonable regulation of organic ligands plays a significant role in guiding the structure diversification and performance improvement of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrophilic  11  C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, obtained by carbonylative cross coupling of aryl halides with [  11  C]carbon monoxide, were prepared for the first time and shown to be valuable intermediates in the synthesis of primary [  11  C]benzamides. The methodology furnished a set of benzamide model compounds, including the two poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors niraparib and veliparib, in moderate to excellent radiochemical yields. In addition to providing a convenient and practical route to primary&#160;[  11  C]benzamides, the current methodology paves the way for future application of [  11  C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium halide salts in PET tracer synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Catalytically Active Species in POM&#8208;catalysed DNA&#8208;model Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphoester hydrolysis is an important chemical step in DNA repair. One archetypal molecular model of phosphoesters is para&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). It has been shown previously that the presence of molecular metal oxide [Mo  7  O  24  ]  6&#8211;  may catalyse the hydrolysis of pNPP through the partial decomposition of polyoxomolybdate framework resulting in a [(PO  4  )  2  Mo  5  O  15  ]  6&#8211;  product. Real&#8208;time monitoring of the catalytic system using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) provided a glance into the species present in the reaction mixture and identification of potential catalytic candidates. Following up on the obtained spectrometric data, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to characterise the hypothetical intermediate [Mo  5  O  15  (pNPP)  2  (H  2  O)  6  ]  6&#8211;  that would be required to form under the hypothesised transformation. Surprisingly, our results point to the dimeric [Mo  2  O  8  ]  4&#8211;  anion resulting from the decomposition of [Mo  7  O  24  ]  6&#8211;  as the active catalytic species involved in the hydrolysis of pNPP rather than the originally assumed {Mo  5  O  15  } species. A similar study was carried out involving the same species but substituting Mo by W. The mechanism involving W species showed a higher barrier and less stable products in agreement with the non&#8208;catalytic effect found in experimental results</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of highly substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine, was synthesized from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes with variously substituted alkynes. 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaborole complexes, which are accessible by phosphine addition to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes, were also found to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines and readily reacted with alkynyl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines to generate new regioisomers of bi&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines, which feature directly connected aromatic rings. Their molecular structures, which can be viewed as boron&#8208;nitrogen isosteres of biphenyls, show nearly perpendicular 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings. The new method using rhodacycles instead of 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes as precursors is shown to be more effective, allowing the synthesis of a wider range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new base metal iron&#8208;cobalt dyad is presented, connecting a heteroleptic tetra&#8209;NHC iron(II) photosensitizer combining a 2,6&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]pyridine) with 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyridine ligand, and a cobaloxime catalyst. This iron(II)&#8208;cobalt(III) assembly is characterized by ground and excited state methods like X&#8209;ray crystallography, X&#8209;ray absorption spectroscopy, (spectro&#8209;)electrochemistry, and steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved optical absorption spectroscopy, with a focus on the stability of the assembly in solution and the determination of the excited state landscape. NMR and UV&#8209;Vis spectroscopy reveal dissociation of the dyad in acetonitrile at concentrations below 1 mM and high photostability. Transient absorption spectroscopy after excitation into the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption band suggests a relaxation cascade originating from hot singlet and triplet &#160;MLCT states, leading to the population of the  3  MLCT state that exhibits the longest lifetime. Decay into the ground state finally involves a  3MC state. The attachment of cobaloxime to the iron photosensitizer increases the  3MLCT lifetime at the iron center. Together with the directing effect of the linker, this potentially makes the dyad more active in photocatalytic proton reduction experiments than the analogue two&#8208;component system, consisting of the iron photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl. This work thus sheds new light on the functionality of base metal dyads, important for more efficient and sustainable future proton reduction systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Validation of Ab&#8208;initio&#8208;predicted Magnetic Anisotropies and Magneto&#8208;structural Correlations in Linear Hetero&#8208;trinuclear DyIII&#8208;NiII2 Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported are single crystal SQUID and single crystal high&#8208;frequency / high&#8208;field EPR data of a trinuclear complex with a rare six&#8208;coordinate coordination sphere of a DyIII center coupled to two terminal six&#8208;coordinate NiII ions. The analysis of the single crystal spectroscopic parameters allows for an accurate description of the ground state wavefunction. The experimental analysis is supplemented by the analysis of the paramagnetic NMR spectra, allowing for a thorough description of the DyIII center. The experimental data are interpreted on the basis of an ab initio ligand field analysis, and the computed parameters are in good agreement with the experimental observations. This supports the quality of the theoretical approach based on a pseudo&#8208;spin Hamiltonian for the electronic ground state. Further support emerges from the ab initio ligand field theory based analysis of structurally very similar system that, in contrast to the complex reported here, shows single molecule magnetic properties, and this is in agreement with the quantum&#8208;chemical prediction and analysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subnanoparticles (SNPs) with sizes of ~1 nm are attractive for enhancing the catalytic performance of transition metals and their oxides. &#160; Such SNPs are of particular interest as redox&#8208;active catalysts in selective oxidative reactions. &#160; However, the electronic states and oxophilicity of copper oxide SNPs are still a subject of debate in terms of their redox properties during oxidation reactions for hydrocarbons. &#160; In this work,  in situ  X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure  (XAFS) measurements of Cu  28  O  x  SNPs, which were prepared using a dendritic phenylazomethine template, during temperatureprogrammed reduction (TPR) with H  2  achieved lowering of the temperature (  T  50  = 138 &#176;C) reported thus far for the Cu(II) &#8594; Cu(I) reduction reaction because of Cu&#8211;O bond elongation in the ultrasmall copper oxide particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials have been investigated as efficient photochromic platforms for detecting hazardous radiation, while the utilization of hydrogen bonded&#8208;organic frameworks (HOFs) in this field has remained intact. Herein, two HOFs were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of tetratopic viologen ligand and formic acid (PFC&#8208;25, PFC&#8208;26), as a new class of &#8220;all&#8208;organic&#8221; radiochromic smart materials, opening a gate for HOFs in this desired field. PFC&#8208;26 is active upon both X&#8208;rays and UV light, while PFC&#8208;25 is only active upon X&#8208;rays. The same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors of PFC&#8208;25 and PFC&#8208;26 allow us to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the factors that control the detection specificity. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of viologen ligand is highly related to the threshold energy of triggering a charge transfer, therefore being a vital factor for the particularity of radiochromic materials. Thanks to its convenient processibility, nanoparticle size, and UV silence, PFC&#8208;25 can be further fabricated into a portable naked&#8208;eye sensor for X&#8208;ray detection, which shows obvious color change with the merits of high transmittance contrast, good sensitivity (reproducible dose threshold of 3.5 Gy), and excellent stability. The work exhibits the promising practical potentials of HOF materials in photochromic technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifaceted Mickey Mouse Amphiphiles for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly, DNA Complexation and Organ&#8208;Selective Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Instilling segregated cationic and lipophilic domains with an angular disposition in a trehalose&#8208;based trifaceted macrocyclic scaffold allows engineering patchy molecular nanoparticles leveraging directional interactions that emulate those controlling self&#8208;assembling processes in viral capsids. The resulting trilobular amphiphilic derivatives, featuring a Mickey Mouse architecture, can electrostatically interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and further engage in hydrophobic contacts to promote condensation into transfectious nanocomplexes. Notably, the topology and internal structure of the cyclooligosaccharide/pDNA co&#8208;assemblies can be molded by fine&#8208;tuning the valency and characteristics of the cationic and lipophilic patches, which strongly impacts the transfection efficacy  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Outstanding organ selectivities can then be programmed with no need of incorporating a biorecognizable motif in the formulation. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse nonviral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes by making cyclooligosaccharide patchiness the focus.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Selective Formation of D2 Symmetric Octanuclear Organometallic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of organometallic half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III)&#8208; and rhodium(III)&#8208;based building blocks with asymmetric ambidentate pyridyl&#8208;carboxylate ligands. Despite the potential for obtaining a statistical mixture of multiple products,  D  2  symmetric octanuclear cages were formed selectively by taking advantage of the electronic effects emanating from the two types of chelating sites &#8213; (  O  ,  O&#8242;  ) and (  N  ,  N&#8242;  ) &#8213; on the tetranuclear building blocks. The metal sources and the lengths of bridging ligands show influence on the selectivity of the self&#8208;assembly. Experimental observations, supported by computational studies, suggest that the  D  2  symmetric cages are the thermodynamically favoured products. Overall, the results underline the importance of electronic effects on the selectivity of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, and demonstrate that asymmetric ambidentate ligands can be used to control the design of discrete supramolecular coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Relay&#8208;Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Alkenyl Halides and Unsaturated Alcohols in the Synthesis of Open&#8208;Chain Analogues of Musk Odorant Vulcanolide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a whole range of alkenols of different chain lengths linking the alkene and the alcohol, affording unsaturated aldehydes and ketones in moderate to good yields. In contrast, alkenyl triflates were not suitable partners for this reaction. This methodology allowed for the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide, several of which retained key olfactory properties of the parent molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilisation of [WVF4]+ by N&#8208; and P&#8208;Donor Ligands: Second&#8208;Order Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in Octacoordinate d1 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first isolated examples of cationic fluoridotungsten(V) complexes are reported as octacoordinate [WF  4  (L)  4  ]  +  (L = C  5  H  5  N, P(CH  3  )  3  ). The [WF  4  (NC  5  H  5  )  4  ]  +  cation is synthesised as its [O  3  SCF  3  ]  &#8211;  salt upon reaction of WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  with [(CH  3  )  3  Si(NC  5  H  5  )][O  3  SCF  3  ] in excess C  5  H  5  N, whereas [WF  4  {P(CH  3  )  3  }  4  ]  +  is accessed directly from WF  6  upon reaction with (CH  3  )  3  SiO  3  SCF  3  and excess P(CH  3  )  3  . These salts were characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state. New geometry indices for octacoordinate complexes (&#964;  8  and &#964;  8  &#8242;) are introduced, allowing for the facile differentiation of trigonal&#8208;dodecahedral (TD) and square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries. This has disambiguated the SA geometries of [WF  4  (L)  4  ]  +  and the geometries of a series of previously reported  d  0  and  d  1  MA  4  B  4  complexes. Computational (DFT&#8208;B3LYP) studies of [WF  4  (PH  3  )  4  ]  2+/+  and related model systems demonstrate the occurrence of a second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller (SOJT) distortion from TD in  d  0  complexes to SA in  d  1  complexes, with the degree of SOJT stabilisation being most significant in 5  d  complexes containing fluorido ligands and monodentate neutral donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effects in Halogen and Hydrogen Bonding Mediated Electrochemical Anion Sensing in Aqueous Solution and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing anionic species in competitive aqueous media is a well&#8208;recognised challenge to long&#8208;term applications across a multitude of fields. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of the electrochemical anion sensing performance of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) bis&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;(iodo)triazole receptors in solution and at self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), in a range of increasingly competitive aqueous organic solvent media (ACN/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). In solution, the XB sensor notably outperforms the HB sensor, with substantial anion recognition induced cathodic voltammetric responses of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple persisting even in highly competitive aqueous solvent media of 20% water content. The response to halides, in particular, shows a markedly lower sensitivity to increasing water content associated with a unique halide selectivity at unprecedented levels of solvent polarity. The HB sensor, in contrast, generally displayed a preference towards oxoanions. A significant surface&#8208;enhancement effect was observed for both XB/HB receptive films in all solvent systems, whereby the HB sensor generally displayed larger responses towards oxoanions than its halogen bonding analogue.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;3&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)]quinoxalines with concomitant 1,2&#8208;silyl shift gives rise to the formation of 6&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to excellent yield. These silylated heterocycles are readily transformed into 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to good yield by one&#8208;pot ipso&#8208;iodination&#8208;Suzuki coupling synthesis. The title compounds represent a novel type of tunable luminophores. Structure&#8208;property relationships for 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines obtained by Hammett correlations with &#963;p+ substituent parameters indicate that emission maxima, Stokes shifts, and fluorescence quantum yields can be fine&#8208;tuned by the remote para&#8208;aryl substituent. Furthermore, indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines were found to exhibit interesting activities against medically relevant pathogens such as the Apicomplexa parasite Toxoplasma gondii with IC50 up to 0.67 &#177; 0.13 &#181;M. Therefore, these compounds are promising candidates for novel anti&#8208;parasitic therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Ligands in Dissolution of Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of new, environmentally benign dissolution methods for metallic gold is driven by needs in the circular economy. Gold is widely used in consumer electronics, but sustainable and selective dissolution methods for Au are scarce. Herein we describe a quantitative dissolution of gold in organic solution under mild conditions using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. In the dissolution reaction, two thiol ligands, pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, work in a cooperative manner. The mechanistic investigations suggest that two pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol molecules form a complex with Au0 that can be oxidized, while the role of inexpensive 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole is to stabilize the formed AuI species via a ligand exchange process. Under optimized conditions, the reaction proceeds vigorously and gold dissolves quantitatively in an hour. The demonstrated ligand exchange mechanism with two thiols allows us to drastically reduce the thiol consumption and may lead to even more effective gold dissolution methods in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of the Self&#8208;folding Cavitand&#160; Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational equilibria and guest exchange process of a resorcin[4]arene derived self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor have been characterized in detail by molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and  1  H EXSY experiments. A multi&#8208;timescale strategy for exploring the fluxional behaviour of this system has been constructed, exploiting conventional MD and accelerated MD (aMD) techniques. The use of aMD allows the reconstruction of the folding/unfolding process of the receptor by sampling high&#8208;energy barrier processes unattainable by conventional MD simulations. We obtained MD trajectories sampling events occurring at different timescales from ns to s: 1) rearrangement of the directional hydrogen bond seam stabilizing the receptor, 2) folding/unfolding of the structure transiting partially open intermediates, and c) guest departure from different folding stages. Most remarkably, reweighing of the biased aMD simulations provided kinetic barriers that are in very good agreement with those determined experimentally by  1  H NMR. These results constitute the first comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamic features of cavitand receptors. Our approach emerges as a valuable rational design tool for synthetic host&#8208;guest systems</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid and Mild Sulfation Strategy Reveals Conformational Preferences in Therapeutically Relevant Sulfated Xylooligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although sulfated xylooligosaccharides are promising therapeutic leads for a multitude of afflictions, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of commercially deployed forms (e.g. Pentosan polysulfate&#160;1) complicates their path to further clinical development. We describe herein the preparation of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers prepared to date&#8212;comprising up to eight xylose residues&#8212;as homogeneous standards for biological studies. Near quantitative sulfation was accomplished using a remarkably mild and operationally simple protocol which avoids the need for high temperatures and a large excess of the sulfating reagent. Moreover, the sulfated xylooligomer standards so obtained enabled definitive identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a sample of a commercially prepared Pentosan drug and provided significant insights into the conformational preferences of the constituent persulfated monosaccharide residues. As the spatial&#160;distribution of sulfates is a key determinant of the binding of sulfated oligosaccharides to endogenous targets, these findings have broad implications for the advancement of Pentosan&#8208;based treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Ligand Functionalization of Photocatalytic Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phase Transfer and Self&#8208;Assembly Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles of TiO  2  , ZnO, WO  3  and CuO with amine&#8208;terminated (oleylamine) and thiol&#8208;terminated (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) alkyl chained ligands was studied under ambient conditions. A high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds stably to only TiO  2  and WO  3  , while 1&#8208;dodecanethiol binds stably only to ZnO and CuO. Similarly, polar to non&#8208;polar solvent phase transfer of TiO  2  and WO  3  nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not by 1&#8208;dodecanethiol, while the contrary holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface chemistry of ligand functionalized nanoparticles was probed by ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy, that enabled to elucidate the occupation of the ligands at the active sites. The photo&#8208;stability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface was determined by the photocatalytic self&#8208;cleaning properties of the material. While TiO  2  and WO  3  degrade the ligands within 24 hours under both UV and visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example, since the ligand functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they can thus be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface, for obtaining nanoparticle films with demonstrated photocatalytic as well as anti&#8208;fogging properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Many studies on cerium compounds relate back to CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 when it comes to assigning the metal oxidation state and other ground&#8208;state wavefunction characteristics. It was therefore very important to establish, from first principles, how the ground states and the core&#8208;excited states in the different peaks exactly relate to each other. The Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 have never been calculated without prior assumptions about the excited states or within an ab initio formalism that considers explicitly the differential wavefunction relaxation of the ground&#8208;states and the core&#8208;excited states. We decided to take this task upon us.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Prof. Jochen Autschbach and Dr. Dumitru&#8208;Claudiu Sergentu of State University of New York at Buffalo, and Dr. Corwin H. Booth of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The image depicts high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray beams as lightnings probing Ce at the L3 edge in the iconic covalent&#8208;bonded Ce(C8H8)2 and in CeO2. The mountain peaks in the background represent the double&#8208;peaked L3 edges. The peaks turn out to be intuitively interpreted in terms of localized orbitals and hence metal oxidation states.

         <title>The Development of Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Oligosaccharide Activity&#8208;Based Inactivators for Endoglycanases: A Case Study on&#160;a&#8208;1,6 Mannanases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a vast genomic resource for enzymes active on carbohydrates. Lagging far behind, however, are functional chemical tools for the rapid characterization of carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes. Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) offer one chemical solution to these issues with ABPs based upon cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine covalent and irreversible inhibitors representing a potent and widespread approach. Such inhibitors for enzymes active on polysaccharides are potentially limited by the requirement for several glycosidic bonds, themselves substrates for the enzyme targets. Here we show that non&#8208;hydrolysable trisaccharide can be synthesized and applied even to enzymes with challenging subsite requirements. We find that incorporation of carbasugar moieties, which we accomplished by cuprate&#8208;assisted regioselective trans&#8208;diaxial epoxide opening of carba&#8208;mannal we synthesised for this purpose, yields inactivators that act as powerful activity&#8208;based inhibitors for&#160;a&#8208;1,6&#160;endo&#8208;mannanases. 3&#8208;D structures at 1.35 &#8211; 1.47&#160;&#197;&#160;resolutions confirm the design rationale and binding to the enzymatic nucleophile. Carbasugar oligosaccharide cyclophellitols offer a powerful new approach for the design of robust endoglycosidase inhibitors, while the synthesis procedures presented here should allow adaptation towards activity&#8208;based endoglycosidase probes as well as configurational isosteres targeting other endoglycosidase families.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) Pyridyl Amino&#8208;Phenolates: Hypoxia&#8208;Selective, Nucleus Targeting Cytotoxins, and Magnetic Resonance Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting of low&#8208;oxygen (hypoxic) environments found in many tumors using redox&#8208;active metal complexes is a strategy that can enhance efficacy and reduce side effects of chemotherapies. We have developed a series of Cu(II) complexes with tridentate pyridine aminophenolate&#8208;based ligands for preferential activation in the reduction window provided by hypoxic tissues. Furthermore, ligand functionalization with a CF3&#160;pendant group provides a 19F spectroscopic handle for magnetic resonance studies of redox processes at the metal centre and behaviour in cellular environments. The phenol group in the ligand backbone was substituted at the para&#8208;position with H, Cl, and NO2  &#160;&#160;  to modulate the reduction potential of the Cu(II) centre, giving a range of values below the window expected for hypoxic tissues. The NO2&#160;substituted complex, which has the highest reduction potential, showed enhanced cytotoxic selectivity towards HeLa cells grown in hypoxic conditions. Cell death occurs via apoptosis, as determined by cell morphology analysis. A combination of 19F NMR and ICP&#8208;OES indicates localization of the NO2&#160;complex in HeLa cell nuclei and increased cellular accumulation under hypoxia. This correlates with DNA nuclease activity being the likely origin of cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated by cleavage of DNA plasmids in the presence of the Cu(II) nitro complex and a reducing agent. Selective detection of the paramagnetic Cu(II) complexes and their diamagnetic ligands through 19F MRI suggests hypoxia targeting theranostic applications via redox activation.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of N, O, P&#8208;doped Hierarchical Porous Carbon from Poly&#8208;bis(phenoxy)phosphazene for Polysulfide&#8208;Trapping Interlayer in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shuttling of polysulfides is the most detrimental problem that degrades the capacity and cycle stability of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Adding a carbon interlayer is feasible to prevent the polysulfides from migration, and a rational design of the structures and surface properties of the carbon layer is the essential enabler to increasing its effectiveness. Here, we report a hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) via carbonization of  bis(phenoxy)phosphazene  and in&#8208;situ doping of triple heteroatoms into the carbon lattice for fabricating an effective polysulfide&#8208;trapping interlayer. The generated carbon integrates the advantages of the hierarchical porous structure, high specific area and rich dopants (N, O and P), yielding chemisorption and physical confinement for polysulfides  and fast ion&#8208;transport synergistically  . The HPC interlayer significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;S batteries, including  an exceptional discharge capacity  of  1509 mA h/g at 0.06C  and a high capacity retention of 83.7% after 250 cycles at 0.3C  . This work proposes a facile in&#8208;situ synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon with rational porous structures for suppressing the shuttle effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Look at the Synthetic Methodologies of Photoluminescent Nanoparticulate Carbon Quantum Dots and Corresponding Photophysical Properties1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of synthetic methodologies and applications of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been reported since they were first discovered nearly two decades ago. Unlike metal&#8208;based or semiconductor&#8208;based (e.g., metal chalcogenides) quantum dots (MSQDs), CQDs have the unique feature of being prepared through a variety of synthetic protocols, which are typically understood from considerations of reaction models and photoluminescence mechanisms. Consequently, this brief review article describes quantum dots, in general, and CQDs, in particular, from various viewpoints: (i) their definition, (ii) their photophysical properties, and (iii) the superiority of CQDs over MSQDs. Where possible, comparisons are made between CQDs and MSQDs. First, however, the review begins with a general brief description of quantum dots (QDs) as nanomaterials (sizes &#8804; 10 nm), followed by a short description of MSQDs and CQDs. Described subsequently are the various top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches to synthesize CQDs followed by their distinctive photophysical properties (emission spectra; quantum yields, &#934;s).</dc:description>

         <title>Axial Ligand Coordination Tuning of Electrocatalytic Activity of Iron Porphyrin Electrografted on Carbon Nanotubes for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential in many life processes and energy conversion systems. Inspired by enzymatic oxygen activation/reduction processes, it is desirable to design transition metal molecular catalysts as an alternative to noble&#8208;metal&#8208;Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts in view point of fuel cell commercialization. Herein, we fabricate bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts electrografted on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), where iron porphyrin FeF  20  TPP&#160; is coordinated with covalently electrografted axial ligand on the MWCNTs&#8217; surface varying from thiophene to imidazole. With the change of axial coordination environment, the catalysts&#8217; electrocatalytic activity varied accordingly, and the imidazole coordinated catalyst MWCNTs&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF  20  TPP exhibited the highest ORR activity among the prepared catalysts. When MWCNTs&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF  20  TPP was loaded on the cathode of a zinc&#8211;air battery assembly, open&#8208;cell voltage (OCV) of 1.35 V and the maximum power density (  P  max  ) of 110 mW cm  &#8722;2  were achieved, which was higher than those of MWCNTs&#8208;Thi&#8208;FeF  20  TPP (OCV = 1.30 V,  P  max  = 100 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) and MWCNTs&#8208;Ox&#8208;FeF  20  TPP (OCV = 1.28 V,  P  max  = 86 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) and comparable with that loaded with a Pt/C catalyst (OCV = 1.45 V,  P  max  = 120 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) under similar experimental conditions. This study provides a time&#8208;saving method to prepare covalently immobilized molecular electrocatalysts on carbon&#8208;based materials with structure&#8211;performance correlation, which is also applicable to the design of other electrografted catalysts for energy conversion.</dc:description>

When MWCNTs&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF  20  TPP was loaded on the cathode of a zinc&#8211;air battery assembly, open&#8208;cell voltage (OCV) of 1.35 V and the maximum power density (  P  max  ) of 110 mW cm  &#8722;2  were achieved, which was higher than those of MWCNTs&#8208;Thi&#8208;FeF  20  TPP (OCV = 1.30 V,  P  max  = 100 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) and MWCNTs&#8208;Ox&#8208;FeF  20  TPP (OCV = 1.28 V,  P  max  = 86 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) and comparable with that loaded with a Pt/C catalyst (OCV = 1.45 V,  P  max  = 120 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) under similar experimental conditions. This study provides a time&#8208;saving method to prepare covalently immobilized molecular electrocatalysts on carbon&#8208;based materials with structure&#8211;performance correlation, which is also applicable to the design of other electrografted catalysts for energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Passivation: Sodium Borohydride Synthesis by Reacting Hydrated Borax with Aluminium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant obstacle in the large&#8208;scale applications of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) for hydrogen storage is its high cost. Herein, we report a new method to synthesize NaBH4  by ball milling hydrated sodium tetraborate (Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O) with low&#8208;cost Al or Al88Si12, instead of Na, Mg or Ca. An effective strategy is developed to facilitate mass transfer during the reaction by introducing NaH to enable the formation of NaAlO2  instead of dense Al2O3  on Al surface, and by using Si as a milling additive to prevent agglomeration and also break up passivation layers. Another advantage of this process is that hydrogen in Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O serves as a hydrogen source for NaBH4  generation. Considering the low cost of the starting materials and simplicity in operation, our studies demonstrate the potential of producing NaBH4  in a more economical way than the commercial process.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Structure&#8211;Property Relationship Modelling for the Prediction of Singlet Oxygen Generation by Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free sensitizers forming long&#8208;living triplet excited states  via  the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process have potential to replace transition metal complexes in photonic applications. The efficiency of SOCT&#8208;ISC in BODIPY donor&#8208;acceptor dyads can be tuned by structural modification. Predicting the triplet state yields and reactive oxygen species generation quantum yields in a particular solvent is challenging due to a lack of quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship (QSPR) models. We analyzed data on  1  O  2  generation quantum yields (&#934;  &#916;  ) for &gt;70 heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY in toluene, acetonitrile, and THF. To build reliable QSPR models, we synthesized new BODIPYs containing different electron donating groups, studied their optical and structural properties and the solvent dependence of  1 O2  , which confirmed the formation of triplet states via SOCT&#8208;ISC. More than 5000 quantum&#8208;chemical descriptors were calculated including descriptors using DFT, namely M06&#8208;2X functional. QSPR models predicting &#934;&#916; values were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), which perform significantly better than other machine learning methods and show sufficient statistical parameters (R = 0.88 &#822; 0.91 and q  2  = 0.62 &#822; 0.69) for all three solvents. A small root mean squared error of 8.2% was obtained for &#934;&#916;  values predicted using MLR model in toluene. QSPR and machine learning techniques can be useful for predicting &#934;&#916; values in different media and virtual screening of new heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs with improved photosensitizing ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;supporting Atmosphere Assisted Synthesis of 1D Mo2C&#8208;based Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials exhibit fascinating properties in electrocatalytic applications but their fabrication faces the challenge of tedious and complicated operations. Herein, we develop a bottom&#8208;up strategy to construct 1D metal carbide catalyst (Mo2C@NC) consisting of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers via simply calcining a mixture of ammonium molybdate, urea and melamine. Experimental results and thermodynamic calculations demonstrate the retainable pyrolysis&#8208;generated self&#8208;supporting atmosphere plays a crucial role in the crystalline phase and morphology of materials. When functioned as an electrocatalyst for HER, the achieved Mo2C@NC presents an excellent catalytic activity as well as outstanding stability. This work may shed fresh light into the facile synthesis of effective HER catalysts with 1D nanostructure.</dc:description>

         <title>Take your Positions and Shine: Effects of Positioning Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores within Sequence&#8208;Defined Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A luminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is employed for the conjugation onto supramolecular ligands in order to allow for detection of ligand binding. Supramolecular ligands are based on the combination of sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamine) scaffolds and guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (GCP) as binding motif. We hypothesize that AIE properties are strongly affected by positioning of the luminophore within the ligand scaffold. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effects placing the AIE luminophore at different positions within the overall construct, e.g. in the main or side chain of the olig(amidoamine). Indeed, we can show that the position within the ligand structure strongly affects AIE, both for the ligand itself as well as when applying the ligand for the detection of different biological and synthetic polyanions.</dc:description>

         <title>CoOx@Co&#8208;NC Catalyst with Dual Active Centers for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution: Breaking Trade&#8208;off of Particle Size and Metal Loading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the metal loading and downsizing the metal particle size are two effective ways to boost the electrochemical performance of catalysts. However, it is difficult to simultaneously increase the metal loading and reduce the particle size since isolated individual atoms are easy to aggregate into nanoparticles when increasing the metal loading. To tackle this contradiction, we report a bottom&#8208;up ligand&#8208;mediated strategy to facilely prepare ultrafine CoO  x  &#160;nanoclusters anchored on a Co&#8208;N&#8208;containing carbon matrix (CoO  x  @Co&#8208;NC). The co&#8208;exist of N and O atoms prevent Co atoms agglomerating into large particles and allowing the formation of ultrafine dispersed Co species with large Co loading (up to 20 wt.%). Since the relationship between ultrasmall size and large metal loading is well balanced, the CoO  x  nanoclusters have no inhibitory effect, but facilitate the catalytic performance of Co&#8208;N  4  sites during OER process. Consequently, due to the synergistic effect of ultrafine CoO  x  nanoclusters and Co&#8208;N  4  &#160;macrocycles, the as&#8208;synthesized CoO  x  @Co&#8208;NC exhibit promising OER activity (&#951;  10  =370 mV, Tafel plot=40 mV/dec), bettering than that of benchmark RuO  2  &#160;(&#951;  10  =411 mV, Tafel plot=72 mV/dec). This ligand&#8208;mediated strategy to synthesize carbonaceous materials containing dual active centers with large metal loading is promising for developing active and stable catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic Framework (MOF) is an ideal precursor/template for porous carbon, and its active components are uniformly doped, which can be used in energy storage and catalytic conversion fields. Metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224 with carboxylporphyrin as ligand was synthesized, and then Zn  2+  and Co  2+  ions were coordinated in the center of the porphyrin ring by post&#8208;modification. Here, PCN&#8208;224&#8208;ZnCo with different ratios of bimetallic Zn  2+  /Co  2+  ions is used as the precursor, and the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon(M&#8208;N&#8208;C) material of PCN&#8208;224&#8208;ZnCo&#8208;950 was obtained by pyrolysis the precursor at 950&#176;C in Ar. Because Zn is easy to volatilize at 950&#176;C, the formed M&#8208;N&#8208;C materials can reflect different Co contents and different basic site concentrations. The formed material still maintains the original basic framework. With the increase of  Zn  2+  /Co  2+  ratio in precursor, the concentration of N&#8208;containing alkaline sites in pyrolysis products gradually increase. Compared with the precursor, PCN&#8208;224&#8208;ZnCo  1  &#8208;950 with Zn  2+  /Co  2+  =1:1 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/ alkaline site concentration. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO  2  with epoxide. More importantly, the current method of adjusting the acidic/basic sites in M&#8208;N&#8208;C materials through volatilization of volatile metals can provide an effective strategy for adjusting the catalysis of MOF derivatives with porphyrin structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Three&#8208;coordinate Ph BOX Me2 ZnR ( Ph BOX Me2 = phenyl&#8208;(4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;oxazolinato; R = Me 2a , Et 2b ) catalyzes the dehydrocoupling of primary or secondary silanes and alcohols to give silyl ethers and hydrogen, with high turnover numbers (TON), up to 10 7 , under solvent&#8208;free conditions. Primary and secondary silanes react with small, medium, and large alcohols to give varying degrees of substitution, from mono&#8208;alkoxylation to tri&#8208;alkoxylation, while tri&#8208;substituted silanes do not react with MeOH under these conditions. The effect of coordinative unsaturation on the behavior of the Zn catalyst is revealed through a dramatic variation of both rate law and experimental rate constants, which depend on the concentrations of both the alcohol and silane reactants. That is, the catalyst adapts its mechanism access the most facile and efficient conversion. In particular, either alcohol or silane bind to the open coordination site on the Ph BOX Me2 ZnOR catalyst to form a Ph BOX Me2 ZnOR(HOR) complex under one set of conditions or an unprecedented &#963;&#8208;adduct Ph BOX Me2 ZnOR(H&#8211;SiR' 3 ) under other conditions. Saturation kinetics provide evidence for the latter species, in support of the hypothesis that &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactions, involving four&#8208;centered electrocyclic 2&#963;&#8208;2&#963; transition states, are preceded by &#963;&#8208;adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Aza&#8208;Crown Ether Complexes as Biomimetics for Lanthanide and Calcium Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the role of metal ions in biology can lead to the development of new catalysts for several industrially important transformations. Lanthanides are the most recent group of metal ions that have been shown to be important in biology i.e. &#8208; in quinone&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Here we evaluate a  literature&#8208;known  pyrroloquinoline quinone and 1&#8208;aza&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 based ligand platform as scaffold for Ca  2+  , Ba  2+  , La  3+  and Lu  3+  biomimetics of MDH and we evaluate the importance of ligand design, charge, size, counterions and base for the alcohol oxidation reaction using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we report a new straightforward synthetic route (3 steps instead of 11 and 33% instead of 0.6% yield) for biomimetic ligands based on PQQ. We show that when studying biomimetics for MDH, larger metal ions and those with lower charge in this case promote the dehydrogenation reaction more effectively and that this is likely an effect of the ligand design which must be considered when studying biomimetics. To gain more information on the structures and impact of counterions of the complexes, we performed collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments and observe that the nitrates are more tightly bound than the triflates. To resolve the structure of the complexes in the gas phase we combined DFT&#8208;calculations and ion mobility measurements (IMS). Furthermore, we characterized the obtained complexes and reaction mixtures using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and show the presence of a small amount of quinone&#8208;based radical.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Functionality with Photoswitchable Hydrazone Cytidine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of hydrazone modified cytidine phosphoramidite building block was synthesized and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides&#160;to construct photoswitchable DNA strands. The  E&#8208;Z  isomerization triggered by the irradiation of blue light with a wavelength of 450 nm was investigated and confirmed by  1  H NMR and HPLC in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotides. The light activated  Z  form isomer of this hydrazone&#8208;cytidine with a six&#8208;member intramolecular hydrogen bond was found to inhibit DNA synthesis in the primer extension model by using  Bst  DNA polymerase. In addition, the hydrazone modification caused the misincorporation of dATP together with dGTP into the growing DNA strand with similar selectivity, highlighting the potential G to A mutation. This work provides a novel functional DNA building block and an additional molecular tool that have potential chemical biology and bio&#8208;medicinal applications to control DNA synthesis and DNA&#8208;enzyme interactions using cell friendly blue light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic&#8208;like Molecules Built on a Pillar[5]arene Core as Hole Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;branched molecules have recently demonstrated interesting behaviour as charge&#8208;transporting materials within the fields of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). For this reason, extended triarylamine dendrons have been grafted onto a pillar[5]arene core to generate dendrimer&#8208;like compounds which have been used as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for PSCs. The performances of the solar cells containing these novel compounds have been extensively investigated. Interestingly, a positive dendritic effect has been evidenced as the hole transporting properties are improved when going from the first to the second&#8208;generation compound. The stability of the devices based on the best performing pillar[5]arene material has been also evaluated in a high&#8208;throughput ageing setup for 500 h at high temperature. When compared to reference devices prepared from spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, the behaviour is similar. An analysis of the economic advantages arising from the use of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based material revealed however that our pillar[5]arene&#8208;based material is cheaper than the reference.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;triggered Structural Dynamics of Non&#8208;coordinating Guest Moieties in a Fluorescent Actinide Polyrotaxane Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the synthesis of a novel fluorescent actinide polyrotaxane compound  URCP1  through the utilization of an end&#8208;cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non&#8208;coordinating guest motif in the obtained polyrotaxane, with increased freedom and structural flexibility, can display intriguing temperature&#8208;triggered conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6], which was clearly evidenced by crystallographic snapshots at different temperatures. Notably, this observation of temperature&#8208;triggered structural dynamics in  URCP1  represents the first report of actinide polyrotaxane with such dynamics in solid&#8208;state. Moreover,  URCP1  has a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 49.8%, comparable to other luminescent uranyl compounds, and can work as a fluorescent probe to selectively detect Fe  3+  over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of detection being as low as 4.4 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  ppm.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Aerobic Oxygenation of Phenols in a Visible&#8208;Light Continuous&#8208;Flow Photoreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild photocatalytic phenol oxygenation enabled by a continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor using visible light and pressurized air is described herein. Products for wide&#8208;ranging applications, including the synthesis of vitamins, were obtained in high yields by precisely controlling principal process parameters. The reactor design permits low organophotocatalyst loadings to generate singlet oxygen. It is anticipated that the efficient aerobic phenol oxygenation to benzoquinones and  p&#8208;quinols contributes to sustainable synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Applying Unconventional Spectroscopies to the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets, Co(PPh3)2X2 (X = Cl, Br, I): Unveiling Magnetic Transitions and Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large separation of magnetic levels and slow relaxation in metal complexes are desirable properties of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Spin&#8208;phonon coupling (interactions of magnetic levels with phonons) is ubiquitous, leading to magnetic relaxation and loss of memory in SMMs and quantum coherence in qubits. Direct observation&#160;of magnetic transitions and spin&#8208;phonon coupling in molecules is challenging. We have found that far&#8208;IR magnetic spectra (FIRMS) of Co(PPh3)2X2&#160;(Co&#8208;X; X = Cl, Br, I) reveal rarely observed spin&#8208;phonon coupling as avoided crossings between magnetic and&#160;u&#8208;symmetry phonon transitions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) gives phonon spectra. Calculations using VASP and Phonopy programs gave phonon symmetries and movies. Magnetic transitions among zero&#8208;field split (ZFS) levels of the&#160;S&#160;= 3/2 electronic ground state were probed by INS, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR), FIRMS, and frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR (FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR), giving magnetic excitation spectra and determining ZFS parameters&#160;(D,&#160;E) and&#160;g&#160;values.&#160;Ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) was used to analyze earlier electronic absorption spectra and give calculated ZFS parameters matching those from the experiments. DFT calculations also gave spin densities in&#160;Co&#8208;X, showing that the larger Co(II)&#160;spin density in a molecule is,&#160;the larger its ZFS magnitude is. The current work reveals&#160;dynamics of magnetic and phonons excitations in SMMs. Studies of such couplings in the future would help understand how spin&#8208;phonon coupling may lead to magnetic relaxation and develop guidance&#160;to control such coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;stiffening and Non&#8208;cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic peptides bearing terminal alkyl tails form supramolecular nanofibers that are increasingly used as biomaterials with multiple functionalities.&#160;&#160;Insertion of alkylene chains in peptides can be designed as another type of amphiphilic peptide, yet the influence of the internal alkylene chains on self&#8208;assembly and biological properties remains poorly defined.&#160;&#160;Unlike the terminal alkyl tails, the internal alkylene chains can affect not only the hydrophobicity but also the flexibility and packing of the peptides.&#160;&#160;Herein, we demonstrate the supramolecular and biological effects of the central alkylene chain length inserted in a peptide.&#160;&#160;Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthened&#160;&#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds and modulation of the packing order, and consequently the amphiphilic peptide bearing C2 alkylene chain formed a hydrogel with the highest stiffness.&#160;&#160;Interestingly, the amphiphilic peptides bearing internal alkylene chains longer than C2 showed a diminished cell&#8208;adhesive property.&#160;&#160;This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Systematic Access of Ternary Organotetrel&#8208;Copper Chalcogenide Clusters via [PhTE3]3&#8722; Anions (T = Si, Sn; E = S, Se)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fragmentation reactions of organotetrel chalcogenide heteroadamantane&#8208;type clusters [(PhT)  4  E  6  ] (T/E&#160;=&#160;Si/S (  1  ); Si/Se; Sn/S, and Sn/Se) by addition of the corresponding sodium chalcogenide yield salts of the general formula Na  3  [PhTE  3  ], with T/E = Si/S (  2  ); Si/Se (  3  ); Sn/S (  A  ); Sn/Se (  4  ). Reaction of these salts with [Cu(PPh  3  )  3  Cl] afford a series of organotetrel&#8208;copper chalcogenide clusters [(CuPPh  3  )  6  (PhTE  3  )  2  ] with T/E&#160;=&#160;Si/S; (  5  ),&#160;Si/Se (  6  ),Sn/S (  7  ) and Sn/Se (  8  ; obtained after shorter crystallization time than  7  ).  5  &#8211;  8  share a common structural motif with two intact {PhTS  3  } units coordinating a Cu  6  moiety, which was previously reported with other ligands, and for the Sn and Ge congeners only. If the Sn/Se reaction system is allowed to crystallize more slowly, single&#8208;crystals of compound [(CuPPh  3  )  6  (PhSnSe  3  )  3  Cu  3  SnSe] (  9  ) are obtained, which are based on a larger cluster structure. Hence,  9  might form from  8  through incorporation of additional cluster fragments.

         <title>Multifunctional Materials Serving as Efficient Non&#8208;Doped Violet&#8208;Blue Emitters and Host Materials for Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient   multifunctional  materials acting as  violet&#8208;blue emitters as well as host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs  are crucial but rare due to demand that they should have high first singlet state (S  1  ) energy and first triplet state (T  1  ) energy simultaneously. In this study, two  novel violet&#8208;blue bipolar fluorophores  ,  TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF  and  SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF  , were designed and synthesized by introducing the hole transporting moiety triphenylamine (TPA) and spirobifluorene (SBF) unit that has high T  1  into high deep blue emission quantum yield group phenanthroimidazole (PI). As the results, the non&#8208;doped OLEDs based on  TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF  exhibited excellent EL performance with  a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE  max  ) of 6.76%  and a violet&#8208;blue emission  with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) of (0.152, 0.059)  .  The device based on  SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF  displayed  EQE  max  of 6.19% with CIE of (0.159, 0.049)  , which nearly matches the CIE coordinates of the violet&#8208;blue emitters standard of (0.131, 0.046). These EL performances are comparable to the best reported non&#8208;doped deep or violet&#8208;blue emissive OLEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.06 in recent years.  Additionally, the green, yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs with  TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF  and  SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF  as host materials achieved a high  EQE  max  of about 20% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off at the ultra&#8208;high luminance of 10 000 cd m  &#8208;2  . These results provided a new construction strategy for designing high&#8208;performance violet&#8208;blue emitters as well as efficient host materials for  phosphorescent OLEDs  .</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Photoresponsive Alkaline Earth Metal Coordination Networks: Synthesis, Topology, Photochromism and Photoluminescence Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive materials are a key part of the smart age, which have broad applied potential. Coordination Networks (CNs) are widely used due to their designability and stability. In this work, three novel alkaline earth metal coordination networks (AEM&#8208;CNs): [Mg(CMNDI)(H  2  O)  2  ], [Ca(CMNDI)(H  2  O)  2  ]&#183;H  2  O, and [Sr(CMNDI)(H  2  O)(DMF)] with  fsl  ,  cds  , and  scn  topology nets were synthetized by N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(carboxymethyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (H  2  CMNDI), and the  scn  net is not found in the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource and ToposPro. The reusable and sensitive photochromic properties of three CNs enable them to be used as secret inks or ultraviolet detectors. In addition, the CNs also exhibited reusable photoluminescence  turn&#8208;off  toward drug molecules, balsalazide disodium (Bal.) and colchicine (Col.), with a nice limit of detection of 0.16 and 0.70 &#956;M. To our best knowledge, fluorescence sensor towards Bal. is the first time to be studied. Therefore, the AEM&#8208;CNs provided a design idea of integrated photoresponsive materials. We believe that related study would be further improved in near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Guest&#8208;induced Switchability in the Metal&#8208;organic Framework DUT&#8208;13(Zn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The switching mechanism of the flexible framework Zn  4  O(benztb)  1.5  (benztb &#8208; N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;benzidine tetrabenzoate), also known as DUT&#8208;13, was studied by advanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and gas physisorption techniques. In situ synchrotron PXRD experiments upon physisorption of nitrogen (77 K) and n&#8208;butane (273 K) shed light on the hitherto unnoticed guest&#8208;induced breathing in the mesoporous MOF. The mechanism of contraction is based on the conformationally labile benztb ligand and accompanied by the reduction of specific pore volume from 2.03 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  in open pore phase to 0.91 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  in contracted pore phase. The high temperature limit for adsorption&#8208;induced contraction of 170K, determined by systematic temperature variation of methane adsorption isotherms indicate that DUT&#8208;13 framework is softer in comparison with other mesoporous MOFs like DUT&#8208;49 and does not support the formation of overloaded metastable states, required for negative gas adsorption transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Forever Young: Structural Stability of Telomeric Guanine&#8208;Quadruplexes in Presence of Oxidative DNA Lesions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human telomeric DNA,in G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) conformation, is characterized by a remarkable structural stability that confers it the capacity to resist to oxidative stress producing one or even clustered 8&#8208;oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesions. We present a combined experimental/computational investigation, by using circular dichroism in aqueous solutions, cellular immunofluorescence assays and molecular dynamics simulations, that identifies the crucial role of the stability of G4s to oxidative lesions, related also to their biological role as inhibitors of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in most cancers associated to oxidative stress</dc:description>

         <title>Rapidly Adaptive All&#8208;covalent Nanoparticle Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging nanotechnologies demand the manipulation of nanoscale components with the same predictability and programmability as is taken for granted in molecular synthetic methodologies. Yet installing appropriately reactive chemical functionality on nanomaterial surfaces has previously entailed compromises in terms of reactivity scope, functionalization density, or both. Here, we introduce an idealized dynamic covalent nanoparticle building block for divergent and adaptive post&#8208;synthesis modification of colloidal nanomaterials. Acetal&#8208;protected monolayer&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles are prepared via operationally simple protocols and are stable to long&#8208;term storage. Tuneable surface densities of reactive aldehyde functionalities are revealed on&#8208;demand, leading to a wide range of adaptive surface engineering options from one nanoscale synthon. Analytically tractable with molecular precision, interfacial reaction kinetics and dynamic surface constitutions can be probed in situ at the ensemble level. High functionalization densities combined with rapid equilibration kinetics enable environmentally adaptive surface constitutions and rapid nanoparticle property switching in response to simple chemical effectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Energetics of competing chiral supramolecular polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality can have unexpected consequences including on properties other than spectroscopic. We show herein that a racemic mixture of bis&#8208;urea&#160; stereoisomers&#160; forms thermodynamically stable supramolecular polymers that result in a more viscous solution than for the pure &#160;stereoisomer. &#160;The origin of this macroscopic property was probed by characterizing the structure and stability of the assemblies. Both &#160; racemic and non&#8208;racemic bis&#8208;urea stereoisomers &#160; form two competing helical supramolecular polymers in solution: a double and a single helical structure at low and high temperature, respectively. The transition temperature between these assemblies, as probed by spectroscopic and calorimetric analyses, is strongly influenced by the composition (by up to 70&#176;C). A simple model that accounts for the thermodynamics of this system, indicates that the stereochemical defects (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) affect much more the stability of single helices. Therefore, the heterochiral double helical structure predominates over the single helical structure (whilst the opposite holds for the homochiral structures), which explains the aforementioned higher viscosity of the racemic bis&#8208;urea solution. This rationale constitutes a new basis to tune the macroscopic properties of the increasing number of supramolecular polymers reported to exhibit competing chiral nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nematic Triphenyltriazine Triesters and the Induction of the Columnar Mesophase by Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas their para homologs are not mesogenic, the disk&#8208;shaped triphenyltriazine meta&#8208;trialkylesters obtained via trimerization of 3&#8208;cyanobenzoic alkylester, which are configurationally more flexible, exhibit a monotropic nematic mesophase. Introduction of fluorine atoms into the alkyl chains or into the phenyl moieties leads to the appearance of an enantiotropic columnar mesophase. If fluorine is introduced both in the chains and in the phenyl moieties, only a monotropic mesophase remains. Fluorination of either the alkyl chains or the aromatic core, but not both, appears thus as a simple means of inducing or stabilizing columnar self&#8208;assembly in disk&#8208;shaped systems. As the homeotropically alignable columnar mesophase can thus be made to persist at room temperature, as energies higher than 3eV of the first excited triplet state are computed in agreement with the value reported for the parent arene, and as they are not fluorescent themselves, these compounds are of promise as aligning host matrices for blue&#8208;emitting TADF devices with improved light outcoupling. Dilution of a columnar with a nonmesogenic homolog induces the nematic state, indicating that the nanoscopic make&#8208;up of both mesophases is closely related.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whereas their para homologs are not mesogenic, the disk&#8208;shaped triphenyltriazine meta&#8208;trialkylesters obtained via trimerization of 3&#8208;cyanobenzoic alkylester, which are configurationally more flexible, exhibit a monotropic nematic mesophase. Introduction of fluorine atoms into the alkyl chains or into the phenyl moieties leads to the appearance of an enantiotropic columnar mesophase. If fluorine is introduced both in the chains and in the phenyl moieties, only a monotropic mesophase remains. Fluorination of either the alkyl chains or the aromatic core, but not both, appears thus as a simple means of inducing or stabilizing columnar self&#8208;assembly in disk&#8208;shaped systems.

         <title>Coordination Properties of Hydroxyisophthalic Acids: Topological Correlations, Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties of New Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxyisophthalic acids are valuable polytopic ligands for the design of functional materials based on coordination polymers due to the variety of charges and coordination modes they possess. Here we describe synthesis, thermal stability, non&#8208;linear optical and spectroscopic properties of five novel coordination compounds [K  2  L(H  2  O)  2  ], [MgL(H  2  O)  2  ]&#183;3H  2  O, [CaL(H  2  O)  3  ], [SrL(H  2  O)  3  ]&#183;H  2  O, [BaL(H  2  O)(H  2  O)  5  ] and one salt (NH  4  )  2  L&#183;2H  2  O with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalic acid (  H  2  L  ), which has not been tested in the assembling crystalline coordination networks before.&#160; Peculiarities of the structural organization of the compounds were analyzed and compared with those for other hydroxyisophthalates. The coordination properties of hydroxyisophthalic acids were studied from the topological point of view. The comparative topological analysis of coordination and H&#8208;bonded networks was performed. Structural correlations revealed in this study can be useful for the design of hydroxyisophthalate&#8208;based coordination networks including porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks, proton conductors, and NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fischer Carbene Complexes: A Glance at Two Decades of Research on Higher&#8208;order Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) is electron deficient. If bearing an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated system, it can generate a wide variety of compounds by undergoing many different transformations, including higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. The latter are described as pericyclic reactions in which more than six electrons participate. These reactions have been employed in various areas of organic synthesis, resulting in highly selective compounds with a broad range of scaffolds. The first studies on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs frequently yielded competing by&#8208;products. Many groups have attempted to increase selectivity by exploring distinct reaction conditions, reagents and co&#8208;catalysts (e.g., metal&#8208;mediated cycloadditions). The present review is the first to focus exclusively on using higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs to synthesize carbocycles and heterocycles. Based on two decades of reports, an analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and the structural diversity obtained by the substituent effect.</dc:description>

The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density as well as the corresponding electronic inner&#8208;crystal forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provide the detailed examination of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A detailed analysis of a complete set of the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density is carried out for noncovalent interactions in the crystal of a uracil derivative using experimental X&#8208;ray charge density. The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.&#8201;g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.

         <title>Reactions of C60 with Pyridazine and Phthalazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzoannulation of pyridazine changes its electronic structure drastically, thus rendering the pericyclic reaction with C60 efficient. Theoretical calculations suggested that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. Therefore, the enhanced reactivity could be explained by the better interaction between the LUMO of C60 and the HOMO of phthalazine.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;opened bisfulleroids are one of suitable building blocks for making a large hole on fullerenes. This work focuses on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of C60 with azines, among synthetic methods developed thus far, to provide bisfulleroids. Surprisingly, the computational study predicted that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. The benzoannulation to the pyridazine ring, i.&#8201;e., phthalazine, resulted in the remarkably shortened reaction time due to the better interaction between the HOMO of phthalazine and the LUMO of C60 as well as stronger 2,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene character in the phthalazine as confirmed crystallographically. Contrary to expectations, the benzobisfulleroid was converted into corresponding orifice&#8208;enlarged derivative via the photooxygenation slightly faster than the fulleroid derived from pyridazine.

Surprisingly, the computational study predicted that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. The benzoannulation to the pyridazine ring, i.&#8201;e., phthalazine, resulted in the remarkably shortened reaction time due to the better interaction between the HOMO of phthalazine and the LUMO of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; as well as stronger 2,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene character in the phthalazine as confirmed crystallographically. Contrary to expectations, the benzobisfulleroid was converted into corresponding orifice&#8208;enlarged derivative via the photooxygenation slightly faster than the fulleroid derived from pyridazine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Nucleation of Low&#8208;Density Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;density polymorphs obtained in a high&#8208;pressure environment are reported in this work. The single crystals were grown by the kinetic crystallization of the seeds precipitated in high&#8208;entropy conditions, owing to the extreme temperature and pressure in the confined space. This simple and inexpensive method opens a colorful palette of polymorphic forms inaccessible with traditional methods. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005121).

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The puzzling two&#8208;peaked X&#8208;ray absorption structure at the Ce L3 edge provides a wealth of information about the electronic structure of Ce complexes, such as the Ce 4f occupation and oxidation state and the extent of metal&#8208;ligand covalency. Multiconfigurational wavefunction calculations of the Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2, reveal the identity of the two&#8208;peaked edge structures and connection with the configurational admixture of the spectroscopically probed electronic states.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral YbIII&#8208;Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>

         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active chiral near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescent field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet of YbIII at the solid&#8208;state was designed from the bridging of two Yb(facam)3 units with the bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad.







Abstract
A field&#8208;induced chiral YbIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) displayed an unprecedented near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) in the solid&#8208;state. The bridging bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad (L) allowed an efficient sensitization of the NIR 2F5/2&#8594;2F7/2 emission while the NIR&#8208;CPL is associated to the f&#8208;f transitions of the YbIII ion bearing chiral &#946;&#8208;diketonate derived&#8208;camphorate ancillary ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by introducing heptanol molecules during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The array of vertically aligned Au NRs as SERS substrates can achieve the ultralow limit of detection (LOD) (10&#8722;16&#8197;M for CV probes) with good reliability and reproducibility. Thanks to their LOD, they can be used for rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances with an ultralow concentration.







Abstract
In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The results show that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules not only alter the micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8722;NP seeds in addition to enhancing the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis of Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8722;Au120&#215;90 NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10&#8722;16&#8197;M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.

         <title>Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2'2'&#8208;Difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;Form Duplexes</title>

         <dc:description>
2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).







Abstract
We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2'F&#8901;&#8901;H8 attractive interaction with a neighboring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions. These interactions share some features with pseudohydrogen bonds described previously in other nucleic acids structures with fluorine modified sugars.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Alkenes via Regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;Selective Addition of Silylboronates to Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.







Abstract
As a new and complementary method for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes, a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions, and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.

         <title>Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation conversion based on a cobalt electrocatalyst was employed to accelerate hydrogen evolution in water. The Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays modified nickel foam anode provided rich active sites for the transformation of tetrahydroisoquinolines into various value&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines. Electro&#8208;activated higher&#8208;valent cobalt and plenty of surface oxygen species were responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
Coupling the H2 evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O2 in the anodic reaction. Herein, Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays in&#8197;situ grown on nickel foam (Co3O4@NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co3O4@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co3O4@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Chiroptical Properties of Indolo&#8208; and Pyridopyrrolo&#8208;Carbazole&#8208;Based C2&#8208;Symmetric Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azahelicenes bearing an indolocarbazole backbone were prepared by a step&#8208;economic double dehydrogenative cyclization under palladium catalysis. Their optical resolutions were attained by chiral HPLC. The pyridopyrrolo derivative (X=N, R=H) was found to show ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors than those of the parent azahelicene (X=CH, R=H) in both CD and CPL measurements. The CPL color could be switched by addition of an acid or introduction of a donor substituent R.







Abstract
Treatment of 11,12&#8208;bis(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl or 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole with an oxidizing system of Pd(II)/Ag(I) induced effective double dehydrogenative cyclization to afford the corresponding &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicenes. The optical resolutions were readily achieved by a preparative chiral HPLC. It was found that the pyridopyrrolo&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based azahelicene that contains four nitrogen atoms exhibits ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors both in circularly dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), |gCD| and |gCPL| values being 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2 and 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively, as compared with the parent indolocarbazole&#8208;based azahelicene. Theoretical calculations at the RI&#8208;CC2 level were employed to rationalize the observed enhanced chiroptical responses. The (chir)optical properties of the former helicene was further tuned by a protonation leading to remarkable red&#8208;shift with a considerable enhancement of the |gCPL| value.

         <title>Iridoid Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis in Aphids Mimics Iridoid&#8208;Producing Plants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural product biosynthesis in animals: Chemical synthesis of isotopically&#8208;labelled molecular probes and topical application using female pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, are deployed along with coupled GC&#8208;mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) to show that biosynthesis of the female&#8208;produced aphid sex pheromone components (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) may follow a broadly similar route to that characterized for plants.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) in plants involves iridoid synthase (ISY), an atypical reductive cyclase that catalyses the reduction of 8&#8208;oxogeranial into the reactive enol of (S)&#8208;8&#8208;oxocitronellal, and cyclization of this enol intermediate, either non&#8208;enzymatically or by a nepetalactol&#8208;related short chain dehydrogenase enzyme (NEPS) that yields the nepetalactols. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis in&#8197;vivo of 1 and 2 in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a library of isotopically&#8208;labelled monoterpenoids as molecular probes. Topical application of deuterium&#8208;labelled probes synthesized from geraniol and nerol resulted in production of 2H4&#8722;lactol 1 and 2H4&#8722;lactone 2. However, deuterium incorporation was not evident using labelled probes synthesized from (S)&#8208;citronellol. These results suggest that iridoid biosynthesis in animals, specifically aphids, may follow a broadly similar route to that characterised for plants.

         <title>Reactions on a 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Moiety of a Fullerene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety embedded in a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative was examined to produce &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl, and acid anhydride compounds. The former two showed a significantly supressed encapsulation/escape dynamics of a water molecule as well as electrochemical properties largely different from the last one.







Abstract
A 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety on a cage&#8208;opened fullerene skeleton is one of suitable building blocks for the further derivatization. Herein, we discuss the chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compound into &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, acid anhydride, and &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives. Despite possessing a sterically small methylene unit in the last one, the release of an encapsulated water molecule was significantly supressed whereas the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide bearing three bulky p&#8208;tolyl groups on the P&#8208;atom enabled the faster insertion/release dynamics, implying the flexibility of the phosphonium substituent. The replacement of the carbonyl group with phosphorus ylide and methylene units largely varied electrochemical properties of the fullerene skeleton, likely arising from the anionic charge delocalized over the entire molecule and removal of an electron&#8208;withdrawable carbonyl group, respectively.

Multicomponent dynagels for heparin encapsulation: Dynamic covalently cross&#8208;linked dynamers with high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and self&#8208;healing behaviors have been used for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Double cross&#8208;linked dynamic hydrogels, dynagels, have been prepared through reversible imine bonds and supramolecular interactions, which showed good pH responsiveness, injectability, self&#8208;healing property and biocompatibility. With the further encapsulation of heparin, the obtained hydrogels exhibited good anti&#8208;bacterial activity and promotion effects for 3D cell culture.

In 1963 and early 1964, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B12. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of 1H&#8197;NMR parameters.







Abstract
In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B12, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the 1H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.

         <title>Synthesis of Desepoxy&#8208;Tedanolide C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of one isomer of the marine natural product tedanolide C was accomplished and provides evidence about the relative configuration of this member of the tedanolide family. The synthesis takes advantage of a variant of the Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. The synthesis was particularly sensitive to the appropriate selection of protecting groups, which made constant protecting group switches necessary. The spectroscopic data of the synthesized isomer support a different configuration than the originally proposed one.







Abstract
The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C was accomplished and provided experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination were used to assemble the carbon framework.

         <title>Rhamnogalacturonan II: Chemical Synthesis of a Substructure Including &#945;&#8208;2,3&#8208;Linked Kdo**
</title>

Chemical synthesis of a Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide was achieved by a [4+1] post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone, through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.

New visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable solvatochromic fluorescent label for light&#8208;up and colour&#8208;change sensing of DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine and its 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate bearing solvatochromic acetophenyl&#8208;thienyl&#8208;aniline fluorophore was developed using the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key step. The triphosphate was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA. The labelled nucleotide or DNA exerted weak red fluorescence when excited at 405&#8197;nm, but a significant colour change (to yellow or green) and light&#8208;up (up to 20 times) was observed when the DNA probes interacted with proteins or lipids.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free &#945; Csp3&#8722;H Cyanation of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash chromatography column free and transition metal free cyanation of &#945; C&#8722;H sulfonylamide was developed to access valuable &#945;&#8208;amino cyanation products from a variety of fluorine masked sulfonylamides. Compared with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and occurs under mild conditions. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron allows for excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8722;F sulfonylamides, which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines, are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction is also characterized by broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free workup. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron pathway to generate imines through manipulation of the leaving group allows us to achieve excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>

Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes: Highly efficient photoluminescence was achieved in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum using strong s&#8208;donating cyclometalated NHC ligands and a dianionic (N&#8201;N)&#8208;type bidentate as the ancillary ligand. Detailed photophysical investigations supported by density functional theory calculations provide insights into the excited&#8208;state properties of this new class of emitter molecules. The realization of the first solution&#8208;processable OLED device based on these strongly luminescent gold(III) carbene emitter systems opens up exciting new opportunities in light emitting applications.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>

         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.
