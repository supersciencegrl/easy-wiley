         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Nanomaterials for Activatable Photodiagnosis and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) spans wavelengths between 1,000 to 1,700 nanometers, featuring deep tissue penetration and reduced tissue scattering and absorption characteristics, providing robust support for cancer treatment and tumor imaging research. This review explores the utilization of activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy based on tumor microenvironments (e.g., reactive oxygen species, pH, glutathione, hypoxia) and external stimuli (e.g., laser, ultrasound, photothermal) for precise tumor treatment and imaging. Special emphasis is placed on the advancements and advantages of activatable NIR&#8208;II nanomedicines in novel therapeutic modalities like photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and photoacoustic imaging. This encompasses achieving deep tumor penetration, real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process, and obtaining high&#8208;resolution, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio images even at low material concentrations. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, the challenges faced by activatable NIR&#8208;II phototherapy are discussed, alongside potential strategies to overcome these hurdles.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of crystalline materials that can respond to mechanical stress by dissipating internal strain in a number of ways. Given the serendipitous nature of the discovery of such crystals, progress in the field requires advances in computational methods for the accurate and high&#8208;throughput computation of the nanomechanical properties of crystals on specific facets which are exposed to mechanical stress. Here, we develop and apply a new atomistic model for computing the surface elastic moduli of crystals on any set of facets of interest using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT&#8208;D) methods. The model was benchmarked against a total of 24 reported nanoindentation measurements from a diverse set of molecular crystals and was found to be generally reliable. Using only the experimental crystal structure of the dietary supplement, L&#8208;Aspartic acid, the model was subsequently applied under blind test conditions, to correctly predict the growth morphology, facet and nanomechanical properties of L&#8208;Aspartic acid to within the accuracy of the measured elastic stiffness of the crystal, 24.53 &#177; 0.56 GPa. This work paves the way for the computational design and experimental realization of other functional molecular crystals with tailor&#8208;made mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Induced Structural Transition and Lipase Immobilizatoin in Mesoporous Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The disorder to order and structural transformation are unique metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) characters. How to adapt or control both behaviors in MOF is rarely studied. In this case, we demonstrate that our successful synthesis of [Al(OH)(PDA)]n (AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H, and AlPDA&#8208;68) with H2PDA = 4,4'&#8208;[1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(ethyne&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl)]&#8208;di benzoic acid has illuminated the intricate world of Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Al&#8208;MOFs), offering profound insights into defect structures to order and transformations. AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, in particular, revealed a fascinating interplay of various pore sizes within both micro and mesoporous regions, unveiling a unique lattice rearrangement phenomenon upon solvent desorption. Defects and disorders emerged as key orchestrators of transforming AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, with its initially imperfect crystallinity, into the highly crystalline, hierarchically porous AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation, Selective Encapsulation, and Tautomerization Control of Isoindoleone Utilizing Guanidinium Sulfonate Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the use of tetrakis(guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR) and bis(guanidinium) 1,5&#8208;napthalene disulfonate (G2NDS) to catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanobenzamide (1) to isoindolone (2). Moreover, we demonstrate the remarkable selectivity of these guanidinium organosulfonate hosts in encapsulating 2 over 1. By thoroughly investigating the intramolecular cyclization reaction, we determined that guanidinium and the organosulfonate moiety acts as the catalyst in this process. Additionally, 2 is selectively encapsulated, even in mixtures of other structurally similar heterocycles like indole. Furthermore, the tautomeric state of 2 (amino isoindolone (2&#8208;A) and imino isoindolinone forms (2&#8208;I)) can be controlled by utilizing different guanidinium organosulfonate frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Crystalline Iodinated Eumelanin Monomer</title>

         <dc:description>
Functionalization of eumelanin monomer by halogenation leading to triplet state population via intersystem crossing (ISC), along with the observance of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the crystalline iodinated eumelanin monomer.







Abstract
We report the room temperature phosphorescence upon iodination on a crystalline eumelanin monomer with shielded hydroxyl moieties, ethyl 5,6&#8208;dimethoxyindole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (DMICE). Ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) is observed in the iodinated (IDMICE) as well as brominated (BDMICE) analogues of the eumelanin monomer derivative in solution. The triplet quantum yields (&#966;T) and intersystem crossing rates (kISC) of the halogenated eumelanin derivatives are 
=25.4&#177;1.1&#8201;%; 
=1.95&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 
=59.1&#177;1.6&#8201;%; 
1.36&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, as monitored using transient absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations based on nuclear ensemble method reveal that computed kISC and spin&#8208;orbit coupling matrix elements for eumelanin derivatives are larger for IDMICE relative to BDMICE. The halogen and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with distinct excitonic coupling and higher ISC rate promote phosphorescence in IDMICE molecular crystals. Accessing triplet excited states and resultant photoluminescence through structural modification of eumelanin scaffolds paves way for exploring the versatility of eumelanin&#8208;inspired molecules as bio&#8208;functional materials.

         <title>Achieving Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes via Molecule Anchoring and lon&#8208;Transport pumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valine was introduced as an aqueous electrolyte additive. The functional groups within the additive molecules were utilized to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI), thereby achieving a reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode.







Abstract
The potential for scale&#8208;up application has been acknowledged by researchers for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Nonetheless, the progress of the development is significantly impeded due to the instability of the interface between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Herein, efficient and environmentally benign valine (Val) were introduced as aqueous electrolyte additive to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) via functional groups in additive molecules, thus achieving reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. The amino groups present in Val molecules have a strong ability to adsorb on the surface of zinc metal, enabling the construction of anchored molecular layer on the surface of zinc anodes. The strongly polar carboxyl groups in Val molecules can act as ion&#8208;transport pumps to capture zinc ions in the electric double layer (EDL) through coordination chemistry. Therefore, this reconstructed EEI could modulate the zinc ion flux and simultaneously suppress side reactions and dendritic growth of Zn. Consequently, a long stable cycling up to 1400&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. Additionally, Zn//V2O5 full cell with Val additive exhibit enhanced cyclability, retaining 77&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles, displaying significant potential in promoting the commercialization of ZIBs.

     alt="Achieving Dendrite-Free Zinc Metal Anodes via Molecule Anchoring and lon-Transport pumping"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valine was introduced as an aqueous electrolyte additive. The functional groups within the additive molecules were utilized to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI), thereby achieving a reversible dendrite-free zinc anode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for scale-up application has been acknowledged by researchers for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). Nonetheless, the progress of the development is significantly impeded due to the instability of the interface between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Herein, efficient and environmentally benign valine (Val) were introduced as aqueous electrolyte additive to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) via functional groups in additive molecules, thus achieving reversible dendrite-free zinc anode. The amino groups present in Val molecules have a strong ability to adsorb on the surface of zinc metal, enabling the construction of anchored molecular layer on the surface of zinc anodes. The strongly polar carboxyl groups in Val molecules can act as ion-transport pumps to capture zinc ions in the electric double layer (EDL) through coordination chemistry. Therefore, this reconstructed EEI could modulate the zinc ion flux and simultaneously suppress side reactions and dendritic growth of Zn. Consequently, a long stable cycling up to 1400&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. Additionally, Zn//V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full cell with Val additive exhibit enhanced cyclability, retaining 77&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles, displaying significant potential in promoting the commercialization of ZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Structural, Optical and Magnetic Modifications in Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensibility of lanthanide coordination complexes to the crystal field strength makes them ideal candidates for switching Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behavior and piezochromic effect under applied high pressure. A complementary structure&#8208;property relationship is established with the combination of high pressure magnetometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction allowing to explain the observed structural, optical and magnetic modifications.







Abstract
Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets are fascinating objects that break magnetic performance records with observable magnetic bistability at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen, paving the way for potential applications in high&#8208;density data storage. The switching of lanthanide SMM has been successfully achieved using several external stimuli such as redox reaction, pH titration, light irradiation or solvation/desolvation thanks to the high sensitivity of the magnetic anisotropy to any structural change in the lanthanide surrounding. Nevertheless, the use of applied high pressure as an external stimulus is largely underused, especially considering that it can be combined with high pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction to establish a complementary structure&#8208;property relationship. This Concept article summarizes the few relevant examples of investigations of lanthanide SMMs under applied high pressure, provides conclusions on the effect of such stimulus on molecular structures and magnetic anisotropy, and finally draws perspective on the future development of magnetic measurements under applied pressure.

         <title>Predisposition in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Assembly of Tetrahedral Boronate Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Latent intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the building blocks play a crucial role in the assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs) via Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). These intramolecular interactions emerge from induced conformational restrictions during cage assembly, ultimately dictating the reaction outcome in a relay&#8208;like fashion.







Abstract
Directional bonding strategies guide the design of complex molecular architectures, yet challenges arise due to emergent behavior. Rigid structures face geometric constraints and sensitivity to mismatches, hindering the efficient assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs). Harnessing intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions offers a promising solution, broadening geometrical possibilities and enhancing adaptability to boost assembly yields. However, identifying these interactions remains challenging, with their full potential sometimes latent until final assembly. This study explores these challenges by synthesizing boronic acid tripods with varied oxygen positions at the tripodal feet and investigating their role in assembling tetrahedral boronate MOCs. Our results reveal substantial differences in the assembly efficiency among tripods. While the building blocks with oxygen in the benzylic position relative to the central aromatic ring form the MOCs in high yields, those with the oxygen atom directly bound to the central aromatic ring, only yield traces. Through X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analyses, we elucidate how intramolecular interactions profoundly influence the geometry of the building blocks and cages in a relay&#8208;like fashion, highlighting the importance of considering intramolecular interactions in the rational design of (supra)molecular architectures.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidation of Polycyclic Aromatic Amines Towards Carbazoles and Phenazine&#8208;based Aza&#8208;helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical study revealed that high activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region of the free radical hybrid determine the regioselectivity of polycyclic aromatic amines (PAAs) electrochemical oxidation towards carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicenes. This work would pave the way for precise construction of heteroatom fused helical large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using direct splicing strategy from PAHs derivatives.







Abstract
Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;&#8208;conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary&#8208;, ternary&#8208;, and quaternary&#8208;fused PAAs as electro&#8208;oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K&#8208;region, Bay&#8208;region, and L&#8208;region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron&#8208;deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro&#8208;oxidative reaction of PAA.

         <title>Silver(i) Perfluoroalcoholates: Synthesis, Structure, and their Use as Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a general access to silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates, their structure in the solid state and in solution, and their use as transfer reagents. The silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates are prepared by the reaction of AgF with the corresponding perfluorinated carbonyl compounds in acetonitrile and are stable for a prolonged time at &#8211;18 &#176;C. X&#8208;Ray analysis of single crystals of perfluoroalcoholate species showed that two Ag(i) centers are bridged by the alcoholate ligands. In acetonitrile solution, Ag[OCF3] forms different structures as indicated by IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates can be used as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reagents for the synthesis of Cu[OCF3], Cu[OC2F5], [PPh4][Au(CF3)3(OCF3)], and fluorinated alkyl ethers.</dc:description>

         <title>Unidentical Twins: Geometrically Similar but Chemically Distinct Metal&#8208;free Sites in Boron Oxide for Methane Oxidation to HCHO, CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free boron&#8208;based catalysts such as boron oxide (B2O3) and boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are promising catalysts for the methane oxidation to HCHO and CO. The B2O3 catalyst contains various probable boron sites (B1 to B6), which may be responsible for methane oxidation. In this work, we utilized density functional theory to compare two relevant geometrically identical boron sites (B2 and B4) for their reactivities. The two sites are explored in&#8208;detail for the conversion of methane to formaldehyde (M2F), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The B4 site activates the methane C&#8722;H bond easily as compared to the B2 site. In M2F conversion, the rate&#8208;determining step for the B2 site is the co&#8208;activation of dioxygen and methane, whereas over the B4 site, formaldehyde formation is the rate&#8208;determining step. The computationally&#8208;determined RDS for the B4 site coincides well with the reported experiments. It is further revealed that this site also prefers the formation of CO over CO2, which is in&#8208;line with the experiments in literature. It is also shown through orbital analysis that methanol formation does not occur during methane oxidation. We employed descriptors such as condensed Fukui functions and global electrophilicity index to chemically distinct these twin sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Polydentate Amidinato&#8208;Silylenes, &#8208;Germylenes and &#8208;Stannylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review article focuses on amidinatotetrylenes that potentially can (or have already shown to) behave as bi&#8208; or tridentate ligands because they contain at least one amidinatotetrylene moiety (silylene, germylene or stannylene) and one (or more) additional coordinable fragment(s). Currently, they are being widely used as ligands in coordination chemistry, small molecule activation and catalysis. This review classifies those that have been isolated as transition metal&#8208;free compounds into five families that differ in the position(s) of the donor group(s) (D) on the amidinatotetrylene moiety, namely: ED{R1NC(R2)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)NR1}, EX{R1NC(D)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)ND} and E{R1NC(R2)ND}2 (E = Si, Ge or Sn). Those that do not exist as transition metal&#8208;free compounds but have been observed as ligands in transition metal complexes are cyclometallated and ring&#8208;opened amidinatotetrylene ligands. This article presents schematic descriptions of their structures, the approaches used for their syntheses and a quick overview of their involvement (as ligands) in transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions. The literature is covered up to the end of 2023.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework PCN&#8208;224 Combined Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticles for Hypoxia Relief and Synergistic Photodynamic / Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are promising tumor treatments mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have the advantages of being minimally invasive. However, the hypoxia of tumor microenvironment and poor target ability often reduce the therapeutic effect. Here we propose a tumor targeted nanoplatform PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA for enhanced PDT and synergistic CDT, constructed by hyaluronate&#8208;modified Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224. Co3O4 can catalyze the decomposition of highly expressed H2O2 in tumor cells to produce oxygen and alleviate the problem of hypoxia. It can also produce hydroxyl radicals according to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction for chemical dynamic therapy, significantly improving the therapeutic effect. The cell survival experiment showed that after in vitro treatment, 4T1 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells died in a large area under the anaerobic state, while the survival ability of normal cell LO2 was nearly unchanged. This result effectively indicated that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA could effectively relieve tumor hypoxia and improve the effect of PDT and synergistic CDT. Cell uptake experiments showed that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA had good targeting properties and could effectively aggregate in tumor cells. In vivo experiments on mice, PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA presented reliable biosafety performance, and can cooperate with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.</dc:description>

         <title>External Electric Field Control of Exciton Motion in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins are excellent light&#8208;harvesting complexes. Presently they are unsuitable for photovoltaic applications, as their excellent light absorbance is compensated to a large extent by their poor transport properties, where most excitons are lost by recombination. Arranging porphyrins in regular, strongly bound, lattices of surface&#8208;anchored metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PP&#8208;SURMOFs) may facilitate charge carrier dissociation, but does not significantly enhance the conductive properties. In most cases, photogenerated excitons traverse undirected, Brownian motion through a hopping process, resulting in a substantial diffusion length to reach electrodes, leading to significant exciton loss through recombination. Here, we propose to guide exciton diffusion indirectly by an external electric field. We show that electric fields, even as strong as 1 V&#8729;nm&#8208;1, do not affect the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of the porphyrins. However, fields of 0.1 V&#8729;nm&#8729;1 and even less demonstrate a notable Stark effect, with slight band gap reductions, for some PP&#8208;SURMOFs. When applied as an electric field gradient, for instance, via the substrate, it creates a unidirectional hopping pathway for the excitons. Consequently, we expect a significant reduction of exciton diffusion length leading to increased utilization of photogenerated excitons as they reach the electrodes. This strategy holds promise for integrating photoactive molecules in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe our attempts to access a compound with an Al=P double bond by reaction of Al(Nacnac) towards [H2CN(Dipp)]2PPCO (Nacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Our observations are consistent with the formation of a transient phosphanyl&#8208;phosphaalumene at low temperatures (&#8722;70 &#176;C), however this species was found to readily undergo intramolecular C&#8211;H activation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand upon warming to room temperature. The reactivity of the transient complex toward small molecules including dihydrogen, carbon dioxide, phosphaketenes, amines and silanes could be explored at low temperatures, showcasing that the target compound can react as both a frustrated Lewis pair (via the pendant phosphanyl moiety) or in hydroelementation reactions of the Al=P bond. The elusive target molecule could be trapped by addition of a Lewis base (tetrahydrofuran) affording an isolable molecular species that reacts in an analogous fashion to the base&#8208;free compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Disulfide&#8208;Rich Starfish Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: A relaxin&#8208;like gonad&#8208;stimulating peptide (RGP), Aso&#8208;RGP, featuring six cysteine residues, was identified in the Crown&#8208;of&#8208;Thorns Starfish (COTS, Acanthaster cf.&#160;solaris) and initially produced through recombinant yeast expression. This method yielded a single&#8208;chain peptide with an uncleaved C&#8208;peptide (His Tag) and suboptimal purity. Our objective was to chemically synthesize Aso&#8208;RGP in its mature form, comprising two chains (A and B) and three disulfide bridges, omitting the C&#8208;peptide. Furthermore, we aimed to synthesize a newly identified relaxin&#8208;like peptide, Aso&#8208;RLP2, from COTS, which had not been previously synthesized. This paper report the first total chemical synthesis of Aso&#8208;RGP and Aso&#8208;RLP2. Aso&#8208;RGP synthesis proceeded without major issues, whereas the A&#8208;chain of Aso&#8208;RLP2, in its reduced and unfolded state with two free thiols, presented considerable challenges. These were initially marked by "messy" RP&#8208;HPLC profiles, typically indicative of synthesis failure. Surprisingly, oxidizing the A&#8208;chain significantly improved the RP&#8208;HPLC profile, revealing the main issue was not synthesis failure but the peptide's aggregation tendency, which initially obscured analysis. This discovery highlights the critical need to account for aggregation in peptide synthesis and analysis. Ultimately, our efforts led to the successful synthesis of both peptides with purities exceeding 95%.</dc:description>

Ultimately, our efforts led to the successful synthesis of both peptides with purities exceeding 95%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into the MOtBu (M = Na, K)&#8208;mediated dehydrogenation of dimethylamine&#8208;borane and transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective synthesis of primary amines from nitriles is challenging in synthetic chemistry due to the possible en&#8208;route generation of various amines and imines. &#160;Herein, we report a practical and operationally simple MOtBu&#8208;mediated (M = Na, K) transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding primary amines with a relatively unexplored sacrificial hydrogen source (dimethylamine borane). The strategy encompasses a broad substrate scope under transition metal&#8208;free conditions and does not require any solvent. The mechanistic investigation was performed with the aid of control experiments and spectroscopic studies. The GC analysis of the reaction mixture exhibited the evolution of the H2 gas. Additionally, detailed computational calculations were undertaken to shed light on the possible intermediates and transition states involved during the present protocol.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a comparison of the interaction modes of various chalcogen&#8208;bond donors, 2&#8208;chalcogeno&#8208;imidazolium salts have been designed, synthesized, and studied by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution NMR and DFT as well as for their ability to act as activators in an SN1&#8208;type substitution reaction. Their interaction modes in solution were elucidated based on NMR diffusion and chemical shift perturbation experiments, which were supported by DFT&#8208;calculations. Our finding is that going from lighter to the heavier chalcogens, hydrogen bonding plays a less, while chalcogen bonding an increasingly important role for the coordination of anions. Anion&#8208;&#960; interactions also show importance, especially for the sulfur and selenium derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Defects and Charges on the Colloidal Stabilization of Graphene in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphite intercalation compounds allow gentle exfoliation of soluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. Oxidation of graphenide to graphene and solvent exchange produce aqueous graphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), stabilized by electrostatic forces, with a minimal amount of defects if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposure to water.







Abstract
Mastering graphene preparation is an essential step to its integration into practical applications. For large&#8208;scale purposes, full graphite exfoliation appears as a suitable route for graphene production. However, it requires overpowering attractive van der Waals forces demanding large energy input, with the risk of introducing defects in the material. This difficulty can be overcome by using graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) as starting material. The greater inter&#8208;sheet separation in GICs (compared with graphite) allows the gentler exfoliation of soluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. A solvent exchange strategy, accompanied by the oxidation of graphenide to graphene, can be implemented to produce stable aqueous graphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), which can be readily incorporated into many processes or materials. In this work, we prove that electrostatic forces are responsible for the stability of fully exfoliated graphene in water, and explore the influence of the oxidation and solvent exchange procedures on the quality and stability of EdG. We show that the amount of defects in graphene is limited if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposing the material to water, and that gas removal of water before the incorporation of pre&#8208;oxidized graphene is advantageous for the long&#8208;term stability of EdG.

Polymerized TADF small molecules capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing are believed to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. And their recent progress is highlighted so as to shed light on the development of efficient TADF polymers.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers show a great potential in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area and flexible full&#8208;color flat&#8208;panel displays. One of the most promising design rules is based on TADF+Linker, where a small molecular TADF unit is bonded to each other by a simple linker. Unlike the expensive vacuum deposition for small molecules, these polymerized TADF small molecules (Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs) are capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing. Meanwhile, the good luminescent property of small molecular TADF emitters can be well inherited by Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs so as to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. Herein, we will highlight the recent progress of Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs, together with emphasis on their molecular design, photophysical and electroluminescence properties.

Condensation polymerization is utilized to prepare PDMS&#8208;based polythiamine ester (PTUBAF) coatings that consist of PDMS, polytetrahydrofuran (PTMG), 2, 3, 5, 6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1, 4&#8208;benzenedimethanol (TBD) as the main chains and isobornyl acrylate(IBA) as the antifouling group. The strong synergistic effect of bactericidal groups and low surface energy surface endows the PTUBAF coating with outstanding antifouling and excellent anti&#8208;corrosion performance.







Abstract
Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is widely used in marine antifouling coatings due to its low surface energy property. However, certain drawbacks of PDMS coatings such as poor surface adhesion, weak mechanical properties, and inadequate static antifouling performance have hindered its practical applications. Herein, condensation polymerization is utilized to prepare PDMS&#8208;based polythiamine ester (PTUBAF) coatings that consist of PDMS, polytetrahydrofuran (PTMG), 2, 3, 5, 6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1, 4&#8208;benzenedimethanol (TBD) as the main chains and isobornyl acrylate(IBA) as the antifouling group. The surface adhesion to the substrate is enhanced due to the hydrogen bond between the coated carbamate group and the hydroxyl group on the surface of the substrate. Mechanical properties of PTUBAF are significantly improved due to the benzene ring and six&#8208;membered ring biphase hard structure. The strong synergistic effect of bactericidal groups and low surface energy surface endows the PTUBAF coating with outstanding antifouling performance. Due to the low surface energy surface, the PTUBAF coatings are also found to possess excellent anti&#8208;corrosion. Furthermore, since the PTUBAF coatings exhibit a visible light transmittance of 91&#8201;%, they can applied as protective films for smartphones. The proposed method has the potential to boost the production and practical applications of silicone&#8208;based coatings.

Neutral pincer bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(amino)pyridine (&#8220;PN3P&#8221;) ligands appear to play a central role in the electrocatalytic abilities of the Zn(II) complexes [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=Me, 1; R=H, 2). The complexes electrocatalytically reduce CO2 at &#8208;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions and generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions with Faradaic efficiencies up to 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Air and water&#8208;stable zinc (II) complexes of neutral pincer bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(amino)pyridine (&#8220;PN3P&#8221;) ligands are reported. These compounds, [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3))Br2] (R=Me, 1; R=H, 2), were shown to be capable of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions. These complexes also electrocatalytically generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions, at the same potential, with Faradaic efficiencies of up to 90&#8201;%. DFT computations support a proposed mechanism involving the first reduction of 1 or 2 occurring at the PN3P ligand. Furthermore, computational analysis suggested a mechanism involving metal&#8208;ligand cooperation of a Lewis acidic Zn(II) and a basic ligand.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT study of Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation of ketones with diazo compounds revealed a new coordination mode of substrates which was rationalized by the trans influence. The origin of stereo&#8208;selectivity was explored based on the coordination mode. A promising new strategy to adjust stereo&#8208;selectivity by trans influence was proposed.







Abstract
Asymmetric one&#8208;carbon homologation or ring expansion of ketones with formal insertion of carbene intermediate, is a challenging but useful strategy to construct a complex skeleton. Sc(III) and chiral ligands have been employed in this regard. However, due to flexible conformations and a variety of stereo models, the origin of stereochemistry remains ambiguous. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the interactions that control the stereoselectivity of a Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation. The trans influence of counterions was found to affect the coordination mode of ketone to Sc(III), and consequently affect the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Accessing Rare &#945;&#8208;Heterocyclic Aziridines via Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;catalyzed Michael Addition/Annulation: Scope, Limitations, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of rare 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. Our approach utilizes an inherent degradation of 1,2&#8208;chloroamines in the presence of trace acid, followed by annulation to give a diverse array of cis&#8208;aziridines which are not captured by alternative synthetic methodologies. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic insights into the selectivity are presented.







Abstract
We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition of anilines to trisubstituted heterocyclic chloroalkenes provides an intermediate 1,2&#8208;chloroamine. Diastereocontrol was found to vary significantly with solvent selection, with computational modelling confirming selective, spontaneous fragmentation in the presence of trace acids, proceeding through a pseudo&#8208;cyclic, protonated intermediate and transition state. These chloroamines can then be converted to the aziridine by treatment with LiHMDS with high stereochemical fidelity. This solvent&#8208;induced stereochemical enrichment thereby enables an efficient route to rare cis&#8208;aziridines with high dr. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic origins of selectivity are also presented.

         <title>Poly(vinyl chloride) Dechlorination Catalyzed by Zirconium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic amidozirconocene catalyst is shown to dechlorinate poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) under mild conditions in the presence of triethylsilane as a hydrogen donor. PVC additives containing carbonyl functional groups (e.&#8201;g. phthalates, poly(vinyl acetate)) underwent complete hydrosilylation. A procedure is reported for the deconvolution of catalyst poisoning effects by PVC additives.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl chloride) undergoes dechlorination in the presence of triethylsilane (Et3SiH) and a catalytic amount of [Cp2Zr(NPh2)][CH3B(C6F5)3] (1&#8201;b) at 40&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, with up to 91&#8201;% efficiency. Stoichiometric reactivity studies conducted on cyclohexyl chloride as a model suggest that 1&#8201;b dechlorinates PVC by initial chloride abstraction, followed by hydride transfer to the cationic PVC chain from Et3SiH. Consumer items such as pipe fitting, vinyl disc or electric cable insulation undergo either dechlorination or hydrosilylation of the carbonyl&#8208;containing copolymer (polyvinyl acetate) or plasticizer (phthalate).

         <title>Construction of Bidentate Phosphines Enabled by Photoinduced Reductive Diphosphination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination of alkenes was realized for the synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines. The Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals, which served as an ideal phosphine source for alkene diphosphination under reducing conditions.







Abstract
The diphosphination of alkenes through a radical pathway offers a promising approach for the rapid construction of aryl bisphosphines. However, such a synthetic strategy has not been successfully applied to the preparation of alkyl bisphosphines, partially due to the difficulties in the generation of phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals from common alkyl phosphine compounds. We herein demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by hiring Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine as the phosphine source that can act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals. With this novel strategy, a photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination reaction has been established, allowing for a straightforward synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines.

         <title>Toward Efficient and Stereoselective Aromatic and Dearomative Cope Rearrangements: Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of &#945;&#8208;Allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Aromatic &#947;&#8208;Lactone Derivatives.</title>

Fine&#8208;tuning substituents of the 1,5&#8208;hexadiene motif supported by calculations enable the stereoselective dearomative or aromatic Cope rearrangements of &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8242;&#8208;heteroaromatic lactones, overcoming the drastic thermodynamic and kinetic requirements of such reactions.







Abstract
The aromatic Cope rearrangement is an elusive transformation that has been the subject of a limited number of investigations compared to those seemingly close analogues, namely the Cope and aromatic Claisen rearrangement. Herein we report our investigations inspired by moderate success observed in the course of pioneering works. By careful experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate that key substitutions on 1,5&#8208;hexadiene scaffold allow fruitful transformations. Especially, efficient functionalisation of the heteroaromatic rings results from the aromatic Cope rearrangement, while highly stereoselective interrupted aromatic Cope rearrangements highlight the formation of chiral compounds through a dearomative process.

Cooperate and you will get it: The masked FLPs depicted in the Scheme activate dihydrogen and the usually spectator Cp* ligand undergoes reductive elimination and H/D exchange processes.







Abstract
The masked transition&#8208;metal frustrated Lewis pairs [Cp*M(&#954;3N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;L)][SbF6] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; M=Ir, 1, Rh, 2; HL=pyridinyl&#8208;amidine ligand) reversibly activate H2 under mild conditions rendering the hydrido derivatives [Cp*MH(&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;HL)][SbF6] observed as a mixture of the E and Z isomers at the amidine C=N bond (M=Ir, 3Z, 3E; M=Rh, 4Z, 4E). DFT calculations indicate that the formation of the E isomers follows a Grotthuss type mechanism in the presence of water. A mixture of Rh(I) isomers of formula [(Cp*H)Rh(&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;HL)][SbF6] (5&#8201;a&#8211;d) is obtained by reductive elimination of Cp*H from 4. The formation of 5&#8201;a&#8211;d was elucidated by means of DFT calculations. Finally, when 2 reacts with D2, the Cp* and Cp*H ligands of the resulting rhodium complexes 4 and 5, respectively, are deuterated as a result of a reversible hydrogen abstraction from the Cp* ligand and D2 activation at rhodium.

         <title>Glutathione Protects other Cellular Thiols against Oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>

Di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) exhibits potent anticancer activity at submicromolar concentration in cell culture. A proposed mode of action is the production of hydroxyl radicals (HO&#8901;) upon copper coordination (CuII&#8208;Dp44mT) and thiol oxidation. The evaluation of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT reactivity with several biologically relevant thiols suggested that glutathione (GSH) could protect cysteine (Cys), free or in proteins, against oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;thiosemicarbazones have been intensively investigated for their application in cancer therapy or as antimicrobials. Copper(II)&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;thiosemicarbazone (CuII&#8208;Dp44mT) showed anticancer activity in the submicromolar concentration range in cell culture. The interaction of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT with thiols leading to their depletion or inhibition was proposed to be involved in this activity. Indeed, CuII&#8208;Dp44mT can catalyze the oxidation of thiols although with slow kinetics. The present work aims to obtain insights into the catalytic activity and selectivity of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT toward the oxidation of different biologically relevant thiols. Reduced glutathione (GSH), L&#8208;cysteine (Cys), N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC), D&#8208;penicillamine (D&#8208;Pen), and the two model proteins glutaredoxin (Grx) and thioredoxin (Trx) were investigated. CuII&#8208;Dp44mT catalyzed the oxidation of these thiols with different kinetics, with rates in the following order D&#8208;Pen&gt;Cys&#8811;NAC&gt;GSH and Trx&gt;Grx. CuII&#8208;Dp44mT was more efficient than CuII chloride for the oxidation of NAC and GSH, but not D&#8208;Pen and Cys. In mixtures of biologically relevant concentrations of GSH and either Cys, Trx, or Grx, the oxidation kinetics and spectral properties were similar to that of GSH alone, indicating that the interaction of these thiols with CuII&#8208;Dp44mT is dominated by GSH. Hence GSH could protect other thiols against potential deleterious oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on &#955;5&#8208;Phosphinine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive blue &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are newly designed and developed. Among these, methylester&#8208;containing CO2Me&#8208;CHO exhibites very high photoluminescent quantum yield of 94&#8201;%, and external quantum efficiency of 4.18&#8201;% in OLED.







Abstract
Although &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are known as a promising class of blue fluorescent emitters, those photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values have been reached up to 92&#8201;%, however, only a few examples have been explored as an emitter for blue organic light&#8208;emitting device (OLED), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) has been below 2.4&#8201;% so far. In this study, we newly developed two types of blue &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives namely CN&#8208;COCF3 and CO2Me&#8208;CHO, and investigated the photophysical properties in the solid states. The photophysical analyses in solid state films suggested that the strong electron&#8208;accepting nature of these &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives caused the inferior PLQY values, and the exciplex formation with the host and neighboring materials should be avoided to improve the device efficiency. By choosing suitable host and neighboring materials with deep ionization potentials, we successfully realized efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs with EQE of over 4&#8201;% and CIE (0.14, 0.18). This is among the best in &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;based blue OLEDs so far.

This is among the best in &#955;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine-based blue OLEDs so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Manipulation of Well&#8208;Defined Trinuclear Pd(II)&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trinuclear palladium acetate undergoes selective two&#8208; or four&#8208;fold acetate exchange with tridentate donor&#8208;appended aminophenol ligands to afford well&#8208;defined Pd3 platforms. The overall structure and composition for the bisligated species depends on the ligand used. Initial follow&#8208;up ligand exchange chemistry with some of these Pd3&#8208;species underlines the structural integrity of the Pd3 core.







Abstract
Several strategies are available to design well&#8208;defined multimetallic molecular entities bearing functional ligands. Substoichiometric exchange reactions in the coordination sphere of pre&#8208;existing multinuclear precursors are relatively underexploited in this context. Palladium(II) acetate is not a mononuclear compound in the solid state but rather exists as a trimer, i.&#8201;e. [Pd3(OAc)6]. Although this material is ubiquitously used to synthesize mononuclear Pd species, it may principally also lend itself to selective exchange of some of the edge&#8208;sharing acetate units in its triangular motif, whilst keeping the overall multinuclear architecture intact. Strikingly, little is known about the controlled manipulation and substoichiometric substitution chemistry of this well&#8208;defined conglomerate. We herein conclusively demonstrate that, for the first time, the targeted exchange of two or four acetate units from the Pd3(acetate)6 platform is possible, thereby installing either one or two new tridentate ligands onto this trinuclear architecture. Follow&#8208;up exchange and substitution chemistry is available without disrupting the multimetallic nature of the core structure. New complexes 2&#8211;7 are all conclusively characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

Emissive ionic frameworks are designed by associating blue emissive tetraphenylethylene moieties functionalized with four imidazolium heads and red&#8208;NIR phosphorescent dianionic Mo or tetracationic Re&#8208;based octahedral clusters. Resulting hybrids show a porous structure in their crystalline state and their chemical and thermal stability depends on the charge of the metal cluster. Emission in the red&#8208;NIR by 1PA and 2PA were evidenced in both cases.







Abstract
Emissive ionic supramolecular frameworks are designed by associating tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetra&#8208;cationic units and di&#8208;anionic molybdenum or tetra&#8208;anionic rhenium octahedral clusters. Obtained structures were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The emission properties of the hybrids were investigated as dry powders or in various solvents by one photon and two photon absorption leading to a O2 concentration dependent luminescence color for the Mo based hybrid.

         <title>From the Iron Pentacarbonyl Cation to Heteroleptic &#951;6&#8208;arene Carbonyls and bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene Cations</title>

Access to low valent iron chemistry: Substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]+[WCA]&#8722; generates bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+/2+([WCA]&#8722;)1/2 (arene=C6H6, C6H3Me3, C6H5F). Partial substitution gives the heteroleptic cations [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]+[WCA]&#8722; (arene=C6H6, C6H3Me3, C6H5F, mes*). These salts have been characterized by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR and XRD analysis as well as computational methods.







Abstract
Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]&#8901;+ (arene=1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)2]&#8901;+ was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) salt. Chemical electronation, i.&#8201;e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)2], whereas further deelectronation under CO&#8208;pressure leads to a dicationic three&#8208;legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)3]2+ salt with [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]&#8901;+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis&#8208;arene salts [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]2+([Al(ORF)4]&#8722;)2 (arene=1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis&#8208;arene cation salt [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+ salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C6H6)2]2+ salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.

Gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfoxides were obtained in a simple procedure from sulfoxonium ylides, in a different reaction mode from the classical behaviour (geminal addition of a nucleophile and electrophile, followed by sulfoxide extrusion. Experimental studies give insight to the mechanism of the reaction, with a change in the RDS according with ylide substitution. Sulfur&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing organic compounds are quite attractive and important in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8211;80&#8201;% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.

We report a stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to linearly fused polycyclic piperidines from readily available substrates. These products can be chemoselectively functionalized to generate analogs that represent common substructures in bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Linearly fused polycyclic piperidines represent common substructures in natural products and biologically active small molecules. We have devised a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to these compounds that converts readily available 2&#8208;tetralones and indanones into these scaffolds with the potential for control of both enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Importantly, these compounds can be chemoselectively functionalized, providing an efficient and robust methodology to these important nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Insulating 6,6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric Acid Methyl Ester on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides: Impact of the Hybrid Materials on the Optical and Electrical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
The PCBM was insulated onto the surfaces of ten transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) through covalent functionalization. Comprehensive studies were conducted on their optical and electronic properties, including photoluminescence, conductivity, and photo&#8208;response. PCBM customized the properties of each TMDs, classifying them into three groups based on alignment: type I, type II, and metallic.







Abstract
In this study we develop a strategy to insulate 6,6 &#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Concretely single layers of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 and ultrathin MoO2 and WO2 were grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the thiol group of a PCBM modified with cysteine reacts with the chalcogen vacancies on the basal plane of TMDs, yielding PCBM&#8208;MoS2, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WS2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2, PCBM&#8208;WTe2, PCBM&#8208;MoO2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700&#8201;% and 200&#8201;% in PCBM&#8208;MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM&#8208;MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2&#8208;fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1&#8197;eV. On the other hand, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2 and PCBM&#8208;WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8211;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37&#8208;154&#8197;eV along with an enhancement of the photo&#8208;response by 2400, 3200 and 600&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM&#8208;WTe2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2 showed a modest photo&#8208;response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.

A synthetic method has been developed for [1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs), which are attracting a great deal of attention as organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The advantage of the method is its simplicity, namely, heating readily available 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur in the presence of molecular iodine. Iodine plays a very important role in the reaction, as discussed in the proposed reaction pathways.







Abstract
[1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8722;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.

Graphical Abstract. An efficient, gold&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides to prepare 3&#8208;hydoxyl tetrahydropyran motifs is reported. This method also allows to construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers (MLP), emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis in biosynthesizing MLP toxins. In addition, tricyclic core of macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C is synthesized over 8 steps from known started material.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydropyran&#8208;fused poly&#8208;ethers scaffolds are found in many classes of natural products and medicinally relevant small molecules. Here we describe a catalytic system for 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran&#8208;derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers through emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated in the preparation of the tricyclic core of tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C.

Here we describe a catalytic system for 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; selective ring-opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran-derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder-like poly-ethers through emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated in the preparation of the tricyclic core of tetrahydropyran-containing macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Promoted Reductive Amination of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Amines for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step reductive amination reaction between DNA&#8208;conjugated amines and aromatic, aliphatic, or heterocyclic aldehydes, utilising the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, borate buffer, and NaBH4. The methodology is applicable to a broad substrate scope, with regards to both on&#8208;DNA amine and aldehyde, and is fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing; it is a new method for secondary and tertiary amine formation in DEL synthesis.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a leading technology for hit identification in drug discovery projects as large, diverse libraries can be generated. DELs are commonly synthesised via split&#8208;and&#8208;pool methodology; thus, chemical transformations utilised must be highly efficient, proceeding with high conversions. Reactions performed in DEL synthesis also require a broad substrate scope to produce diverse, drug&#8208;like libraries. Many pharmaceutical compounds incorporate multiple C&#8722;N bonds, over a quarter of which are synthesised via reductive aminations. However, few on&#8208;DNA reductive amination procedures have been developed. Herein is reported the application of the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, to the on&#8208;DNA reductive amination of DNA&#8208;conjugated amines, yielding highly efficient conversions with a broad range of aldehydes, including medicinally relevant heterocyclic and aliphatic substrates. The procedure is compatible with DNA amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.

         <title>Stereocontrol via Propeller Chirality in FLP&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>

Chiral propeller&#8211;shaped triaryl framework of a binaphthyl&#8208;based amino&#8208;borane catalyst induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to prochiral iminiums in asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines.







Abstract
Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl&#8211;based chiral amino&#8211;borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well&#8211;defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro&#8211;chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino&#8211;borane catalyst through stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. This new computational insight can be readily used to interpret the high degree of stereoinduction observed for these reactions. We expect that the concept of chirality relay could be further exploited in catalyst design endeavors.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Lactones, Cyclopropanes and ATRA Products: Revealing the Role of Sodium Ascorbate
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry: A direct and mild photochemical synthesis of lactones, cyclopropanes and ATRA products, utilizing sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid as the halogen/hydrogen bonding mediator and irradiation at 370&#8197;nm, 390&#8197;nm or 427&#8197;nm LED as the irradiation source. A variety of iodo&#8208;reagents were activated via halogen or hydrogen bonding and reacted successfully with a number of alkenes without the use of an external photocatalyst, leading to products in good to excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated processes have received significant attention, since they have re&#8208;surfaced unconventional reactivity platforms, complementary to conventional polar chemistry. &#947;&#8208;Lactones and cyclopropanes are prevalent moieties, found in numerous natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods for their synthesis, light&#8208;mediated protocols are coming to the spotlight, although these are contingent upon the use of photoorgano&#8208; or metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we introduce a novel photochemical activation of iodo&#8208;reagents via the use of cheap sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid to enable their homolytic scission and addition onto double bonds. The developed protocol was applied successfully to the formal [3+2] cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, traditional atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions and the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step conversion of alkenes to cyclopropanes. In all cases, the desired products were obtained in good to high yields, while the reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated. Depending on the nature of the iodo&#8208;reagent, a halogen or a hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is formed, which initiates the process.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and Trifluoromethoxy Sulfur Pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) &#8211; Two Gaseous Sulfur(VI) Compounds with Insulating Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the great need for action to combat climate change, the replacement of the very potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as a dielectric is indispensable. The gases trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) offer better insulation properties than SF6, but are more easily degradable, which makes their use as dielectrics more environmentally friendly.







Abstract
In this work, we analyzed trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) regarding their potential use as dielectrics by investigating some of their intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Both compounds show a higher breakdown voltage than SF6 with averaged relative breakdown voltages of 1.3&#177;0.2 for CF3OSO2F and 1.4&#177;0.2 for CF3OSF5 compared to SF6 with 1.0. Like the dielectric (CF3)2CFCN, both compounds decompose during the breakdown process. The decomposition products were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and GCIR methods. Furthermore, the molecular structures of both gaseous compounds CF3OSO2F and CF3OSF5 have been determined by in&#8197;situ crystallization, and their physical properties were determined as well.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Twostep Chemobiocatalytic Synthesis of a Furan Amino Acid from 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemobiocatalytic tandem process toward 5&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC) was developed by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and a whole&#8208;cell catalyst in a single reaction vessel, starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and inexpensive ammonium formate. The desired product was obtained with 81&#8201;% yield. More importantly, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41&#8197;g/L&#8201;h productivity.







Abstract
Recently, catalytic valorization of biomass&#8208;derived furans has received growing interest. 5&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC), a furan amino acid, holds great promise in the aeras of polymer and pharmaceutical, but its synthesis remains limited. In this work, we report a chemobiocatalytic route toward AMFC by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and recombinant Escherichia coli (named E.&#8197;coli_TAF) harboring &#969;&#8208;transaminase (TA), L&#8208;alanine dehydrogenase (L&#8208;AlaDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In the cascade, HMF is oxidized into 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) by laccase&#8208;TEMPO system, and then the resulting intermediate is converted into AMFC by E.&#8197;coli_TAF via transamination with cheap ammonium formate instead of costly organic amine donors, theoretically generating H2O and CO2 as by&#8208;products. The tandem process was run in a one&#8208;pot twostep manner, affording AMFC with approximately 81&#8201;% yield, together with 10&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as by&#8208;product. In addition, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41&#8197;g/L&#8201;h productivity and 8.6&#8197;g/L titer. This work may pave the way for green manufacturing of the furan&#8208;containing amino acid.

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Hydridostannylene: A Masked Sn(I) Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity (including catalytic activity) of hydridostannylene (1&#8208;H2) with a variety of unsaturated (alkyne, carbonyl, azo) substrates has been reported. 1&#8208;H2 (e.&#8201;g.) undergoes dehydrogenative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with Ph2CO to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene 1&#8208;OCPh2, which readily liberates Ph2CO on exposure to H2 and regenerates 1&#8208;H2. Thus, 1&#8208;H2 behaves as a masked Sn&#8208;diradicaloid 1 that also affords 1&#8208;OCPh2 on treatment with Ph2CO.







Abstract
Herein, reactivity studies of a cyclic bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADC)SnH]2 (1&#8208;H2) (ADC=PhC{(NDipp)C}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with various unsaturated organic substrates are reported. Reactions of terminal alkynes (RC&#8801;CH) with 1&#8208;H2 afford mixed acetylide&#8208;vinyl&#8208;functionalized bis&#8208;stannylenes via dehydrogenation and hydrostannylation. Treatment of 1&#8208;H2 with PhC&#8801;CCH3 gives a unique distannabarrelene via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H stannylation and hydrostannylation of the C&#8801;CCH3 moiety. 1&#8208;H2 undergoes dehydrogenative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions with diphenylacetylene, azobenzene, acetone, benzophenone, and benzaldehyde to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene derivatives. The elimination of H2 in these reactions suggests the masked&#8208;diradical property of 1&#8208;H2. In fact, these [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition products are also accessible on treatments of the Sn(I) diradicaloid [(ADC)Sn]2 (1) with appropriate reagents. All compounds have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, the catalytic activity of 1&#8208;H2 has been shown for the hydroboration of unsaturated substrates.

         <title>Electrochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Alkyl Alkenesulfonates using Styrenes, SO2 and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first of its kind electrochemical approach for the direct synthesis of alkyl alkenesulfonates using styrenes, SO2 stock solution and alcohols was developed. The reaction features the in&#8208;situ generation of a monoalkylsulfite species with subsequent radical addition to an anodically oxidized styrene substrate. The applicability of the protocol was demonstrated with a broad scope as well as a gram&#8208;scale reaction.







Abstract
A novel electrochemical approach to access alkyl alkenesulfonates via a multicomponent reaction was developed. The metal&#8208;free method features easy&#8208;to&#8208;use SO2 stock solution forming monoalkylsulfites from alcohols with an auxiliary base in&#8208;situ. These intermediates serve a dual role as starting materials and as supporting electrolyte enabling conductivity. Anodic oxidation of the substrate styrene, radical addition of these monoalkylsulfites and consecutive second oxidation and deprotonation preserve the double bond and form alkyl &#946;&#8208;styrenesulfonates in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. The feasibility of this electrosynthetic method is demonstrated in 44 examples with yields up to 81&#8201;%, employing various styrenes and related substrates as well as a diverse set of alcohols. A gram&#8208;scale experiment underlines the applicability of this process, which uses inexpensive and readily available electrode materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of asymmetric reactions modulated by selenium compounds include a chiral selenophosphoramide Lewis base that catalyzes electrophilic and oxidative additions to alkenes, an ylide containing a terpene&#8208;based chiral auxiliary for cyclopropanations and a chiral selenide catalyst for photoredox cyclofunctionalizations.







Abstract
The discovery and synthetic applications of novel organoselenium compounds and their reactions proceeded rapidly during the past fifty years and such processes are now carried out routinely in many laboratories. At the same time, the growing demand for new enantioselective processes provided new challenges. The convergence of selenium chemistry and asymmetric synthesis led to key developments in the 1970s, although the majority of early work was based on stoichiometric processes. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on greener catalytic variations, along with the discovery of novel reactions and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. The present review covers the literature in this field from 2010 to early 2023 and encompasses asymmetric reactions mediated by chiral selenium&#8208;based reagents, auxiliaries, and especially, catalysts. Protocols based on achiral selenium compounds in conjunction with other species of chiral catalysts, as well as reactions that are controlled by chiral substrates, are also included.

         <title>Design Strategies toward High&#8208;Utilization Zinc Anodes for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This focused review summarizes the research status on developing high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries. Three major strategies in achieving high Zn utilization, including using ultrathin Zn foils, engineering Zn powder anodes, and designing substrates for Zn electrodeposition are systematically discussed. Future prospects for advancing the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries are proposed.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) hold a promise as the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their low cost and high specific energy. However, the actual energy density falls far below the requirements of commercial AZMBs due to the use of excessive Zn as anode and the associated issues including dendritic growth and side reactions. Reducing the N/P ratio (negative capacity/positive capacity) is an effective approach to achieve high energy density. A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity or tuning the Zn anode utilization to achieve low N/P ratio batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high&#8208;performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.

         <title>Structural Design of 3D Current Collectors for Lithium Metal Anodes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 21, April 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collector can solve the nature problem of hostless for Li, suppress the growth of Li dendrites and alleviate the volume expansion during repeated cycles. This review summarizes the recent development that facilitates the use of current collectors for Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Due to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low redox potential (&#8722;3.04&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) received increasing attentions. However, notorious dendrite and volume expansion during the cycling process seriously hinder the development of high energy density Li metal batteries. Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collectors for Li can fundamentally solve the intrinsic drawback of hostless for Li. Therefore, this review systematically introduces the design and synthesis engineering and the current development status of different 3D collectors in recent years (the current collectors are divided into two major parts: metal&#8208;based current collectors and carbon&#8208;based current collectors). In the end, some perspectives of the future promotion for LMA application are also presented.

In recent years, MSCs have developed rapidly. This review focuses on the large&#8208;scale fabrication and diverse applications of MSCs, discusses the latest advances in electrode materials and micro&#8208;nano fabrication technologies, and gives an overview of MSCs applications in key areas. Finally, the challenges faced by MSCs research, the future development direction are given.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors, emerging as promising micro&#8208;energy storage devices, have attracted significant attention due to their unique features. This comprehensive review focuses on two key aspects: the scalable fabrication of MSCs and their diverse applications. The review begins by elucidating the energy storage mechanisms and guiding principles for designing high&#8208;performance devices. It subsequently explores recent advancements in scalable fabrication techniques for electrode materials and micro&#8208;nano fabrication technologies for micro&#8208;devices. The discussion encompasses critical application domains, including multifunctional MSCs, energy storage integration, integrated power generation, and integrated applications. Despite notable progress, there are still some challenges such as large&#8208;scale production of electrode material, well&#8208;controlled fabrication technology, and scalable integrated manufacture. The summary concludes by emphasizing the need for future research to enhance micro&#8208;supercapacitor performance, reduce production costs, achieve large&#8208;scale production, and explore synergies with other energy storage technologies. This collective effort aims to propel MSCs from laboratory innovation to market viability, providing robust energy storage solutions for MEMS and portable electronics.

         <title>Driving Triplet State Population in Benzothioxanthene Imide Dyes: Let's twist!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle chemical modification in the bay area of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) was used to shed light on the closely intertwined connections between spin&#8208;orbit coupling, distortion of the &#960;&#8208;system, and intersystem crossing.







Abstract
Controlling the formation of photoexcited triplet states is critical for many (photo)chemical and physical applications. Here, we demonstrate that a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) dye promotes intersystem crossing by increasing spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This manipulation was achieved through a subtle chemical modification, specifically the bay&#8208;area methylation. Consequently, this simple yet efficient approach expands the catalog of known molecular engineering strategies for synthesizing heavy atom&#8208;free, dual redox&#8208;active, yet still emissive and synthetically accessible photosensitizers.

         <title>The Utilization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives Composite in Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation methods and electrochemical applications of MOFs and their derivatives composite materials in the field of supercapacitors are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and prospects of MOFs in supercapacitor are discussed.







Abstract
Up to now, the mainstream adoption of renewable energy has brought about substantial transformations in the electricity and energy sector. This shift has garnered considerable attention within the scientific community. Supercapacitors, known for their exceptional performance metrics like good charge/discharge capability, strong power density, as well as extended cycle longevity, have gained widespread traction across various sectors, including transportation and aviation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique traits including adaptable structure, highly customizable synthetic methods, and high specific surface area, have emerged as strong candidates for electrode materials. For enhancing the performance, MOFs are commonly compounded with other conducting materials to increase capacitance. This paper provides a detailed analysis of various common preparation strategies and characteristics of MOFs. It summarizes the recent application of MOFs and their derivatives as supercapacitor electrodes alongside other carbon materials, metal compounds, and conductive polymers. Additionally, the challenges encountered by MOFs in the realm of supercapacitor applications are thoroughly discussed. Compared to previous reviews, the content of this paper is more comprehensive, offering readers a deeper understanding of the diverse applications of MOFs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to now, the mainstream adoption of renewable energy has brought about substantial transformations in the electricity and energy sector. This shift has garnered considerable attention within the scientific community. Supercapacitors, known for their exceptional performance metrics like good charge/discharge capability, strong power density, as well as extended cycle longevity, have gained widespread traction across various sectors, including transportation and aviation. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique traits including adaptable structure, highly customizable synthetic methods, and high specific surface area, have emerged as strong candidates for electrode materials. For enhancing the performance, MOFs are commonly compounded with other conducting materials to increase capacitance. This paper provides a detailed analysis of various common preparation strategies and characteristics of MOFs. It summarizes the recent application of MOFs and their derivatives as supercapacitor electrodes alongside other carbon materials, metal compounds, and conductive polymers. Additionally, the challenges encountered by MOFs in the realm of supercapacitor applications are thoroughly discussed. Compared to previous reviews, the content of this paper is more comprehensive, offering readers a deeper understanding of the diverse applications of MOFs. Furthermore, it provides valuable suggestions and guidance for future progress and development in the field of MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Intramolecular Ferromagnetic Coupling in Tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Based Compounds through Spin Polarization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) J&#8208;coupling between spin&#8208;polarized&#8208;donor radicals like Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF+&#8901;) and Nitronyl&#8208;Nitroxide (NN) connected by a coupler, such as in BTBN, is a key ingredient to achieve magnetoresistant response. In silico modifications of BTBN accomplish the enhancement of the FM coupling by using hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene as coupler, while preserving BTBN&#8242;s structure, providing promising candidates for a (possibly) improved magnetoresistance material.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized donor radicals based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives and nitronyl nitroxide (NN) radicals in which one&#8208;electron oxidation involves the HOMO instead of the SOMO are well known for exhibiting magnetoresistance. In particular, BTBN consists of one dibromo&#8208;TTF and one NN radical, which are linked by a phenyl coupler group. One of the key factors driving magnetoresistance is the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the oxidized &#960;&#8208;donor (TTF+&#8901;, D unit) and NN (R unit). Here, a theoretical study is carried out to assess suitable candidates with enhanced FM coupling with respect BTBN, which is thus used as a reference. The study is conducted via in silico chemical modification of the substituents of the BTBN basic functional units (D and R radicals, C coupler) to benefit from the spin polarization mechanism to boost the intramolecular FM coupling, aiming to distort the BTBN radical arrangement within the molecular crystal as little as possible, in the event the material can be synthesized. NICSiso(1) and Wiberg's Bond Order are analyzed to further assist in identifying promising potential candidates, since the decrease in aromaticity is expected to enhance the diradical character and give rise to a larger magnetic coupling value. The most favorable diradical building block to replace the BTBN moiety results from using a hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene (&#8722;(H)C=C(OH)&#8722;) as a coupler preserving BTBN original radicals, namely, NN and TTF+&#8901; units. This study aims at illustrating the feasibility of improving the intramolecular FM interaction between radical moieties, which is fully realized, as a first step towards the synthesis of new materials with (possibly) enhanced magnetoresistance properties.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction to NH3 by Enhancing N2 Activation via Interaction between Au Nanoparticles and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;101(Fe) with a large specific surface area has a strong N2 adsorption capacity, which promotes the enrichment of N2 on the surface of the catalyst, and the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the activation of N2, thereby effectively promoting the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted much attention as a sustainable ammonia production technology, but it needs further exploration due to its slow kinetics and the existence of competitive side reactions. In this research, xAu/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) catalysts were obtained by loading gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto MIL&#8208;101(Fe) using a one&#8208;step reduction strategy. Herein, MIL&#8208;101(Fe), with high specific surface area and strong N2 adsorption capacity, is used as a support to disperse Au NPs to increase the electrochemical active surface area. Au NPs, with a high NRR activity, is introduced as the active site to promote charge transfer and intermediate formation rates. More importantly, the strong interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the electron transfer between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe), thereby enhancing the activation of N2 and achieving efficient NRR. Among the prepared catalysts, 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) has the highest NH3 yield of 46.37&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 39.38&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V (vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ FTIR reveals that the NRR mechanism of 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) follows the binding alternating pathway and also indicates that the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) strengthens the activation of the N&#8801;N bond in the rate&#8208;limiting process, thereby accelerating the NRR process.

         <title>Fingerprints of Chalcogen Bonding Revealed Through 77Se&#8208;NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oriented chemical shift tensor can reveal anisotropy in the electron density around a reporter nucleus. Here we measure the 77Se chemical shift tensor in a single crystal, which shows significant anisotropy due to participation of the selenium in a chalcogen bond. This technique suggests the presence of a potential second chalcogen bond site, which has not previously been observed in this system.







Abstract
77Se&#8208;NMR is used to characterise several chalcogen bonded complexes of derivatives of the organoselenium drug ebselen, exploring a range of electron demand. NMR titration experiments support the intuitive understanding that chalcogen bond donors bearing more electron withdrawing substituents give rise stronger chalcogen bonds. The chemical shift of the selenium nucleus is also shown to move upfield as it participates in a chalcogen bond. Solid&#8208;state NMR is used to explore chalcogen bonding in co&#8208;crystals. Due to the lack of molecular reorientation on the NMR timescale in the solid state, the shape of the chemical shift tensor can be determined using this technique. A range of co&#8208;crystals are shown to have extremely large chemical shift anisotropy, which suggests a strongly anisotropic electron density distribution around the selenium atom. A single crystal NMR experiment was conducted using one of the co&#8208;crystals, affording the absolute orientation of the chemical shift tensor within the crystal. This showed that the selenium nucleus is strongly shielded in the direction of the chalcogen bond (due to the approach of the lone pair of the Lewis base), and strongly deshielded in the perpendicular direction. The orientation of the deshielded axis is consistent with the presence of a second &#963;&#8208;hole which is not participating in a chalcogen bond, showing the profound effect of electron density anisotropy on the chemical shift.

         <title>Chiral Spiro&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalenes: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties, Conformational Issues and Charge Transfer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;TTFs have been characterized experimentally and theoretically, and the formation of charge transfer complexes with TCNQF2 and TCNQF4 has been reported. The chiroptical investigation of the neutral systems revealed significant differences in chiroptical activity depending on the nature of chiral centres and between diastereomers.







Abstract
Within this work we have investigated spiro&#8208;based tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) obtained as mixtures of stereoisomers from racemic spiro[5.5]undeca&#8208;1,8&#8208;dien&#8208;3&#8208;one. Compared to previously described spiro&#8208;TTFs, enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric forms have been here separated by chiral HPLC and fully characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The two types of spiro&#8208;based chiral derivatives contain either one (2) or three (1) chiral centres out of each one is spiro&#8208;type. Experimental CD, supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations, shows differences in the optical activity between the 1 and 2 and their intermediates. The low optical activity of 2 and 3 (spiro alone chirality) was attributed to the presence of two conformers in the solution (ax and eq) of opposite Cotton effect whereas in the case of 1 and 5 (spiro and stereogenic centres) the spiro chirality seems to be responsible of the Cotton effect in the high energy region whereas the R and S chirality in the low energy region. Racemic and enantiopure forms have been successfully used for the synthesis of charge transfer complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) based acceptors.

Racemic and enantiopure forms have been successfully used for the synthesis of charge transfer complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) based acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculation predict double and single M&#246;bius aromaticity in the global minimum geometries of Rh2B2 and RhB2&#8722; clusters. Heavier analogue Ir2B2 follows the same type of aromaticity, albeit being non&#8208;planar. Aromaticity of these clusters have been confirmed by various analysis.







Abstract
Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n&#8197;electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8722; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Oriented Asymmetric Catalysis: Conformational Modulation of Transition State Multivalency during a Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Assembly of a Pharmaceutically Relevant Atropisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Albeit of significative recent pharmaceutical interest, there is an almost complete absence of asymmetric methods to deliver enantioenriched, axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinazolinediones. Posed with the challenge of establishing such a catalytic method, we developed a new class of superbasic bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts. In addition, we carried out extensive computational modeling to dissect the role of the individual elements in governing the catalyst's activity and selectivity.







Abstract
A new class of superbasic, bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts is presented, which enables the organocatalytic, atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral quinazolinediones. Computational modeling unveiled the conformational modulation of the catalyst by a novel phenyl urea N&#8208;cap, that preorganizes the structure into the active, folded state. A previously unanticipated noncovalent interaction involving a difluoroacetamide acting as a hybrid mono&#8208; or bidentate hydrogen bond donor emerged as a decisive control element inducing atroposelectivity. These discoveries spurred from a scaffold&#8208;oriented project inspired from a fascinating investigational BTK inhibitor featuring two stable chiral axes and relies on a mechanistic framework that was foreign to the extant lexicon of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Substitution Lability of the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] Towards Triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper we present the structural diversity of products formed upon substitution of the labile perfluorinated Cp* ligand [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) by triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi).







Abstract
Triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi) are able to displace the perfluorinated Cp* ligand in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in up to quantitative yield. The resulting ionic products contain [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; as uncoordinated counter anion. The cations feature [Rh(COD)]+ fragments, coordinated by one (N, Bi), two (P, As) or three (Sb) triphenylpnictogen moieties. Whereas coordination via the pnictogen is observed for P, As and Sb, &#960;&#8208;coordination of the aryl rings is observed for N and Bi.

         <title>Theoretical Study of the Ternary Compound Monolayer CuP2Se for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Efficient Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing photocatalytic method to produce hydrogen by splitting water is an efficient strategy to solve the hotspot issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution. Herein, we systematically investigate the corresponding properties of the reported Cu&#8208;bearing ternary compound monolayer CuP2Se by using the first&#8208;principle calculations. The monolayer CuP2Se has quite small cleavage energy of 0.51 J/m2, indicating it can be easily produced by the mechanical exfoliation method experimentally. In addition, it is an indirect bandgap semiconductor material which has a moderate value of 1.91 eV. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) can perfectly straddle the redox potentials of water when a biaxial strain of &#8208;4% to 4% is applied, unveiling the high photocatalytic thermodynamic stability of monolayer CuP2Se in response to the effect of solvent tension. Remarkably, the monolayer CuP2Se also demonstrates significant sunlight capturing ability in the visible region. The outstanding electronic and optical properties suggest that the monolayer CuP2Se is undoubtedly a viable material for photocatalytic water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Smartphone&#8208;Based Sensing of Cortisol by Functionalized Rhodamine Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During a stress condition, the human body synthesizes catecholamine neurotransmitters and specific hormones (called &#8220;stress hormones&#8221;), the most important of which is cortisol. The monitoring of cortisol levels should be extremely important to control the stress levels, and for this reason, it shows important medical applications. The common analytical methods (HPLC, GC&#8208;MS) cannot be used in real life, due to the bulky size of the instruments and the necessity of specialized personnel. Molecular probes solve these problems due to their fast and easy use. The synthesis of new fluorescent rhodamine probes, able to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, the recognition properties in solution as well as in solid state by Strip Test, using a smartphone as detector, are here reported. DFT calculations and FT&#8208;IR measurements suggest the formation of supramolecular complexes through hydrogen bonds as main non&#8208;covalent interaction. The present study represents one of the first sensor, based on synthetical chemical receptors, able to detect cortisol in a linear range from 1 mM to 1 pM, based on non&#8208;covalent molecular recognition and paves the way to the realization of practical point&#8208;of&#8208;care device for the monitoring of cortisol in real live.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present &#8216;Concept&#8217; provides a comprehensive review of recent strides in continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, employing a packed&#8208;bed reactor featuring immobilized palladium complexes. Emphasis is placed on meticulously designed catalyst structures and the innovative reaction technologies employed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, accentuating their pivotal roles in the establishment of a pragmatic synthesis process.







Abstract
Immobilized Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using a packed&#8208;bed reactor, representing an efficient, automated, practical, and safe technology compared to conventional batch&#8208;type reactions. The core objective of this study is the development of an active and durable catalyst. In contrast to supported Pd nanoparticles, the attachment of Pd complexes onto solid supports through well&#8208;defined coordination sites is considered a favorable approach for preparing highly dispersed and stabilized Pd species. These species can be directly employed in various flow reactions without the need for pre&#8208;treatment. This concept paper explores recent achievements involving the application of immobilized Pd complexes as precatalysts for continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. Our focus is to elucidate the significance of the designed catalyst structures in relation to their catalytic performance under flow conditions. Additionally, we highlight various reaction systems and catalyst packing methods, emphasizing their crucial roles in establishing a practical synthesis process.

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. Antimicrobial peptides are found to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates, leading to clustering or even to the formation of fibrillar structures. Such morphological transformations are expected to impair the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly.







Abstract
Recently, the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as excellent candidates for overcoming antibiotic resistance has attracted significant attention. AMPs are short peptides active against bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. It has been shown that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. These biocondensates are crucial for viral replication as they concentrate the viral RNA with the host cell&#8216;s protein machinery required for viral protein expression. Thus, N&#8722;P biocondensates are promising targets to block or slow down viral RNA transcription and consequently virion assembly. We investigated the ability of three AMPs to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates. Using microscopy techniques, supported by biophysical characterization, we found that the AMP LL&#8211;III partitions into the condensate, leading to clustering. Instead, the AMP CrACP1 partitions into the droplets without affecting their morphology but reducing their dynamics. Conversely, GKY20 leads to the formation of fibrillar structures after partitioning. It can be expected that such morphological transformation severely impairs the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly. These results could pave the way for the development of a new class of AMP&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting biocondensates.

         <title>Injectable Chitosan Hydrogels Doped with 2D Peptide Nanosheet&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Sustained Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule&#8208;responsive drug release system based on 2D peptide nanosheets (PNSs) has been developed by using chitosan (CS) hydrogel as a sustained&#8208;release platform. The PNS&#8208;CS&#8208;based drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, and the improved cellular uptake shown offers potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective drug delivery systems aimed at enhancing therapeutic profile and efficacy of therapeutic agents is a critical challenge in modern medicine. This study presents an intelligent drug delivery system based on self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional peptide nanosheets (2D PNSs). Leveraging the tunable properties of amino acid structures and sequences, we design a peptide with the sequence of Fmoc&#8208;FKKGSHC, which self&#8208;assembles into 2D PNSs with uniform structure, high biocompatibility, and excellent degradability. Covalent attachment of thiol&#8208;modified doxorubicin (DOX) drugs to 2D PNSs via disulfide bond results in the peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs), which is denoted as PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX. Subsequently, the PDCs are encapsulated within the injectable, thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogels for drug delivery. The designed drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, which are facilitated by the characteristics of the CS hydrogels. Meanwhile, the covalently linked disulfide bond within the PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX is responsive to intracellular glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells, enabling controlled drug release and significantly inhibiting the cancer cell growth. This responsive peptide&#8208;drug conjugate based on a 2D peptide nanoplatform paves the way for the development of smart drug delivery systems and has bright prospects in the future biomedicine field.

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Free Radicals in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated radicals have good redox properties, thus promoting the widespread application of photocatalysis for environmental treatment and organic synthesis. The generation and application of photogenerated radicals are related to carriers and reactive molecules, such as a variety of alkane radicals in photocatalytic dissolution. In this conceptual article, we discuss some basic properties of photogenerated radicals and recent related research work.







Abstract
Free radicals are increasingly recognized as active intermediate reactive species that can participate in various redox processes, significantly influencing the mechanistic pathways of reactions. Numerous researchers have investigated the generation of one or more distinct photogenerated radicals, proposing various hypotheses to explain the reaction mechanisms. Notably, recent research has demonstrated the emergence of photogenerated radicals in innovative processes, including organic chemical reactions and the photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals. To harness the potential of these free radicals more effectively, it is imperative to consolidate and analyze the processes and action modes of these photogenerated radicals. This conceptual paper delves into the latest advancements in understanding the mechanics of photogenerated radicals.

         <title>Modular Divergent Synthesis of Indole Alkaloid Derivatives by an Atypical Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex pentacyclic ketimine undergoes a fully diastereoselective Ugi&#8208;type multicomponent reaction with various isocyanides and carboxylic acids to give a range of non&#8208;natural indole alkaloid derivatives. DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds via a hydrogen bonding mechanism and that the stereoselectivity is primarily governed by ring strain considerations.







Abstract
We present an Ugi multicomponent approach to explore the chemical space around Aspidosperma&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. By variation of the isocyanide and carboxylic acid inputs we demonstrate the rapid generation of molecular diversity and the possibility to introduce handles for further modification. The key Ugi three&#8208;component reaction showed full diastereoselectivity towards the cis&#8208;fused ring system, which can be rationalized by DFT calculations that moreover indicate that the reaction proceeds via a Passerini&#8208;type hydrogen bonding mechanism. Several post&#8208;Ugi modifications were also performed, including Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to highly complex nonacyclic natural product hybrid scaffolds.

Temperature and pressure dependence of the glycolytic G6PDH reaction forming NADPH/PLL droplets as the enzymatic reaction proceeds: Incorporation of the reactants in the droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures.







Abstract
Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate to 6&#8208;phospho&#8208;D&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation.

&lt;p&gt;Temperature and pressure dependence of the glycolytic G6PDH reaction forming NADPH/PLL droplets as the enzymatic reaction proceeds: Incorporation of the reactants in the droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium-high pressures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation. Here, the nucleotide serves as substrate as well as the scaffold required for the formation of liquid droplets. To further expand the process parameter space, temperature and pressure dependent measurements were performed. Incorporation of the reactants in the liquid droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium-high pressures. The crowded environment of the droplet phase induced a marked increase of the affinity of the enzyme and substrate. An increase in turnover number in the droplet phase at high pressure contributed to a further strong increase in catalytic efficiency. Enzyme systems that are dynamically coupled to liquid condensate formation may be the key to deciphering many biochemical reactions. Expanding the process parameter space by adjusting temperature and pressure conditions can be a means to further increase the efficiency of industrial enzyme utilization and help uncover regulatory mechanisms adopted by extremophiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Control of the Temperature Responsiveness of Fluorescent Macrocyclic Molecular Rotamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular motion of macrocyclic carbazole macrocycles (CarROTs) is controlled through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation allowing four discreet rotational speeds to be accessed, which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system.







Abstract
To fully harness the potential of molecular machines, it is crucial to develop methods by which to exert control over their speed of motion through the application of external stimuli. A conformationally strained macrocyclic fluorescent rotamer, CarROT, displays a reproducible and linear fluorescence decrease towards temperature over the physiological temperature range. Through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation, the compound can access four discreet rotational speeds via supramolecular interactions (very slow, slow, fast and very fast) which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system. Through comparison with analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom, the high thermosensitivity of CarROT over the physiological temperature range was determined to be due to conformational strain, which causes a high energy barrier to rotation over this range. Analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom display lower sensitivities towards temperature over the same temperature range. This study provides an example of an information rich small molecule, in which programable rotational speed states can be observed with facile read&#8208;out.

         <title>Genetically Fusing Order&#8208;Promoting and Thermoresponsive Building Blocks to Design Hybrid Biomaterials</title>

         <dc:description>
This review discusses strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of intrinsically disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) through genetic fusion with ordered helical or beta sheet domains, aiming to generate well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials on the nanoscale.







Abstract
The unique biophysical and biochemical properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their recombinant derivatives, intrinsically disordered protein polymers (IDPPs) offer opportunities for producing multistimuli&#8208;responsive materials; their sequence&#8208;encoded disorder and tendency for phase separation facilitate the development of multifunctional materials. This review highlights the strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs), and their self&#8208;assembled structures via genetic fusion to ordered motifs such as helical or beta sheet domains. In particular, this review describes approaches that harness the synergistic interplay between order&#8208;promoting and thermoresponsive building blocks to design hybrid biomaterials, resulting in well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials ordered on the nanoscale.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Revision of a Natural Tetrasaccharide from Starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell</title>

The synthesis and structural revision of the natural 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated tetrasaccharides via dual DPPA&#8208;directed [2+2] glycosylation.







Abstract
Starfish provide important saponins with diverse bioactivities as the secondary metabolites, among which 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides are commonly found. Preparation of those 1,2&#8208;trans 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides usually relies on 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation requiring the selective installation and cleavage of 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl groups. A convergent synthesis using 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated oligosaccharide donors would be more straightforward but also pose greater challenges. Herein, we report a convergent synthesis of a distinctive tetrasaccharide isolated from starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell. Dual 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) groups at O3 and O4 on galactose moiety led to high &#946;&#8208;selectivities (&#946;/&#945;=12/1 or &#946; only) in the challenging [2+2] glycosylation, giving the desired tetrasaccharides in &gt;90&#8201;% yields from the 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated disaccharide donors. These synthetic studies have also unambiguously revised the structure of these natural tetrasaccharides. This work would facilitate further studies on new inhibitors of &#945;&#8208;glucosidase as hypoglycemic drugs.

         <title>A Healable Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Balanced Toughness and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte, rooted in poly(urethane&#8208;urea) chemistry, has been synthesized by a post immersion method, which allows for precise manipulation of its mechanical and electrical properties. This polymer electrolyte demonstrates exceptional dendritic resistance and outstanding self&#8208;healing features, with significant potential for application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered extensive attention as potential alternatives to traditional liquid electrolytes, primarily due to their prowess in curbing lithium dendrite formation and preventing electrolyte leaks. The quest for SPEs that are both mechanically robust and exhibit superior ionic conductivity has been vigorous. However, achieving a harmonious balance between these two attributes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte, ingeniously crafted from a poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network, enriched with lithium salts and plasticizers. This innovative composition not only boasts remarkable toughness but also ensures commendable ionic conductivity. Our post&#8208;gelation method yields gel polymer electrolytes that undergo rigorous evaluation, leading to an optimized version that stands out with its exceptional room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (2.94&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and outstanding toughness (11.9 MJ m&#8722;3). Moreover, it demonstrates a broad electrochemical window (4.73&#8197;V), remarkable stability across a 600&#8208;hour cycle test, a high capacity retention exceeding 80&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C, and a noteworthy self&#8208;healing capability. This quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte emerges as a promising contender to replace current liquid electrolyte solutions.

         <title>Synthesis of Superbulky Amide Ligands by Addition of Polar Reagents to Sila&#8211;Imine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superbulky amide ligands are generally not accessible by deprotonation of their parent amines. Addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8208;imine precursor gave a range of metal complexes with superbulky amide ligands that generally act as weakly coordinating anions.







Abstract
The chemistry of extremely bulky amide ligands is troubled by difficulties in deprotonation of the parent amine. As an alternative route to superbulky amide reagents, the addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8211;imine has been investigated. Attempts to synthesize the superbulky amide anion (tBu3Si)2N&#8722; by addition of tBuLi to tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) failed and gave tBu3Si(tBu2HSi)NLi and isobutene. Reaction of the sila&#8211;imine with KOtBu successfully led to tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NK which crystallized as a separated ion&#8211;pair.

     alt="Synthesis of Superbulky Amide Ligands by Addition of Polar Reagents to Sila&#8211;Imine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superbulky amide ligands are generally not accessible by deprotonation of their parent amines. Addition of polar reagents to a sila-imine precursor gave a range of metal complexes with superbulky amide ligands that generally act as weakly coordinating anions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of extremely bulky amide ligands is troubled by difficulties in deprotonation of the parent amine. As an alternative route to superbulky amide reagents, the addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8211;imine has been investigated. Attempts to synthesize the superbulky amide anion (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by addition of &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuLi to &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si=N(Si&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) failed and gave &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HSi)NLi and &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;butene. Reaction of the sila&#8211;imine with KO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu successfully led to &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si[&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuO)Si]NK which crystallized as a separated ion&#8211;pair. Reaction with the slightly bulkier KOAd (Ad=1-adamantyl) led in presence of THF to ether ring&#8211;opening. Reaction with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOH gave &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si[&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuO)Si]NH but this amine cannot be easily deprotonated. Reaction with (BDI*)Mg&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu in presence of THF gave (BDI*)Mg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the non&#8211;coordinating anion &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si[&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)Si]N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; BDI*=&lt;i&gt;&#223;&lt;/i&gt;-diketiminate ligand HC[C(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)N&#8722;DIPP]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DIPP=2,6-di&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;propylphenyl. Reaction of Mg(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si=N(Si&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) led to a Mg complex with one amide ligand: &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si[&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)Si]N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The other superbulky amide anion isomerized by internal deprotonation of a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu-substituent to give a primary carbanion that is also coordinated to Mg. Although the amide&#8211;to&#8211;carbanion isomerization is highly contrathermodynamic, it allows for coordination of both anions to a single Mg center.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction is an efficient method for the mono&#8208;selective activation of the C&#8211;F bond on a trifluoromethyl group to construct a difluoroalkyl group. We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer (EDA&#8208;SET) of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8211;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Mechanistic studies revealed the generation of a &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl radical by single&#8208;electron reduction and defluorination, followed by the radical addition to alkenes. Lithium salt interacted with the fluorine atom to promote the photoinduced reduction mediated by the EDA complex. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET). FCET is a novel approach to C&#8211;F bond activation for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Introduction of the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group into organic compounds has garnered substantial interest because of its significant role in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we report a hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated radical process for C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes. The reaction shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity (up to &gt; 20:1), and broad functional group compatibility.

         <title>Dehydro[12]&#8208; and [18]annulene&#8208;Fused Ball&#8208;Shaped Ruthenium Complex Oligomers: Synthesis, Aromatic/Antiaromatic Effect, and Symmetry for Near&#8208;Infrared Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers has been realized. The process involves the Eglinton coupling of alkyne&#8208;substituted ruthenium complexes, allowing selective oligomer formation. NMR and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm annulene&#8216;s influence on chromophores. The resulting oligomers demonstrate increased absorption coefficients in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, providing an efficient strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.







Abstract
The appropriate arrangement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chromophores allows for the modification of the peak wavelength in the NIR region and efficient use of NIR light. However, the preparation of novel NIR chromophores using simple procedures remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers. The metal complexes can be synthesized in a single step and interact strongly with NIR light. Alkyne&#8208;substituted low&#8208;symmetry ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complexes were synthesized and subjected to Eglinton coupling to obtain dehydro[12] and [18]annulene&#8208;fused dimers and trimers. Fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction conditions led to the selective synthesis of the target oligomers. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic and 12&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic properties of the annulene influenced the ruthenium complex chromophore, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy showed changes in the electronic structure of their excited state owing to molecular&#8208;symmetry differences. The absorption coefficient in the NIR region of the absorption spectra of the oligomers increased significantly, supporting the efficient use of light by oligomerization. The formation of oligomers using ball&#8208;shaped metal complexes is a simple and effective strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present the solid&#8208;state structures of solvent&#8208;free Ga[pf] and In[pf] salts ([pf]&#8211; = [Al(ORF)4]&#8211;; RF = C(CF3)3), which are very rare examples of salts with truly &#8216;naked&#8217; metal cations. Both salts may serve as starting materials for subvalent gallium and indium chemistry with very weakly coordinating ligands providing the freedom of choice for solvents and ligands for the future. On the other hand, we report and rationalize the formation and isolation of [M(OEt2)2][pf] and [M(MeCN)2][pf] (M&#160;= Ga, In), underlining the surprising stability of these subvalent group 13 M+ ions against disproportionation. Unexpectedly, tricoordinate and carbene analogous [Ga(L)2]+ ions with the [pf]&#8211; counterion are stable in L = acetonitrile and diethyl ether at room temperature, opening up possible applications for example in organic synthesis and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Stability and Kinetic Inertness of Mn(II) Complexes by Increasing the Bridge Length in Bicyclic CDTA&#8208;like Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Chemoselective Post&#8208;Synthesis Modification of Pyridyl&#8208;Substituted, Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Cationic Ligands for Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triazaphospholes are potential polydentate ligands due to the presence of both phosphorus and nitrogen donor atoms within the aromatic 5&#8208;membered heterocycle. The incorporation of an additional pyridyl&#8208;substituent opens up the possibility of a post&#8208;synthesis modification via chemoselective and also stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms. This can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the electrophile and allows the targeted synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and dicationic ligands. Reaction with Cu(I)&#8208;halides causes the formation of cuprates of the type [CuXn](n&#8208;1)&#8208;, which enables coordination of the &#960;&#8208;acidic phosphorus donor to the negatively charged metal core, which is favored over the coordination by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating nitrogen atom. The use of cationic triazaphosphole derivatives can be used as a strategy to enforce the coordination of the ligand to an electron rich metal solely via the phosphorus atom. However, there is a subtle balance between the formation of either coordination polymers or dimeric structures, as the substitution pattern on the heterocycle and the nature of the halide have a large influence on the coordination motifs formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Composition and Conformation of Hetero&#8208; versus Homo&#8208;Fluorinated Triazolamers Influence their Activity on Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While fluorinated molecules constitute nearly 30&#8201;% of all newly approved drugs, and peptidomimetic foldamers provide original solutions to resolve certain peptide problems, the interest of fluorinated foldamers is still little addressed. The conformational and biological interest of fluorinated triazolamers as an alternative to natural peptides is demonstrated here.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated foldamers based on aminomethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;difluoroacetic acid (1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2) units were synthesized and their conformational behaviour was studied by NMR and molecular dynamics. Their activity on the aggregation of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) amyloid protein was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The fluorine labelling of these foldamers allowed the analysis of their interaction with the target protein. We demonstrated that the preferred extended conformation of homotriazolamers of 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 unit increases the aggregation of hIAPP, while the hairpin&#8208;like conformation of more flexible heterotriazolamers containing two 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units mixed with natural amino acids from the hIAPP sequence reduces it, and more efficiently than the parent natural peptide. The longer heterotriazolamers having three 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units adopting more folded hairpin&#8208;like and ladder&#8208;like structures similar to short multi&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheets have no effect. This work demonstrates that a good balance between the structuring and flexibility of these foldamers is necessary to allow efficient interaction with the target protein.

         <title>Breaking the Rules: On the Relative Stability of Some Methylencyclopropane and Methylcyclopropene Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In or out? Contrarily to the well&#8208;established tendency of 1&#8208;methylcyclopropene compounds to isomerize to the corresponding methylenecyclopropanes, the spiro&#8208;derivative MeCP is refractory towards its conversion into MCP. The reasons of this unexpected behavior were unraveled by high&#8208;level computations, which showed that in the case under exam the endocyclic C&#8722;C double bond isomer is more stable than the exocyclic one by around 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The structure of the spirocyclic product obtained by reacting catechol with 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;(chloromethyl)cyclopropane is shown by NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis to be that of a 2&#8208;methylcyclopropene (MeCP), instead of the previously reported 2&#8208;methylenecyclopropane (MCP) one. The study of the equilibration between the two isomeric forms by experimental and computational means (including both Density Functional Theory &#8211; DFT &#8211; and Coupled Cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations &#8211; CCSD(T) &#8211; calculations) revealed that, at variance with most of the alkylidenecyclopropane/alkylcyclopropene systems described to date, for the compounds of the present study the MeCP derivative is more stable by&#8776; 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 than the MCP one. The extension of the DFT and CCSD(T) study to other spiro&#8208;MCP/MeCP pairs suggests that the origin of the unexpected shift of the equilibrium position can be tracked back to a combination of electronic and ring&#8208;strain effects. These findings lead to re&#8208;think a long&#8208;standing, and substantially undisputed belief in the area of unsaturated cyclopropane derivatives.

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Ukrainian diazoalkane train&#8221; arrives at Kyiv station where a new representative of the diazoalkane family is waiting to board. Over the last two decades, several diazoalkanes relevant to medicinal chemistry have been studied extensively by Ukrainian chemists. Now, the synthesis and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide (Me&#8322;P(O)CHN&#8322;), a novel diazoalkane reagent, are described for the first time. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O. Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303972). Artwork by Vitalii Boklashchuk.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click chemistry&#160;has reached its maturity as the weapon of choice for the irreversible ligation of molecular fragments, with over 20 years of research resulting in the development or improvement of highly efficient kinetically controlled conjugation reactions. Nevertheless, traditional click reactions can be disadvantageous not only in terms of efficiency (side products, slow kinetics, air/water tolerance, etc.), but also because they completely avoid the possibility to reversibly produce and control bound/unbound states. Recently,&#160;non&#8208;covalent click chemistry&#160;has appeared as a more efficient alternative, in particular by using host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembled systems of high thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. This review discusses the implementation of molecular switches in the development of such non&#8208;covalent ligation processes, resulting in what we have termed&#160;stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry, in which the bound/unbound constitutional states of the system can be favored by external stimulation, in particular using host&#8208;guest&#160;complexes. As we exemplify with handpicked selected examples, these supramolecular systems are well suited for the development of human&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, by coupling thermodynamically regulated processes with appropriate temporally resolved extrinsic control mechanisms, thus mimicking nature and advancing our efforts to develop a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear, Planar, Orbicular, and Macrocyclic Multinuclear Zinc (Meth)acrylate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc carboxylate complexes are widely utilized as artificial models of metalloenzymes and as secondary building units of PCPs/MOFs. However, the relationship between the structure of the monodentate carboxylato ligand and the molecular arrangement of multinuclear zinc carboxylate complexes is not fully understood because of the coordination flexibility of the Zn ion and carboxylato ligands. Herein, we report the structural analysis of a series of complexes derived from zinc (meth)acrylate which has a linear infinite chain structure. The molecular structure of &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complexes [Zn4(&#956;4&#8208;O)(OCOR)6] revealed a distorted Zn4O core. Crystallization of zinc acrylate under aqueous conditions afforded a &#956;3&#8208;hydroxido&#8208;containing pentanuclear complex [Zn5(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(OCOR)8] as the repeating unit of an infinite sheet&#8208;like structure in the solid state. It was also obtained by the hydrolysis of the &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complex. In sharp contrast, the methacrylate analog retained the methacrylato ligands under aqueous crystallization conditions to form a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex with methacrylato as the sole ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorination Strategy and Low&#8208;Acidity Anchoring Group in Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we synthesized two donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type small organic molecules with self&#8208;assembly properties, namely MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA and MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA, both containing a low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid. After systematically investigation, it is found that, with the fluorination, the MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA demonstrates a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, higher hole mobility, higher hydrophobicity and stronger interaction with the perovskite layer than that of MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA. As a result, the device based&#8208;on MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA displays a better crystallization and morphology of perovskite layer with larger grain size and less non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the device using MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA as hole transport material achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.32% and remarkable stability. After being kept in an N2 glove box for 116 days, the unsealed PSCs&#8217; device retained 93% of its initial PCE. Even exposed to air with a relative humidity range of 30&#177;5% for 43 days, its PCE remained above 91% of its initial condition. This study highlights the vital importance of the fluorination strategy combined with a low acidity anchoring group in SAMs, offering a pathway to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Azetidine&#8208;Containing Small Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) into peptide backbones improves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclizations compared to unmodified peptides. The azetidine nitrogen can be readily functionalized using substitution or click chemistry. Crystal structure analysis reveals that a 3&#8208;AAz modified cyclic tetrapeptide adopts an uncommon all&#8208;trans conformation. The 3&#8208;AAz provides stability to protease degradation compared to the unmodified macrocycle.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are increasingly important structures in drugs but their development can be impeded by difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here, we introduce the 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) subunit as a new turn&#8208;inducing element for the efficient synthesis of small head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclic peptides. Greatly improved cyclizations of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexapeptides (28 examples) under standard reaction conditions are achieved by introduction of this element within the linear peptide precursor. Post&#8208;cyclization deprotection of the amino acid side chains with strong acid is realized without degradation of the strained four&#8208;membered azetidine. A special feature of this chemistry is that further late&#8208;stage modification of the resultant macrocyclic peptides can be achieved via the 3&#8208;AAz unit. This is done by: (i) chemoselective deprotection and substitution at the azetidine nitrogen, or by (ii) a click&#8208;based approach employing a 2&#8208;propynyl carbamate on the azetidine nitrogen. In this way, a range of dye and biotin tagged macrocycles are readily produced. Structural insights gained by XRD analysis of a cyclic tetrapeptide indicate that the azetidine ring encourages access to the less stable, all&#8208;trans conformation. Moreover, introduction of a 3&#8208;AAz into a representative cyclohexapeptide improves stability towards proteases compared to the homodetic macrocycle.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Topological Switch Based on a DNA Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformation of a quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrid interconverts between antiparallel and (3+1) hybrid topologies as a function of pH. This topological transition is associated with adenine protonation to form a capping structure in a slightly acidic environment and may be used as a pH&#8208;sensitive DNA nanoswitch.







Abstract
A guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotide based on a human telomeric sequence but with the first three&#8208;nucleotide intervening stretch replaced by a putative 15&#8208;nucleotide hairpin&#8208;forming sequence shows a pH&#8208;dependent folding into different quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrids in a potassium containing buffer. At slightly acidic pH, the quadruplex domain adopts a chair&#8208;type conformation. Upon increasing the pH, a transition with a midpoint close to neutral pH to a major and minor (3+1) hybrid topology with either a coaxially stacked or orthogonally oriented duplex stem&#8208;loop occurs. NMR&#8208;derived high&#8208;resolution structures reveal that an adenine protonation is prerequisite for the formation of a non&#8208;canonical base quartet, capping the outer G&#8208;tetrad at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface and stabilizing the antiparallel chair conformation in an acidic environment. Being directly associated with interactions at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface, this unique pH&#8208;dependent topological transition is fully reversible. Coupled with a conformation&#8208;sensitive optical readout demonstrated as a proof of concept using the fluorescent dye thiazole orange, the present quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrid architecture represents a potentially valuable pH&#8208;sensing system responsive in a physiological pH range of 7&#177;1.

This topological transition is associated with adenine protonation to form a capping structure in a slightly acidic environment and may be used as a pH-sensitive DNA nanoswitch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guanine-rich oligonucleotide based on a human telomeric sequence but with the first three-nucleotide intervening stretch replaced by a putative 15-nucleotide hairpin-forming sequence shows a pH-dependent folding into different quadruplex-duplex hybrids in a potassium containing buffer. At slightly acidic pH, the quadruplex domain adopts a chair-type conformation. Upon increasing the pH, a transition with a midpoint close to neutral pH to a major and minor (3+1) hybrid topology with either a coaxially stacked or orthogonally oriented duplex stem-loop occurs. NMR-derived high-resolution structures reveal that an adenine protonation is prerequisite for the formation of a non-canonical base quartet, capping the outer G-tetrad at the quadruplex-duplex interface and stabilizing the antiparallel chair conformation in an acidic environment. Being directly associated with interactions at the quadruplex-duplex interface, this unique pH-dependent topological transition is fully reversible. Coupled with a conformation-sensitive optical readout demonstrated as a proof of concept using the fluorescent dye thiazole orange, the present quadruplex-duplex hybrid architecture represents a potentially valuable pH-sensing system responsive in a physiological pH range of 7&#177;1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Asymmetric Control of Orientational Chirality by Using the Combination of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) Levers and Achiral N&#8208;Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We report herein the design of the asymmetric synthesis of orientational atropisomers via Sonogashira coupling as the key step. This new category of orientational atropisomers is anticipated to have a broad impact on chemical, biomedical, and material sciences in the future.







Abstract
New chiral targets of orientational chirality have been designed and asymmetrically synthesized by taking advantage of N&#8208;sulfinyl imine&#8208;directed nucleophilic addition/oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Orientation of single isomers has been selectively controlled by using aryl/alkynyl levers [C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) axis] and tBuSO2&#8208; protecting group on nitrogen as proven by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The key structural characteristic of resulting orientational products is shown by remote through&#8208;space blocking manner. Seventeen examples of multi&#8208;step synthesis were obtained with modest to good chemical yields and complete orientational selectivity.

         <title>Recognition of Amino Acid Salts by Temperature&#8208;Dependent Allosteric Binding with Stereodynamic Urea Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites have been developed to transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first guest binding to axial chirality. VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding with amino acid salts showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects leading to the successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acids.







Abstract
Positive homotropic artificial allosteric systems are important for the regulation of cooperativity, selectivity and nonlinear amplification. Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors can transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first ligand binding to axial chirality between two chromophores. We herein report stereodynamic allosteric urea receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites. NMR titration experiments revealed that the receptor can bind two carboxylate guests in a positive homotropic allosteric manner attributed to the inactivation by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between urea units within the receptor. In addition, the VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding of the urea receptor with l&#8208; or D&#8208;amino acid salts in MeCN showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects, based on the differences of the receptor shaft unit and the guest structure. The successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acid salts indicated that the input of chiral and steric information for the guest was amplified as outputs of the Cotton effect and the temperature&#8208;dependence of VT&#8208;CD spectra through cooperativity of positive allosteric binding.

         <title>Optimal Oriented External Electric Fields to Trigger a Barrierless Oxaphosphetane Ring Opening Step of the Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perturbed potential energy surface of the oxaphosphetane ring opening due to the optimal electric field demonstrates that the process occurs by first breaking the P&#8722;C bond and then breaking the O&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is one of the most important processes in organic chemistry for the asymmetric synthesis of olefinic compounds. In view of the increasingly acknowledged potentiality of the electric fields in promoting reactions, here we will consider the effect of the oriented external electric field (OEEF) on the second step of Wittig reaction (i.&#8201;e. the ring opening oxaphosphetane) in a model system for non&#8208;stabilized ylides. In particular, we have determined the optimal direction and strength of the electric field that should be applied to annihilate the reaction barrier of the ring opening through the polarizable molecular electric dipole (PMED) model that we have recently developed. We conclude that the application of the optimal external electric field for the oxaphosphetane ring opening favours a Bestmann&#8208;like mechanism.

         <title>Cyclopropanation of Alkenes with Halodiazirines as Halocarbene Precursors in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of substituted 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes through the reaction of alkenes with photolytically&#8208;generated chlorocarbenes from chlorodiazirines is reported as an effective method. This approach facilitates the production of diverse 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes (32 examples) in an continuous flow with a residence time of 5 minutes under the influence of light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation. The use of 380&#8197;nm irradiation conditions was effectively extended to the synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes (3 examples).

This practical and efficient approach allows the synthesis of various 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes (32 examples) in continuous flow in 5&#8208;minute residence time under light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation. The conditions using 380&#8197;nm LED irradiation were successfully extended to the synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes (3 examples).

     alt="Cyclopropanation of Alkenes with Halodiazirines as Halocarbene Precursors in Continuous Flow"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation of substituted 3-chloro-3-aryl-cyclopropanes through the reaction of alkenes with photolytically-generated chlorocarbenes from chlorodiazirines is reported as an effective method. This approach facilitates the production of diverse 3-chloro-3-aryl-cyclopropanes (32 examples) in an continuous flow with a residence time of 5 minutes under the influence of light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation. The use of 380&#8197;nm irradiation conditions was effectively extended to the synthesis of substituted 3-bromo-3-aryl-cyclopropanes (3 examples).

Abstract
A new noncentrosymmetric strontium borate, P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (1), has been synthesized under the hydrothermal condition. The P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O shows a layered B&#8722;O network with 9&#8208;ring windows in the ab plane. Sr2+ cations, H3BO3, and H2O molecules are located in the voids of layers and interlayers, respectively. The P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O is the first synthetic phase of veatchite, while the other three polymorphs are found in different natural minerals. This strontium borate is a potential deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#8208;transparent nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) crystal whose second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) intensity is 1.7 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) and is phase&#8208;matchable. The short wavelength cutoff edge of compound 1 is below 190&#8197;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the B&#8722;O units are responsible for the nonlinear optical property.

         <title>20&#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Benziphthalocyanines with Absorption Reaching the Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
20&#960;&#8208;Electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines, low symmetry analogues of phthalocyanine, were synthesized by hydrogenation of 18&#960;&#8208;electron benziphthalocyanines. They exhibit intense absorption in the near&#8208;IR (NIR) region despite their antiaromaticity, which is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition as a result of symmetry&#8208;lowering. Further structural modification extends the absorption into the second NIR region (reaching 1100&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Although second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) light has attracted considerable attention, especially for life sciences applications, the development of organic dyes with NIR&#8208;II absorption remains a formidable challenge. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and electronic properties of 20&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines (BPcs) that exhibit intense absorption bands in the NIR region. The strong, low&#8208;energy absorption of the antiaromatic BPcs is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transitions with narrow band gaps, enabled by the reduced structural symmetry of BPc compared with regular porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The combination of peripheral substituents and a central metal decreases the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the extension of the absorption bands into the NIR&#8208;II region (reaching 1100&#8197;nm) under reductive conditions.

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Metallogels: Drug Loading and Eu(III) as Structural Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular metallogels combine the rheological properties of gels with the color, magnetism, and other properties of metal ions. Lanthanide ions such as Eu(III) can be valuable components of metallogels due to their fascinating luminescence. In this work, we combine Eu(III) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) into luminescent hydrogels. We investigate the tailoring of the rheological properties of these gels by changes in their metal:ligand ratio. Further, we use the highly sensitive Eu(III) luminescence to obtain information about the chemical structure of the materials. In special, we take advantage of computational calculations to employ an indirect method for structural elucidation, in which the simulated luminescent properties of candidate structures are matched to the experimental data. With this strategy, we can propose molecular structures for different EuIDA gels. We also explore the usage of these gels for the loading of bioactive molecules such as OXA, observing that its aldose reductase activity remains present in the gel. We envision that the findings from this work could inspire the development of luminescent hydrogels with tunable rheology for applications such as 3D printing and imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery platforms. Finally, Eu(III) emission&#8208;based structural elucidation could be a powerful tool in the characterization of advanced materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular metallogels combine the rheological properties of gels with the color, magnetism, and other properties of metal ions. Lanthanide ions such as Eu(III) can be valuable components of metallogels due to their fascinating luminescence. In this work, we combine Eu(III) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) into luminescent hydrogels. We investigate the tailoring of the rheological properties of these gels by changes in their metal:ligand ratio. Further, we use the highly sensitive Eu(III) luminescence to obtain information about the chemical structure of the materials. In special, we take advantage of computational calculations to employ an indirect method for structural elucidation, in which the simulated luminescent properties of candidate structures are matched to the experimental data. With this strategy, we can propose molecular structures for different EuIDA gels. We also explore the usage of these gels for the loading of bioactive molecules such as OXA, observing that its aldose reductase activity remains present in the gel. We envision that the findings from this work could inspire the development of luminescent hydrogels with tunable rheology for applications such as 3D printing and imaging-guided drug delivery platforms. Finally, Eu(III) emission-based structural elucidation could be a powerful tool in the characterization of advanced materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Thermally Durable Luminescence of 1D Eu3+ Coordination Polymers with Arsenic Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, bisarsine oxides were evaluated as novel bridging ligands, aiming to develop practical and efficient luminescent lanthanide coordination polymers. We have synthesized one&#8208;dimensional (1D) Eu3+ coordination polymers that incorporate bisarsine oxide bridging ligands and hexafluoroacetylacetonate anions. These polymers exhibited a denser packing of chains compared to analogous polymers bridged with bisphosphine oxides. The coordination polymers demonstrated exceptional thermal stability and substantial emission quantum yields. Additionally, the bisarsine oxides induced a pronounced polarization effect, facilitating a sensitive electric dipole transition that yields considerably narrow band red emission. Remarkably, the Eu3+ coordination polymers with bisarsine oxides maintained intense emission even at 550 K. A distinctive feature of these polymers is their heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement observed when the temperature was increased from 300 K to 400 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nanoparticles to Perform Reactions in Suspension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr2 either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]). [LiBP]&#8208;driven reduction results in smaller Mg(0) nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#160;nm) than [LiNaph]&#8208;driven reduction (28.5&#177;4&#160;nm). The as&#8208;prepared Mg(0) nanoparticles are monocrystalline (d101&#160;=&#160;245&#177;5&#160;pm) for both types of reduction. Their reactivity is probed by liquid&#8208;phase reaction (THF, toluene) in suspension near room temperature (20&#8208;120&#160;&#176;C) with 1&#8208;bromoadamantane (AdBr), chlortriphenylsilane (Ph3SiCl), trichlorphenylsilane (PhSiCl3), 9H&#8208;carbazole (Hcbz), 7&#8208;azaindole (Hai), 1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene (H4nda) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(&#945;&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (H4tpda) as exemplary starting materials. The reactions result in the formation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biadamantane (1), [MgCl2(thf)2]&#215;Ph6Si2 (2), [Mg9(thf)14Cl18] (3), [Mg(cbz)2(thf)3] (4), [Mg4O(ai)6]&#215;1.5&#160;C7H8 (5), [Mg4(H2nda)4(thf)4] (6) and [Mg3(tpda)3] (7) with 40&#8208;80&#160;% yield. 1 and 2 show the reactivity of Mg(0) nanoparticles for C&#8211;C and Si&#8211;Si coupling reactions with sterically demanding starting materials. 3&#8208;7 represent new coordination compounds using sterically demanding N&#8211;H&#8208;acidic amines as starting materials. The formation of multinuclear Mg2+ complexes with multidentate ligands illustrates the potential of the oxidative approach to obtain novel compounds with Mg(0) nanoparticles in the liquid phase.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inclusion of a heteroatom to the phosphole ring is a promising strategy to intrinsically modulate the optical properties of phosphole derivatives. We report on a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides that were efficiently prepared via sequential C&#8211;P cross&#8208;coupling, dehydrative [3 + 2] cycloaddition, and ring&#8208;oxidation reactions. The inclusion of one nitrogen atom into the benzophosphole framework caused red shifting of the absorption and emission maxima, reflecting the greater stabilization of the LUMO level.&#160;2&#8208;(2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzazaphosphole oxide underwent excited state intramolecular proton transfer and emitted a weak fluorescence from the excited state of the N&#8211;H tautomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Benzo&#8208;Annelation on Triplet State Energies in Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We established a quantitative model of the relationship between the structure of conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons and their triplet state excitation energies E(T1). The proposed model can accurately predict the E(T1) with an average absolute error of less than 0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
In a series of earlier studies, the effect of benzo&#8208;annelation was found to be a useful tool for tuning the aromaticity in polycyclic conjugated compounds to desired level. In this work we studied the (anti)aromaticity of benzo&#8208;annelated derivatives of three conjugated hydrocarbons (anthracene, fluoranthene and biphenylene) in their lowest lying singlet (S0) and triplet (T1) states by means of the energy effect (ef), harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), multicentre delocalization indices (MCI), magnetically induced current densities (MICDs) and nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS). We showed that benzo&#8208;annelation is a topology&#8208;based effect which can be used to modify the T1 state excitation energies (E(T1)). A quantitative model was established being able to accurately predict the E(T1) based only on the numbers of angularly, linearly and geminally annelated benzene rings. In addition, it was demonstrated that the E(T1) can be directly related to the (anti)aromatic character of the central ring in the studied molecules in their S0 state.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Discrete Europium(II) Hydride Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyping up Europium: Here we report the first examples of molecular europium&#8197;(II) hydrides, which can be conveniently isolated from the reaction of either symmetrical or unsymmetrical &#946;&#8208;diketiminato europium&#8197;(II) alkyls with 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene.







Abstract
The bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand frameworks [BDIDCHP]&#8722; and [BDIDipp/Ar]&#8722; (BDI=[HC{C(Me)2N&#8208;Dipp/Ar}2]&#8722; (Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dipp); Ar=2,6&#8208;dicyclohexylphyenyl (DCHP) or 2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylphyenyl (TCHP)) have been developed for the kinetic stabilisation of the first europium&#8197;(II) hydride complexes, [(BDIDCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2, [(BDIDipp/DCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 and [(BDIDipp/TCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2, respectively. These complexes represent the first step beyond the current lanthanide(II) hydrides that are all based on ytterbium. Tuning the steric profile of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands from a symmetrical to unsymmetrical disposition, enhanced solubility and stability in the solution&#8211;state. This provides the first opportunity to study the structure and bonding of these novel Eu(II) hydride complexes crystallographically, spectroscopically and computationally, with their preliminary reactivity investigated.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Complexation with Fe(0) of a Tight&#8208;bite Bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the unique reactions of a tight&#8208;bite bis(NHSi) with p&#8208;toluidine and Fe(CO)5. With p&#8208;toluidine, it resulted in the oxidative addition of both N&#8722;H bonds across two Si(II) atoms to afford cyclodisilazane, whereas with Fe(CO)5 a four&#8208;membered NSi2Fe2 ring with a Fe&#8722;Fe bond of 2.6892(13) &#197; is formed.







Abstract
The synthesis, reactivity, and complexation with Fe(0) precursor of a tight&#8208;bite bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) (bis(NHSi)) ligand 1 are reported. The reaction of 1 with p&#8208;toluidine led to the activation of both N&#8722;H bonds across Si(II) atoms to afford a four&#8208;membered heterocyclic cyclodisilazane 2, with hydride substituents attached to five&#8208;coordinate Si atoms. A 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 reaction of 1 with Fe(CO)5 led to an intriguing dinuclear complex 3 featuring a five&#8208;membered (N&#8722;Si&#8722;Fe&#8722;Fe&#8722;Si) ring with a Fe&#8722;Fe bond distance of 2.6892(13) &#197;. All compounds (1&#8208;3) were thoroughly characterized by various spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies conclusively established their molecular structures. DFT calculations were carried out to shed light on bonding and energetic aspects in 1&#8211;3.

         <title>Unrevealing the Nitrogen Elusive Chirality of 3&#8208;Sulfanyl and 3&#8208;Sulfinyl N&#8208;Tosyl Isoindolinones by ECD Spectra: an Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>

         <dc:description>
A combined theoretical&#8211;experimental strategy revealed the chiral, configurationally stable nature of solvated tricoordinate N&#8208;lactams of the title compounds, offering reliable insights into their chiroptical properties.







Abstract
The nitrogen&#8211;hybridization/pyramidalization of two solvated N&#8208;tosylisoindolinone derivatives having chiral residues in adjacent&#8197;(I) or adjacent and distal (II) position has been investigated by a theoretical&#8208;computational procedure based on Molecular Dynamics simulations and Quantum&#8211;Chemical calculations. After validation of our methodology in providing a reliable repertory of conformations by modeling the electronic circular dichroism (EDC) spectra, the electronic features associated with N&#8208;pyramidalization were further characterized through Natural Bond Order (NBO) analysis. Comparing against the N&#8208;geometry observed in crystal structures as a reference, our findings reveal that the presence of neighbouring chiral centers induces a more pronounced N&#8208;pyramidalization in solution than in the solid state, both in I and II. Furthermore, NBO analysis confirms that the N&#8208;lactam mostly retains the sp2 character but exhibits slight configurational distortion (&#958;I=13&#176;; &#958;II=21&#176;), which significantly influences the chiroptical activities observed in ECD spectra of I and II. This substantiates the N&#8208;lactams as configurationally stable chiral centers.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Selective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes from Alkenes and Formaldehyde Catalyzed by Dimethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a selective and metal&#8208;free pathway to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from cheap alkenes and formaldehyde. The reaction occurs at 30&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and only releases water as a by&#8208;product. Through a combined theoretical&#8208;experimental study, we discovered that this reaction could be advantageously catalyzed by dimethylamine.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated aldehydes are important building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers. The synthesis of these molecules from cheap feedstocks such as alkenes remains a scientific challenge, mainly due to the low reactivity of alkenes. Here we report a selective and metal&#8208;free access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes with formaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by dimethylamine and affords &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in yields of up to 80&#8201;%.

     alt="Metal-Free Selective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Aldehydes from Alkenes and Formaldehyde Catalyzed by Dimethylamine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report here a selective and metal-free pathway to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes from cheap alkenes and formaldehyde. The reaction occurs at 30&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and only releases water as a by-product. Through a combined theoretical-experimental study, we discovered that this reaction could be advantageously catalyzed by dimethylamine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated aldehydes are important building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers. The synthesis of these molecules from cheap feedstocks such as alkenes remains a scientific challenge, mainly due to the low reactivity of alkenes. Here we report a selective and metal-free access to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes with formaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by dimethylamine and affords &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes in yields of up to 80&#8201;%. By combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, we elucidate the reaction mechanism which is based on a cascade of hydride transfer, hydrolysis and aldolization reactions. The reaction can be performed under very mild conditions (30&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C), in a theoretically 100&#8201;% carbon-economical fashion, with water as the only by-product. The reaction was successfully applied to non-activated linear 1-alkenes, thus opening an access to industrially relevant &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes from cheap and widely abundant chemicals at large scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;coupling between Aryl Halides and&#160;Aryl Alkynes Catalyzed by an Odd Alternant Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes is considered an extremely important organic transformation (popularly known as the Sonogashira coupling) and it requires a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst. Accomplishing such transformation without any transition metal&#8208;based catalyst in the absence of any external stimuli such as heat, photoexcitation or cathodic current is extremely challenging.&#160;&#160;This work reports transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. A chemically double&#8208;reduced phenalenyl (PLY)&#8208;based molecule with the super&#8208;reducing property was employed for single electron transfer to activate aryl halides generating reactive aryl radicals, which subsequently react with alkyne. This protocol covers not only various types of aryl, heteroaryl and polyaryl halides but also applies to a large variety of aromatic alkynes at room temperature. With a versatile substrate scope successfully tested on more than 75 entries, this radical&#8208;mediated pathway has been explained by several control experiments. All the key reactive intermediates have been characterized with spectroscopic evidence. Detailed DFT calculations have been instrumental in portraying the mechanistic pathway. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic strategy for the first time towards solvent&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between solid aryl halide and alkyne substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for using Quaternary Ammonium Salts as Alternative Reagents in Alkylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylation reactions are pivotal in organic chemistry, with wide&#8208;ranging utilization across various fields of applied synthetic chemistry. However, conventional reagents employed in alkylations often pose substantial health and exposure risks. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) present a promising alternative for these transformations offering significantly reduced hazards as they are non&#8208;cancerogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive. Despite their potential, their use in direct organic transformations remains relatively unexplored. This review outlines strategies for utilizing QAS as alternative reagents in alkylation reactions, providing researchers with safer approaches to chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Lattice Defects on trans&#8208;Oligoene Substructure Formation in Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemical reaction of iodine and graphene induces strong new Raman modes due to the formation of trans&#8208;oligoene substructures in graphene domains. This unique reactivity was demonstrated before on defect&#8208;free graphene, however leaving the influence of e.g. carbon vacancies, unexplored. Here, we investigate the photochemical reaction applied on graphene with varying average distances of lattice defects and statistically analyze the characteristic Raman modes which develop with the iodination reaction. We show that the iodination reaction does not lead to Raman&#8208;active defects and thus, the newly formed trans&#8208;oligoene substructures do not contribute to the D&#8208;mode of graphene. A statistical analysis reveals the correlation between the average distance of lattice defects and the intensity of the v1&#8208;mode. For defective graphene with average defect distances below ~1 nm no new Raman modes evolve, which is the lower limit of the substructure size probed at 532 nm and explains why this observation was not possible before using common graphene oxide as graphene source.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design and Synthesis of Lipid A Derivatives to Modulate Cytokine Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Agonists of Toll like receptors (TLRs) have attracted interest as adjuvants and immune modulators. A crystal structure of TLR4/MD2 with E. coli LPS indicates that the fatty acid at C&#8208;2 of the lipid A component of LPS induces dimerization of two TLR4&#8208;MD2 complexes, which in turn initiates cell signaling leading to the production of (pro)inflammatory cytokines. To probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of lipid A, a range of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;phosphoryl lipid A derivatives with different modifications at C&#8208;2 were prepared by a strategy in which 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl ethers were employed as permanent protecting group that could be readily removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The C&#8208;2 amine was protected as 9&#8208;fluorenylmethyloxycarbamate, which at a later stage could be removed to give a free amine that was modified by different fatty acids. LPS and the synthetic lipid As induced the same cytokines, however, large differences in activity were observed. A compound having a hexanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 still showed agonistic properties, but further shortening to a butanoyl abolished activity. The modifications had a larger influence on monophosphoryl lipid As. The lipid As having a butanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 could selectively antagonize TRIF associated cytokines induced by LPS or lipid A.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A de novo asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester precursor is described. Key transformations used in the stereodivergent approach include two Noyori asymmetric reductions, an Achmatowicz rearrangement, diastereoselective alkene oxidations, and the first example of a palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of a vinylogous pyranone. The isomeric composition of the bicyclic reducing sugars obtained was analyzed and their behaviour was compared to the natural product, revealing key stereocentres that impact the overall distribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Reichardt&#8217;s Dye &#8211; Synthesis and Solvatochromic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes based on the benchmark solvatochromic dye Betaine 30 were synthesised. The dyes contained phenylene spacers between the donor and acceptor groups. Their UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra were measured, with the dyes showing strong negative solvatochromic behaviour comparable to that of Betaine 30. These results stood in contrast to the behaviour of the &#960;&#8208;extended dye Betaine 21, originally reported in 1963. This dye was synthesised and found to be significantly more solvatochromic than previously reported but prone to degrade. All &#960;&#8208;extended dyes synthesised were found to be unstable in certain solvents. Although the increased distance between donor and acceptor did not enhance solvatochromism to the extent predicted, it was still determined that the reduced planarity caused by a phenylene spacer is not as detrimental as believed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine(III) Mediated Halogen Bonded Supramolecular Chiral System with Cholesteryl Naphthalimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial &#963;&#8208;holes as halogen&#8208;bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side&#8208;arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self&#8208;aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod&#8208;like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Supramolecular Polymers and Covalent Polymers via the Same Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature owns the ability to construct structurally different polymers from the same monomers. While polymers can be classified as covalent polymers (CPs) and supramolecular polymers (SPs), it is still difficult to synthesize CPs and SPs using same monomers like nature do. Herein, M1 with two diazo salts on both the ends was designed. Additionally, hydroquinone was chosen to be M2 for the existence of two hydroxyl groups. When mixing at room temperature, M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled to SPs via N&#8230;H hydrogen bonds. In another way, upon the exposure to ultraviolet irradiation when blending M1 with M2, CPs were fabricated in the presence of covalent bonds. The excellent thermal stability of CPs was determined by TGA and DSC, while the great corrosion resistance of covalent polymers was detected by acid or alkali immersion. In this way, constructing two kinds of polymers using the same monomers was successfully achieved. This shows tremendous potential in fields of polymer science, supramolecular chemistry, which would boom the development of polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Trapping of an Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Dynamic Library of Imines by Changing Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A well&#8208;behaved dynamic library composed of two imines and corresponding amines was subjected to the action of an activated carboxylic acid (ACA), whose decarboxylation is known to be base promoted, in different solvents, namely CD2Cl2, CD3CN, and mixtures of them. Two non&#8209;equilibrium systems are consequently obtained: i) a dissipative (CD2Cl2) and ii) an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium (CD3CN) dynamic library whose composition goes back to equilibrium after a given time. In the former case, the library is fully coupled with the decarboxylation of the ACA, while in the latter, an energy ratchet operates. In the mixed solvents, the library exhibits a mediated behavior. Interestingly, Interestingly, in the presence of an excess of added ACA, the different behavior of the imine library in the two solvents is expected to manifest only when the excess acid is consumed</dc:description>

         <title>Indole C5&#8208;Selective Bromination of Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine Alkaloids via In Situ&#8208;Generated Indoline Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are many indole alkaloids that contain diverse functional groups attached to the benzene ring on the indole core. Promising biological activities of these alkaloids have been reported. Herein, we report the indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#183;PyH and HCl in MeOH. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. Data support the intermediacy of a C3&#8208;, C5&#8208;dibrominated indolenine intermediate as a brominating agent. These conditions demonstrate excellent selectivity for indole C5 bromination of natural products and their derivatives. Thus, these simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions allow for selective, late&#8208;stage bromination followed by further chemical modifications. The utility of the brominated product prepared from naturally occurring yohimbine was demonstrated through various derivatizations, including a bioinspired heterodimerization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thiolate&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid Catalysts for Reduction of CO2: Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Amines to Form Formamides and Methylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient catalysts to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals is valuable for reducing carbon emissions. Herein, a kind of novel thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid&#160;with sulfur as the active site was designed and synthesized, which served as highly efficient catalyst for the reductive functionalization of CO2 by amines and hydrosilane. By adjusting the CO2 pressure, various formamides and methylamines were selectively obtained in high yields. Remarkably, at the catalyst loading of 0.1 mol%, the N&#8208;formylation reaction of N&#8208;methylaniline exhibited an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) up to 600 h&#8208;1. This IL catalyst displayed the highest activity compared to the reported non&#8208;transition&#8208;metal catalysts, which could be attributed to the multiple roles of the IL in activating hydrosilane, amine and CO2. In addition, control experiments and NMR monitoring experiments provided evidence that the reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane yielded formoxysilane intermediates that subsequently reacted with amines to form N&#8208;formylated products. Alternatively, the formoxysilane intermediates could further react with hydrosilane and amine to produce 4&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced aminal products. These aminal products served as crucial intermediates in the N&#8208;methylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Pyrazolium Ylide Reactivity to Access Indolizine and 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, transition metal&#8208;free method to synthesize indolizines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidines from pyrazolium ylides is presented. The reaction of pyrazolium ylides with alkynes follows an N&#8208;deletion mechanism to afford indolizines, while reaction with isocyanates follows a rearrangement into a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidine.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic ylides are important synthetic precursors to rapidly build molecular complexity. Pyrazolium ylides have largely been unexplored, and we demonstrate their diverse utility in this report. We show that these readily accessible building blocks can be used to construct different heterocyclic skeletons by varying the coupling partner. Indolizines can be formed via an N&#8208;deletion type mechanism when reacting pyrazolium salts with electron deficient alkynes. 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidines can be formed via a rearrangement mechanism when reacting pyrazolium ylides with isocyanates. These reactions enable access to valuable heteroarenes without the need for transition metal catalysis, high temperatures, or strong bases.

         <title>Design of New Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane&#8208;Based Nitrogen Ligands: Synthesis and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new alcohol neutral ligand precursors based on bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane moieties is reported. A substrate&#8208;dependent functionalization is observed allowing access to a variety of ligand precursors. The coordination chemistry of some of them against aluminum and zinc have also been investigated.







Abstract
The reaction between bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane derivatives and nBuLi and various aldehydes, yielded novel neutral ligand precursors incorporating alcohol functional groups. The resulting compounds exhibited distinct characteristics depending on the steric hindrance of the aldehyde employed. In instances where aromatic aldehydes were utilized, functionalization occurred at the methine group bridging both triazole rings. Conversely, the use of pivalic aldehyde prompted functionalization at the C5 position of the triazole ring. These compounds were subsequently employed as ligand precursors in the synthesis of organometallic aluminum and zinc complexes, yielding dinuclear complexes with high efficiency. The structural elucidation of all compounds was accomplished through spectroscopic methods and validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Preliminary catalytic investigations into the coupling reaction of cyclohexene oxide and CO2 revealed that aluminum and zinc complexes catalyzed the selective formation of polyether and polycarbonate materials, respectively.

         <title>Amino&#8208; and Alkoxybenziodoxoles: Facile Preparation and Use as Arynophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diverse array of amino&#8208; and alkoxybenziodoxoles can be easily synthesized by reacting the respective amines and alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole. These iodane compounds undergo insertion of arynes into the N&#8722;I(III) and O&#8722;I(III) bonds to give ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, the iodane group of which can be leveraged as a versatile leaving group for downstream transformations.







Abstract
We report here on the facile synthesis of amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes supported by a benziodoxole (BX) template and their use as arynophiles. The amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX derivatives can be readily synthesized by reacting the respective amines or alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole in the presence of a suitable base. Unlike previously known nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;bound iodane compounds, which have primarily been employed as electrophilic group transfer agents or oxidants, the present amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX reagents manifest themselves as nucleophilic amino and alkoxy transfer agents toward arynes. This reactivity leads to the aryne insertion into the N&#8722;I(III) or O&#8722;I(III) bond to afford ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, iodane compounds nontrivial to procure by existing methods. The BX group in these insertion products exhibits excellent leaving group ability, enabling diverse downstream transformations.

A stereoselective intramolecular bicyclization reaction of sulfonamides via intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade which is an efficient, simple and practical method for the synthesis of bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams.







Abstract
A novel approach has been developed for the synthesis of bicyclic &#946;, &#947;&#8208;fused bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams containing two consecutive chiral centers through an intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade of alkenyl sulfamides. The straightforward practical procedure and readily available starting materials enable the synthesis of variously substituted ureasultams. In addition, bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams is a class of potential biotin analogues.

         <title>Endowing Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Materials with Chiroptical Activity by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the chirality transfer from chiral anions to cationic coordination components, efficient circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence properties are realized. Such a chiral anion strategy is successfully implemented in ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The chiroptical properties can be modulated by the use of different chiral anions.







Abstract
Recently, chiral metal&#8208;organic coordination materials have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of applications in chiroptoelectronics, chiral catalysis, and information encryption, etc. Notably, the chiroptical effect of coordination chromophores makes them appealing for applications such as photodetectors, OLEDs, 3D displays, and bioimaging. The direct synthesis of chiral coordination materials using chiral organic ligands or complexes with metal&#8208;centered chirality is very often tedious and costly. In the case of ionic coordination materials, the combination of chiral anions with cationic, achiral coordination compounds through noncovalent interactions may endow molecular materials with desirable chiroptical properties. The use of such a simple chiral strategy has been proven effective in inducing promising circular dichroism and/or circularly polarized luminescence signals. This concept article mainly delves into the latest advances in exploring the efficacy of such a chiral anion strategy for transforming achiral coordination materials into chromophores with superb photo&#8208; or electro&#8208;chiroptical properties. In particular, ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks containing chiral anions are discussed. A perspective on the future opportunities on the preparation of chiroptical materials with the chiral anion strategy is also presented.

         <title>A GFP Inspired 8&#8208;Methoxyquinoline&#8211;Derived Fluorescent Molecular Sensor for the Detection of Zn2+ by Two&#8211;Photon Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New zinc sensor with 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety inspired by the green fluorescent protein chromophore was synthesized and characterized. The in&#8197;vitro validation of the novel probe with two&#8211;photon microscopy was carried out successfully.







Abstract
An effective, GFP&#8208;inspired fluorescent Zn2+ sensor is developed for two&#8211;photon microscopy and related biological application that features an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety. Excellent photophysical characteristics including a 37&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with excitation and emission maxima at 440&#8197;nm and 505&#8197;nm, respectively, as well as a high two&#8211;photon cross&#8211;section of 73&#8197;GM at 880&#8197;nm are reported. Based on the experimental data, the relationship between the structure and properties was elucidated and explained backed up by DFT calculations, particularly the observed PeT phenomenon for the turn&#8211;on process. Biological validation and detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the free and the zinc&#8211;bound compounds are presented.

         <title>Unraveling Polymorphism Dependent Cytotoxicity, Cellular Uptake, and Live Cell Imaging Using Luminescent Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphism&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of drug molecules have been studied for the past two decades. However, visualizing the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using microscopy imaging technique has not been reported yet. The luminescent polymorph is an ideal candidate to validate the above hypothesis. Herein, we report the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and bio&#8208;imaging functions of polymorphs 1Y and 1R of a naphthalimide&#8208;phenothiazine dyad. These polymorphs show different luminescence colors in the solid state and exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in the DMSO&#8208;Water mixture. Bioimaging, cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) studies revealed that these polymorphs show different levels of cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, localization, and imaging potential. Detailed photophysical, morphological, and biological studies revealed that the difference in molecular conformation in these polymorphs enables them to form aggregates of different sizes and morphology, which leads to the differential uptake of these into the cells and consequently shows different cytotoxicity and imaging potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies to Design Chemocatalytic Racemization of Tertiary Alcohols: State of the Art &amp; Utilization for Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this "Concepts"&#8208;article, the difficulties in racemizing tertiary alcohols are described as well as a summary of the different chemocatalytic concepts to overcome these hurdles and to pave a way for efficiently racemizing of tertiary alcohols. When combined with the enantioselective enzymatic esterification of tertiary alcohols, the racemization protocols enable a DKR to convert the racemates into enantiomerically pure esters of tertiary alcohols, which are of high interest in the field of pharmaceutically active products. Very recently, various research groups have succeeded in solving the challenging task of identifying suitable chemocatalysts for an efficient racemization of tertiary alcohols and simultaneously suppressing unwanted dehydration side&#8208;reactions. It is noteworthy that such methods are based on different, complementary catalysis concepts. Besides Br&#248;nsted acids, oxovanadium catalysts as well as piperidine as a representative of an organocatalyst have been found to be useful for the racemization of each type of alcohols. The latter two types of catalysts also turned out to be compatible with lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution, thus leading to the first two examples of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for chemoenzymatic DKR of tertiary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination of a Phosphine&#8208;Tethered Aminoborane to Group 10 Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While &#960;&#8208;complexes of C=C bonds are ubiquitous in organometallic chemistry, analogous complexes of the isoelectronic but strongly polarized B=N double bond of aminoboranes are extremely scarce. To address this gap, a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand (PhDPBAiPr) is introduced and its coordination with group 10 metals is investigated. The B=N bond does not coordinate to the metal in Pt(0) and Pd(II) complexes. In contrast, side&#8208;on coordination of the B=N bond is observed in the Ni(0) complex [PhDPBAiPr]Ni(NCPh), and the X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals B&#8212;N bond elongation compared to the free ligand. The choice of co&#8208;ligand strongly influences the presence or absence of side&#8208;on coordination at Ni(0) as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. While the B=N &#960;&#8208;complex is geometrically similar to C=C analogues, a bonding analysis reveals that the interaction of the B=N motif with the electron&#8208;rich Ni(0) center is best described as 3c4e hyperbond, in which Ni and N are competing for the empty orbital on B.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Kinetic Pathways toward Supramolecular Chiral Polymorphs for Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 bearing two chiral hydrophilic side chains with S&#8208;stereogenic centers was synthesized. This dye exhibited kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H2O (9/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The (S)&#8208;1 monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off&#8208;pathway species Agg. A, which was spontaneously transformed into an on&#8208;pathway metastable aggregate (Agg. B) and subsequently into the thermodynamic Agg. C. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (S)&#8208;1 displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J&#8208;aggregation characteristics were observed for both Agg. B and Agg. C, such as Davydov&#8208;split absorption bands (Agg. B), extremely sharp and intense J&#8208;band with large bathochromic shift (Agg. C), non&#8208;diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that Agg. A had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod&#8208;like helical nanostructures with left&#8208;handedness were observed respectively for Agg. B and Agg. C. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C, thin films consisting of Agg. B and Agg. C with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788 &#8208; 805 nm and g&#8211;factors between &#8211;4.2 &#215; 10&#8211;2 and &#8211;5.1 &#215; 10&#8211;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials for Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising resutls in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle&#8208;based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle&#8208;based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of Design Criteria for V&#8208;based Redox Mediators: Structure&#8208;Function Relationships that Dictate Rates of Heterogeneous Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox mediators are attractive solutions for addressing the stringent kinetic stipulations required for efficient energy conversion processes. In this work, we compare the electrochemical properties of four vanadium complexes, namely [V(acac)3], [V6O7(OMe)12], [nBu4N]3[V6O13(TRISNO2)2], and [nBu4N]5[V18O46(NO3)] in non&#8208;aqueous solutions on glassy carbon electrodes. The goal of this study is to investigate the electron transfer kinetics and diffusivity of these compounds under identical experimental conditions to develop an understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships that dictate the physicochemical properties of vanadium oxide assemblies. Complex selection was dictated by two criteria &#8211; (1) nuclearity of the transition metal complexes (2) distribution of electron density in the native electronic configuration. Our analyses establish that electronic communication between metal centers significantly impacts charge transfer kinetics of these vanadium&#8208;based compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes as Anticancer Drug Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Chemotherapy remains one of the most dominant forms for anticancer treatment. Despite their clinical success, the used chemotherapeutic agents are associated with severe side effect and pharmacological limitations. To overcome these drawbacks there is a need for the development of new types of chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are proposed. The metal complexes were found to be internalized by an energy dependent endocytosis pathway, primary accumulating in the mitochondria. The rhenium(I) complexes demonstrated to induce cell death against a variety of cancer cells in the micromolar range through apoptosis. The lead compound showed to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid at micromolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation Strategies on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and alkaline membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have received great attention as the energy device of next generation. Accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics is the key to improve PEMFCs and AEMFCs performance. Platinum&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used catalysts for ORR, but their high price and low abundance limit the commercialization of fuel cell. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) is considered to be the most likely material to replace Pt&#8208;based catalysts, among which Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic ORR performance and have made great progress in the past decades. With the improvement of synthesis technology and deepening understanding of the ORR mechanism, some reported Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts have shown excellent ORR activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Inspired by the progress, regulation strategies on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C or Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts are summarized in this review from 5 aspects: (1) coordinated atoms, (2) environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3) dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4) metal&#8208;based particle promoter and (5) curved carbon layer. Next, we make our own suggestions on some challenges facing Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C research.</dc:description>

         <title>Superalkalis with Hydrogen as Central Electronegative Atom and their Possible Applications: Ab Initio and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superalkalis having hydrogen as central electronegative core are designed. They exhibit very low ionization energies even lower than that of cesium. The superalkalis are capable of reducing molecules having very low electron affinities. They can act as the building blocks of supersalts and also show remarkable non&#8208;linear optical property.







Abstract
Superalkalis are unusual species having ionization energies lower than that of the alkali metals. These species with various applications are of great importance in chemistry due to their low ionization energies and strong reducing property. A typical superalkali contains a central electronegative core decorated with excess metal ligands. In the quest for novel superalkalis, we have designed the superalkalis HLi2, HLiNa and HNa2 using hydrogen as central electronegative atom for the first time employing high level ab initio (CCSD(T), MP2) and density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) methods. The superalkalis exhibit very low ionization energies, even lower than that of cesium. Stability of these species is verified from binding energy and dissociation energy values. The superalkalis are capable of reducing SO2, NO, CO2, CO and N2 molecules by forming stable ionic complexes and therefore can be used as catalysts for the reduction or activation of systems possessing very low electron affinities. The superalkalis form stable supersalts with tailored properties when interact with a superhalogen. They also show remarkably high non&#8208;linear optical responses, hence could have industrial applications. It is hoped that this work will enrich the superalkali family and spur further theoretical and experimental research in this direction.

         <title>Roles of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Functional Groups in Carbon for Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) are crucial in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction which enables the flexible synthesis of H2O2. Herein, the construction strategies and the specific roles of OFGs are reviewed, aiming to provide inspirations for the future development of advanced carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed great research interests in developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that enables the sustainable and flexible synthesis of H2O2. Carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts exhibit attractive catalytic performance for the 2e&#8722; ORR, where oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) play a decisive role. However, current understanding is far from adequate, and the contribution of OFGs to the catalytic performance remains controversial. Therefore, a critical overview on OFGs in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR is highly desirable. Herein, we go over the methods for constructing OFGs in carbon including chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, and precursor inheritance. Then we review the roles of OFGs in activating carbon toward the 2e&#8722; ORR, focusing on the intrinsic activity of different OFGs and the interplay between OFGs and metal species or defects. At last, we discuss the reasons for inconsistencies among different studies, and personal perspectives on the future development in this field are provided. The results provide insights into the origin of high catalytic activity and selectivity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR and would provide theoretical foundations for the future development in this field.

         <title>Suppressing Cis/Trans &#8216;Ring&#8208;Flipping&#8217; in Organoaluminium(III)&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridyl Dimers&#8211;Design Strategies Towards Lewis Acid Catalysts for Alkene Oligomerisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the cis/trans isomerism of the dimers [R2Al(&#956;&#8208;2&#8208;py&#8217;)]2 is the key to the development of co&#8208;operative cationic Al(III) catalysts that may offer stereo&#8208;control of alkene insertion during polymerization, in a similar way to established Zr(IV)&#8208;based systems. Substitution at the 6&#8208;position of the 2&#8208;py&#8217; groups favors the desired C2&#8208;symmetric trans isomer and the stability of the cations [{RAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ formed by demethylation.







Abstract
Owing to its high natural abundance compared to the commonly used transition (precious) metals, as well as its high Lewis acidity and ability to change oxidation state, aluminium has recently been explored as the basis for a range of single&#8208;site catalysts. This paper aims to establish the ground rules for the development of a new type of cationic alkene oligomerisation catalyst containing two Al(III) ions, with the potential to act co&#8208;operatively in stereoselective assembly. Five new dimers of the type [R2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 (R=Me, iBu; py&#8242;=substituted pyridyl group) with different substituents on the Al atoms and pyridyl rings have been synthesised. The formation of the undesired cis isomers can be suppressed by the presence of substituents on the 6&#8208;position of the pyridyl ring due to steric congestion, with DFT calculations showing that the selection of the trans isomer is thermodynamically controlled. Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 with Ph3C+ to the cations [{MeAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ is highly favourable and that the desired trans disposition of the 2&#8208;pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects.

&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerism&lt;/b&gt; of the dimers [R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(&#956;-2-py&#8217;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the key to the development of co-operative cationic Al(III) catalysts that may offer stereo-control of alkene insertion during polymerization, in a similar way to established Zr(IV)-based systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to its high natural abundance compared to the commonly used transition (precious) metals, as well as its high Lewis acidity and ability to change oxidation state, aluminium has recently been explored as the basis for a range of single-site catalysts. This paper aims to establish the ground rules for the development of a new type of cationic alkene oligomerisation catalyst containing two Al(III) ions, with the potential to act co-operatively in stereoselective assembly. Five new dimers of the type [R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(2-py&#8242;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R=Me, &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu; py&#8242;=substituted pyridyl group) with different substituents on the Al atoms and pyridyl rings have been synthesised. The formation of the undesired &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers can be suppressed by the presence of substituents on the 6-position of the pyridyl ring due to steric congestion, with DFT calculations showing that the selection of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer is thermodynamically controlled. Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(2-py&#8242;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the cations [{MeAl(2-py&#8217;)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-Me)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is highly favourable and that the desired &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; disposition of the 2-pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects. Preliminary experimental studies confirm that demethylation of [Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(6-MeO-2-py)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be achieved using [Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Mono&#8208;Defluorinative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Trifluoromethyl arenes via Multiphoton Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. A series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds can be generated while the the addition of D2O leads to highly deuterated derivatives.







Abstract
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. Trifluoromethyl arenes were demonstrated to undergo selective mono&#8208;defluorinative alkylation under mild reaction conditions providing access to a series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and general functional group tolerance. In addition to the electron&#8208;deficient trifluoromethyl arenes that are easily reduced to the corresponding radical anion, more challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates were also successfully applied. Steady&#8208;State Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching studies indicated that the trifluoromethyl arenes were reduced by the multiphoton excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>Design of Bright Chemogenetic Reporters Based on the Combined Engineering of Fluorogenic Molecular Rotors and of the HaloTag Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of fluorogenic probes (fluorogens) and self&#8208;labeling protein tags represent a promising tool for imaging biological processes with high specificity but it requires the adequation between the fluorogen and its target to ensure a good activation of its fluorescence. In this work, we report a strategy to develop molecular rotors that specifically target HaloTag with a strong enhancement of their fluorescence. The divergent design facilitates the diversification of the structures to tune the photophysical and cellular properties. Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash&#8208;free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Chirality in Inorganic Crystals: from Construction to Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality represents a fundamental characteristic inherent in nature, playing a pivotal role in the emergence of homochirality and the origin of life. While the principles of chirality in organic chemistry are well&#8208;documented, the exploration of chirality within inorganic crystal structures continues to evolve. This ongoing development is primarily due to the diverse nature of crystal/amorphous structures in inorganic materials, along with the intricate symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships in the geometry of their constituent atoms. In this review, we commence with a summary of the foundational concept of chirality in molecules and solid states matters. This is followed by an introduction of structural chirality and electronic chirality in three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials. The construction of chirality in inorganic materials is classified into physical photolithography, wet&#8208;chemistry method, self&#8208;assembly, and chiral imprinting. Highlighting the significance of this field, we also summarize the research progress of chiral inorganic materials for applications in optical activity, enantiomeric recognition and chiral sensing, selective adsorption and enantioselective separation, asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, and chirality&#8208;induced spin polarization. This review aims to provide a reference for ongoing research in chiral inorganic materials and potentially stimulate innovative strategies and novel applications in the realm of chirality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine was prepared via a two&#8208;step electrochemical, photochemical process.

Subsequent photochemical excitation of the 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole species using an ultraviolet lamp releases nitrogen gas and produces a short&#8208;lived nitrilimine intermediate. Rapid cyclization of the nitrilimine intermediate yields a 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine backbone. The scope of this reaction was explored using various tetrazoles and pyrazines. Materials produced were identified using chemical analytical techniques and computationally studied for potential application as an insensitive energetic material.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Basic Ligands and Alkenes on the Regioselectivity of C&#8211;H  Additions of Tertiary Amines to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly regioselective C&#8210;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines and tertiary alkyl amines with simple alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium alkyl complexes. This protocol provided an efficient and  atom&#8208;economical route to structurally diverse tertiary amine derivatives. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates were found to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8210;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines presumably due to the generation of different types of catalytically active species or the formation of relatively stable intermediates. On the basis of the deuterium labeling experiments and KIE experiments, possible catalytical cycles were provided to understand the reaction mechanism as well as the regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Coordination Polymers: Impact of a Lead&#8211;Sulfur Network on Photoconductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8208;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties that originate from infinite M&#8211;S bond networks. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two polymorphs of a two&#8208;dimensional Pb(II) S&#8208;CP with a formula of [Pb(tzdt)(OAc)] (Htzdt = 1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, OAc = acetate). Our findings revealed that the thermodynamic product (KGF&#8208;26) possesses (&#8211;Pb&#8211;O&#8211;)n chains only, whereas the kinetic product (KGF&#8208;27) has both one&#8208;dimensional (&#8211;Pb&#8211;O&#8211;)n chains and two&#8208;dimensional (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n layers. The results of time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations confirmed that KGF&#8208;27 exhibits higher photoconductivity than KGF&#8208;26, which establishes that the inorganic (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks formed in S&#8208;CPs are crucial for achieving high photoconductivity. This is the first experimental demonstration of the impact of the (&#8211;M&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks in S&#8208;CPs on photoconductivity through the comparison of crystal polymorphisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Evolution and Immobilization of Lactobacillus brevis Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Chemo&#8208;enzymatic Synthesis of Rivastigmine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi&#8208;rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co&#8208;immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66%. This study offers an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;induced Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized&#160;Luminescence of Binaphthyl&#8208;bridged Tetrathiapyrenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes containing thioether bonds were synthesized. The pyrenophanes exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) while maintaining the emission wavelength and reversibility. The &#916;glum value reached 0.02, and the FL quenching by heat was negligible. The sign inversion of CPL originates from the inversion of intramolecular excimer chirality associated with excitation dynamics. The two pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures. The thioether linkers can impart flexibility suitable for the inversion of chirality of the excimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Spectroscopic Methods: Towards Chemical Sensor Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) are a rapidly growing field reflecting their potential as selective and sensitive chemical sensors for chiral analytes. The highly tuneable nature of CMOFs enables the size, shape, and non&#8208;covalent interactions to be optimised towards specific analytes to engender strong intermolecular interactions and sensing responses. While CMOFs as chiral chemical sensor devices have been explored with electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), bipolar and chemiresistive sensing techniques, the CMOFs as chiral chemical sensors using spectroscopic methods has received significantly less attention. This review examines the synthesis of CMOFs for chemical sensors with spectroscopic methods such as photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance with a view towards their incorporation into chemical sensor devices. Future directions of the field are highlighted for the generation of functional devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Lewis Acid Properties of Neutral Silver(III) Adducts Containing the AgIII(CF3)3 Moiety</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acetonitrile AgIII complex [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) has been reported independently by Eujen and Naumann in the last century, albeit with intriguing NMR discrepancy. In their reports, 2 was claimed to be obtained starting from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8211; (3.Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8211; (1) via halide abstraction using AgNO3 or acidic treatment, resp. These two synthetic routes are herein reinvestigated. The feasibility of Naumann&#8217;s method is demonstrated, thus providing 2 yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;). The formation of 2&#8217; is unprecedented and was thereby investigated. Both 2 and 2&#8217; were isolated in pure fashion and fully characterized. In turn, halide extraction from 3.Cl leads to the AgIII&#8208;ONO2 anion 5 instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, EA and Sc&#8208;XRD.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and (Photo)Catalytic Behavior of Ce&#8208;MOFs Containing Perfluoroalkylcarboxylate Linkers: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure.&#160;We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8208;3.1 eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.</dc:description>

The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF-801 and UiO-66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8-3.1 eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
