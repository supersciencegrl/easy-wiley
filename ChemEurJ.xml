         <title>Molecular Packing Topology and Interactions to Decipher Mechanical Compliances in Dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible optoelectronics is the need of the hour as the market moves toward wearable and conformable devices. Crystalline &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials offer high performance as active materials compared to their amorphous counterpart, but they are typically brittle. This poses a significant challenge that needs to be overcome to unfold their potential in optoelectronic devices. Unveiling the molecular packing topology and identifying interaction descriptors that can seamlessly accommodate strain offers essential guiding principles for developing conjugated materials as active components in flexible optoelectronics. The molecular packing and interaction topology of eight crystal systems of dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene derivatives are investigated. Face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacks in an inclined orientation relative to the bending surface can accommodate expansion and compression with minimal molecular motion from their equilibrium positions. This configuration exhibits good compliance towards mechanical strain, while a similar structure with a criss&#8208;cross arrangement capable of distributing applied strain equally in opposite directions enhances the flexibility. Molecular arrangements that cannot reversibly undergo expansion and compression exhibit brittleness. In the isometric CT crystals, the disproportionate strength of the interactions along the bending plane and orthogonal directions makes these materials sustain a moderate bending strain. These results provide an updated explanation for the elastic bending in semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction can be considered an ideal solution due to its green and sustainable properties, and is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize four&#8208;membered ring motifs. Although research on the [2+2] photocycloaddition of alkynes is challenging because of the diminished reactivity of alkynes, and the more significant ring strain of the products, remarkable achievements have been made in this field. In this article, we highlight the recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of alkynes, with focus on the reaction mechanism and the late&#8208;stage synthetic applications. Advances in obtaining cyclobutenes, azetines, and oxetene active intermediates continue to be breakthroughs in this fascinating field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Co&#8208;adsorption of Alcohols and Amines for Visible Light Driven Oxidative Condensation Using Iron&#8208;based MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imines are essential intermediates in organic transformations, and is generally produced by dehydrogenative condensation of alcohols and amines with the assist of specialized catalysts and additives. Heterogeneous photocatalysis provides a sustainable platform for such process without the using of toxic oxidants, yet a functionalized photocatalyst with optimized co&#8208;adsorption of reactants needs to be developed to promote the stoichiometric oxidative condensation under ambient conditions. Here, we show that benzyl alcohol and aniline adsorb non&#8208;interferingly on the Fe node and the linker sites of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) metal organic frameworks (MOFs), respectively. The co&#8208;adsorption of both reactants barely influences the reduction of molecular oxygen to generate oxygen radicals, resulting in efficient formation of benzaldehyde under visible light. Additionally, the weak adsorption of water together with surface acidity of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) promote a rapid condensation of benzaldehyde with aniline and the depletion of generated water, achieving an efficient C&#8208;N bond creation for a wide range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of Germanium Nanoparticles from Arylgermanium Trihydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Germanium is a promising basis for nanomaterials due to its low toxicity and valuable optical and electronic properties. However, germanium nanomaterials have seen little research compared to other group 14 elements due to unpredictable chemical behavior and high costs. Here, we report the dehydrocoupling of o&#8208;tolylgermanium trihydride to amorphous nanoparticles. The reaction is facilitated through reflux at 162 &#176;C and can be accelerated with an amine base catalyst. Through cleavage of both H2 and toluene, new Ge&#8208;Ge bonds form. This results in nanoparticles consisting of crosslinked germanium with o&#8208;tolyl termination. The particles are 2&#8208;6 nm in size and have masses above approximately 3500 Da. The organic substituents are promising for further functionalization. Combined with strong absorption up to 600 nm and moderate solubility and air stability, there are numerous possibilities for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Structural, Optical and Magnetic Modifications in Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensibility of lanthanide coordination complexes to the crystal field strength makes them ideal candidates for switching Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behavior and piezochromic effect under applied high pressure. A complementary structure&#8208;property relationship is established with the combination of high pressure magnetometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction allowing to explain the observed structural, optical and magnetic modifications.







Abstract
Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets are fascinating objects that break magnetic performance records with observable magnetic bistability at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen, paving the way for potential applications in high&#8208;density data storage. The switching of lanthanide SMM has been successfully achieved using several external stimuli such as redox reaction, pH titration, light irradiation or solvation/desolvation thanks to the high sensitivity of the magnetic anisotropy to any structural change in the lanthanide surrounding. Nevertheless, the use of applied high pressure as an external stimulus is largely underused, especially considering that it can be combined with high pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction to establish a complementary structure&#8208;property relationship. This Concept article summarizes the few relevant examples of investigations of lanthanide SMMs under applied high pressure, provides conclusions on the effect of such stimulus on molecular structures and magnetic anisotropy, and finally draws perspective on the future development of magnetic measurements under applied pressure.

         <title>In situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8208;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow Monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazonium trifluoroacetates for biphenyls are an underrated aryl radical source for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. This concept does not require any additional catalysts to perform an efficient and selective reaction. The photoarylation is supported by the application of Flow Chemistry using microreactors and modern LED technology. An integrated benchtop NMR spectrometer enables real&#8208;time analysis of the substituted products.







Abstract
A novel class of diazonium salts is introduced for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling to produce (substituted) biphenyls. As common diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts fail, soluble and safe aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are applied. In this mild synthesis route no catalysts are required to generate an aryl&#8208;radical by irradiation with UV&#8208;A light (365&#8197;nm). This reactive species undergoes direct C&#8722;H arylation at an arene, forming the product in reasonable reaction times. With the implementation of a continuous flow setup in a capillary photoreactor 13 different biphenyl derivatives are successfully synthesized. By integrating an inline 19F&#8208;NMR benchtop spectrometer, samples are reliably quantified as the fluorine&#8208;substituents act as a probe. Here, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy is a perfect tool to monitor the continuously operated system, which produces fine chemicals of industrial relevance even in a multigram scale.

As common diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts fail, soluble and safe aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are applied. In this mild synthesis route no catalysts are required to generate an aryl-radical by irradiation with UV-A light (365&#8197;nm). This reactive species undergoes direct C&#8722;H arylation at an arene, forming the product in reasonable reaction times. With the implementation of a continuous flow setup in a capillary photoreactor 13 different biphenyl derivatives are successfully synthesized. By integrating an inline &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-NMR benchtop spectrometer, samples are reliably quantified as the fluorine-substituents act as a probe. Here, real-time NMR spectroscopy is a perfect tool to monitor the continuously operated system, which produces fine chemicals of industrial relevance even in a multigram scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first example of phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole&#8208;cored blue fluorophore with HLCT feature was reported. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped pure blue OLEDs demonstrated the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with the maximum EQE of 7.99&#8201;% accompanied with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, even maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
It is vital to develop highly efficient non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off for applications in display and lighting. Herein, two blue D&#8208;A fluorophores TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO are designed and synthesized, in which phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole (PO) acts as the acceptor and triphenylamine as the donor. TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO display good thermal stability and efficient luminescence efficiency in neat film. Results based on photophysical property and theoretical calculation demonstrate that TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO possess the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, which can utilize the triplet exciton to achieve highly efficient electroluminance (EL). The non&#8208;doped OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PO/TPA&#8208;DPO as pure emissive layer show the uniform EL emission peak at 468&#8197;nm, corresponding to CIE coordinates of (0.168, 0.187) and (0.167, 0.167), respectively. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs provide the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.99&#8201;% and high exciton utility efficiency of 48.4&#8201;%~72.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based device exhibits low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off, still maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Those findings state clearly that PO is a promising building block of blue fluorophore with a potential HLCT feature to be applied in non&#8208;doped OLEDs.

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene based Cu(I) metallocycle constituting the prototype for reversibly photoswitchable (3d&lt;M&#8208;)metallocycles (i.&#8201;e. without disassembly) is presented. Its ultrafast dynamics and the yield of the respective photostationary state reveal strong similarities with archetypical azobenzene. The unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD elucidates the interplay of dynamics and solvation. Coupled with quantum chemical calculations, this interdisciplinary approach reveals a non&#8208;cooperative photoisomerization.







Abstract
The novel photoswitchable ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Azobenz(metPA)2 (1) is used to prepare a [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 metallocycle (2), whose photoisomerization was characterized using static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. Optical studies demonstrate the highly quantitative and reproducible photoinduced cyclic E/Z switching without decay of the complex. Accordingly and best to our knowledge, [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 constitutes the first reversibly photoswitchable (3d)&#8208;metallocycle based on azobenzene. The photoinduced multiexponential dynamics in the sub&#8208;picosecond to few picosecond time domain of 1 and 2 have been assessed. These ultrafast dynamics as well as the yield of the respective photostationary state (PSSZ = 65&#8201;%) resemble the behavior of archetypical azobenzene. Also, the innovative pump&#8208;probe laser technique of gas phase transient photodissociation (&#964;&#8208;PD) in a mass spectrometric ion trap was used to determine the intrinsic relaxation dynamics for the isolated complex. These results are consistent with the results from femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) in solution, emphasizing the azobenzene&#8208;like dynamics of 2. This unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD enables valuable insights into the prevailing interplay of dynamics and solvation. Both analyses (in solution and gas phase) and quantum chemical calculations reveal a negligible effect of the metal coordination on the switching mechanism and electronic pathway, which suggests a non&#8208;cooperative isomerization process.

         <title>Fingerprints of Chalcogen Bonding Revealed Through 77Se&#8208;NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oriented chemical shift tensor can reveal anisotropy in the electron density around a reporter nucleus. Here we measure the 77Se chemical shift tensor in a single crystal, which shows significant anisotropy due to participation of the selenium in a chalcogen bond. This technique suggests the presence of a potential second chalcogen bond site, which has not previously been observed in this system.







Abstract
77Se&#8208;NMR is used to characterise several chalcogen bonded complexes of derivatives of the organoselenium drug ebselen, exploring a range of electron demand. NMR titration experiments support the intuitive understanding that chalcogen bond donors bearing more electron withdrawing substituents give rise stronger chalcogen bonds. The chemical shift of the selenium nucleus is also shown to move upfield as it participates in a chalcogen bond. Solid&#8208;state NMR is used to explore chalcogen bonding in co&#8208;crystals. Due to the lack of molecular reorientation on the NMR timescale in the solid state, the shape of the chemical shift tensor can be determined using this technique. A range of co&#8208;crystals are shown to have extremely large chemical shift anisotropy, which suggests a strongly anisotropic electron density distribution around the selenium atom. A single crystal NMR experiment was conducted using one of the co&#8208;crystals, affording the absolute orientation of the chemical shift tensor within the crystal. This showed that the selenium nucleus is strongly shielded in the direction of the chalcogen bond (due to the approach of the lone pair of the Lewis base), and strongly deshielded in the perpendicular direction. The orientation of the deshielded axis is consistent with the presence of a second &#963;&#8208;hole which is not participating in a chalcogen bond, showing the profound effect of electron density anisotropy on the chemical shift.

         <title>Electrochemical Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acids to Their Cyclic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical dehydrative reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. The electrochemically generated anhydrides can be directly employed for amidation reactions. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by 18O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate during electrolysis.







Abstract
An intramolecular electrochemical dehydration reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. This electrolysis allows dicarboxylic acids as naturally abundant, inexpensive, safe, and readily available starting materials to be transformed into carboxylic anhydrides under mild reaction conditions. No conventional dehydration reagent is required. The obtained cyclic anhydrides are highly valuable reagents in organic synthesis, and in this report, we use them in&#8208;situ for acylation reactions of amines to synthesize amides. This work is part of the recent progress in electrochemical dehydration, which &#8211; in contrast to electrochemical dehydrogenative reactions for example &#8211; is an underexplored field of research. The reaction mechanism was investigated by 18O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate by electrochemical oxidation and hydrolysis of the thiocyanate&#8208;supporting electrolyte. This transformation is not a classical Kolbe electrolysis, because it is non&#8208;decarboxylative, and all carbon atoms of the carboxylic acid starting material are contained in the carboxylic anhydride. In total, 20 examples are shown with NMR yields up to 71&#8201;%.

The electrochemically generated anhydrides can be directly employed for amidation reactions. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate during electrolysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intramolecular electrochemical dehydration reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. This electrolysis allows dicarboxylic acids as naturally abundant, inexpensive, safe, and readily available starting materials to be transformed into carboxylic anhydrides under mild reaction conditions. No conventional dehydration reagent is required. The obtained cyclic anhydrides are highly valuable reagents in organic synthesis, and in this report, we use them in-situ for acylation reactions of amines to synthesize amides. This work is part of the recent progress in electrochemical dehydration, which &#8211; in contrast to electrochemical dehydrogenative reactions for example &#8211; is an underexplored field of research. The reaction mechanism was investigated by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate by electrochemical oxidation and hydrolysis of the thiocyanate-supporting electrolyte. This transformation is not a classical Kolbe electrolysis, because it is non-decarboxylative, and all carbon atoms of the carboxylic acid starting material are contained in the carboxylic anhydride. In total, 20 examples are shown with NMR yields up to 71&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Parametric Analysis of Donor Activation for Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a semi&#8208;automated assay to assign TA (activation temperature) and TD (decomposition temperature) to glycosyl donors, we established correlations to the assigned temperatures to both structural effects (protecting groups and monosaccharide core) and other experimental parameters (reagent concentrations).







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of complex oligosaccharides relies on efficient and highly reproducible glycosylation reactions. The outcome of a glycosylation is contingent upon several environmental factors, such as temperature, acidity, the presence of residual moisture, as well as the steric, electronic, and conformational aspects of the reactants. Each glycosylation proceeds rapidly and with a high yield within a rather narrow temperature range. For better control over glycosylations and to ensure fast and reliable reactions, a systematic analysis of 18 glycosyl donors revealed the effect of reagent concentration, water content, protecting groups, and structure of the glycosyl donors on the activation temperature. With these insights, we parametrize the first step of the glycosylation reaction to be executed reliably and efficiently.

         <title>Development of Biocompatible Cu(I)&#8208;Microdevices for Bioorthogonal Uncaging and Click Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the development of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I) catalysts and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. Polymeric devices featuring a range of tridentate ligands and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. We also present a preliminary exploration of their use for in&#8197;situ PROTAC synthesis through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions emerged a decade ago as a novel strategy to implement spatiotemporal control over enzymatic functions and pharmacological interventions. The use of this methodology in experimental therapy is driven by the ambition of improving the tolerability and PK properties of clinically&#8208;used therapeutic agents. The preclinical potential of bioorthogonal catalysis has been validated in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo with the in&#8197;situ generation of a broad range of drugs, including cytotoxic agents, anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and anxiolytics. In this article, we report our investigations towards the preparation of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I)&#8208;microdevices and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. A range of ligand&#8208;functionalized polymeric devices and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. Last, we present a preliminary exploration of their use for the synthesis of PROTACs through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.

         <title>Robust Red&#8208;Absorbing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;property guidelines are disclosed for creating robust donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) photochromes. A comprehensive investigation has revealed that a DASA photochrome with a low degree of charge separation is desired to achieve a robust, reversible photoswitching. Other indirect factors that could modulate the DASA photoswitching in polymer thin films are also discussed in detail.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct (DASA), a class of push&#8208;pull negative photochrome, has received large interest lately owing to its versatile synthesis, modularity and excellent photoswitching in solutions. From a technological perspective, it is imperative for this class of photoswitches to work robustly in solid state, e.&#8201;g. thin films. We feature a molecular framework for the optimized design of DASAs by introducing a new thioindoline donor (D3) and assessing its performance against known 2nd generation indoline&#8208;based donors. The systematic structure&#8208;function investigations suggest that to achieve robust reversible photoswitching, a ground state with low charge separation is desired. DASAs with stronger electron donors and a larger charge separation in the ground state result in a low population of the photothermalstationary state (PTSS) and reduced photostability. The DASA with thioindoline donor (D3A3) seems to be a special case among the donor series as it causes a red shift (ca. 15&#8197;nm), however with less polarization of the ground state and marginally better photostability as compared to the unsubstituted 2&#8208;methyl indoline (D1A3). We also emphasize the consideration of the key additional factors that can modulate the red&#8208;light photoswitching properties of DASA chromophores in polymer thin films, which might not be dominant in homogenous solution state.

         <title>Accelerating Cellular Uptake with Unnatural Amino Acid for Inhibiting Immunosuppressive Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrates that the integration of unnatural amino acids (L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine) into peptide assemblies significantly accelerates their accumulation within prostate cancer cells, boosting their capacity to hinder cancer proliferation. This work paves a way for engineering supramolecular medicine, potentially heightening the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based treatments for prostate cancer. It may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for treating other cancers.







Abstract
Targeting immunosuppressive metastatic cancer cells is a key challenge in therapy. We recently have shown that a rigid&#8208;rod aromatic, pBP&#8722;NBD, that responds to enzymes and kill immunosuppressive metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells in mimetic bone microenvironment. However, pBP&#8722;NBD demonstrated moderate efficacy against CRPC cells. To enhance activity, we incorporated the unnatural amino acid L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine (L&#8208; or D&#8722;BiP) into pBP&#8722;NBD, drastically increasing cellular uptake and CRPC inhibition. Specifically, we inserted BiP into pBP&#8722;NBD to target mOS (Saos2 and SJSA1) and CRPC (VCaP and PC3) cells with overexpressed phosphatases. Our results show that the D&#8208;peptide backbone with an aspartate methyl diester at the C&#8208;terminal offers the highest activity against these immunosuppressive mOS and CRPC cells. Importantly, imaging shows that the peptide assemblies almost instantly enter the cells and accumulate primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum of Saos2, SJSA1, and PC3 cells and at the lysosomes of VCaP cells. By using BiP to boost cellular uptake and self&#8208;assembly within cancer cells, this work illustrates an unnatural hydrophobic amino acid as a versatile and effective residue to boost endocytosis of synthetic peptides for intracellular self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>A General Concept for the Electronic and Steric Modification of 1&#8208;Metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes: A Case Study of Group 4 Metallocene Complexes</title>

Ring&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes were prepared from suitable organolithium precursors. The effect of introduction of phenyl groups was studied using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. For the first time cyclic voltammetry, EPR, and solid state NMR spectroscopy were used to support structural and DFT data.







Abstract
The synthesis of group 4 metal 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes as organometallic analogues of elusive 1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene has so far been limited to SiMe3 substituted examples. We present the synthesis of two Ph substituted dilithiated ligand precursors for the preparation of four new 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M] (M=Ti, Zr; ebthi=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl)). The organolithium compounds [Li2(RC3Ph)] (1&#8201;b: R=Ph, 1&#8201;c: R=SiMe3) as well as the metallacycles of the general formula [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M(R1C3R2)] (2&#8201;b: M=Ti, R1=R2=Ph, 2&#8201;c: M=Ti, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3; 3&#8201;b: M=Zr, R1=R2=Ph; 3&#8201;c: M=Zr, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3) were fully characterised. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and quantum chemical bond analysis of the Ti and Zr complexes reveal ligand influence on the biradicaloid character of the titanocene complexes. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy of structurally similar Ti complexes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)Ti(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] (2&#8201;a), 2&#8201;b, and 2&#8201;c was carried out to evaluate the accessibility of an EPR active triplet state. Cyclic voltammetry shows that introduction of Ph groups renders the complexes easier to reduce. 13C CPMAS NMR analysis provides insights into the cause of the low field shift of the resonances of metal&#8208;bonded carbon atoms and provides evidence of the absence of the &#946;&#8722;C&#8722;Ti interaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Superbulky Amide Ligands by Addition of Polar Reagents to Sila&#8211;Imine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superbulky amide ligands are generally not accessible by deprotonation of their parent amines. Addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8208;imine precursor gave a range of metal complexes with superbulky amide ligands that generally act as weakly coordinating anions.







Abstract
The chemistry of extremely bulky amide ligands is troubled by difficulties in deprotonation of the parent amine. As an alternative route to superbulky amide reagents, the addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8211;imine has been investigated. Attempts to synthesize the superbulky amide anion (tBu3Si)2N&#8722; by addition of tBuLi to tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) failed and gave tBu3Si(tBu2HSi)NLi and isobutene. Reaction of the sila&#8211;imine with KOtBu successfully led to tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NK which crystallized as a separated ion&#8211;pair. Reaction with the slightly bulkier KOAd (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl) led in presence of THF to ether ring&#8211;opening. Reaction with tBuOH gave tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NH but this amine cannot be easily deprotonated. Reaction with (BDI*)MgnBu in presence of THF gave (BDI*)Mg+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(THF)2 and the non&#8211;coordinating anion tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#8722;; BDI*=&#223;&#8208;diketiminate ligand HC[C(tBu)N&#8722;DIPP]2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl. Reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) led to a Mg complex with one amide ligand: tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#8722;. The other superbulky amide anion isomerized by internal deprotonation of a tBu&#8208;substituent to give a primary carbanion that is also coordinated to Mg. Although the amide&#8211;to&#8211;carbanion isomerization is highly contrathermodynamic, it allows for coordination of both anions to a single Mg center. The new bulky amides are rare cases of halogen&#8211;free weakly coordinating anions.

The products of two isomeric thiophene/triptycene para&#8208;quinones with malononitrile provide insights into modulating potential inversion in 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane type electron&#8208;acceptors. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding influences both the product distribution of the reaction to make the quinones, and the NMR chemical shift of the bridgehead hydrogens involved.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of a series of 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane (TCAQ) inspired electron acceptors based on thiophene&#8208;fused quinone and triptycene motifs is presented. This has yielded insights into structure&#8208;property relationships for establishing and modulating simultaneous two&#8208;electron reduction processes in TCAQ analogues. These new compounds were synthesised using a Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation between triptycene and thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarbonyl chloride. Isomeric para&#8208;quinones featuring a [c]&#8208;fused thiophene on one side and a &#946;,&#946;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;fused triptycene on the other were isolated alongside a thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;diketone which bears two triptycene fragments. Knoevenagel condensation of these products with malononitrile produced a quinoidal bis(dicyanomethylene), an oxo&#8208;dicyanomethylene and an acyclic bis(dicyanomethylene). This series of new electron accepting molecules has been studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography and the implications of their 3D structures on NMR and UV/vis absorbance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results have been ascertained with conclusions underpinned by computational methods.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Sensitive Double Chromophore Fluorescent Dye for Live&#8208;Tracking of Lipophagy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live monitoring the fate of lipid droplets (LD) within cells! To visualize and quantify lipophagy in an easily applicable, non&#8208;toxic and protein label&#8208;free approach by means of fluorescence microscopy, a unique dye called Lipo&#8208;Fluddy&#8208;1 was developed. This synthetic dye is characterized by a high lipophilicity and contains two chromophores, one of which only fluoresces at low pH. Its usefulness was demonstrated by the flow cytometry investigation of lipophagy in several cell lines.







Abstract
Lipid droplet (LD) degradation provides metabolic energy and important building blocks for various cellular processes. The two major LD degradation pathways include autophagy (lipophagy), which involves delivery of LDs to autolysosomes, and lipolysis, which is mediated by lipases.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Live monitoring the fate of lipid droplets (LD) within cells&lt;/b&gt;! To visualize and quantify lipophagy in an easily applicable, non-toxic and protein label-free approach by means of fluorescence microscopy, a unique dye called &lt;b&gt;Lipo-Fluddy-1&lt;/b&gt; was developed. This synthetic dye is characterized by a high lipophilicity and contains two chromophores, one of which only fluoresces at low pH. Its usefulness was demonstrated by the flow cytometry investigation of lipophagy in several cell lines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid droplet (LD) degradation provides metabolic energy and important building blocks for various cellular processes. The two major LD degradation pathways include autophagy (lipophagy), which involves delivery of LDs to autolysosomes, and lipolysis, which is mediated by lipases. While abnormalities in LD degradation are associated with various pathological disorders, our understanding of lipophagy is still rudimentary. In this study, we describe the development of a lipophilic dye containing two fluorophores, one of which is pH-sensitive and the other pH-stable. We further demonstrate that this &#8220;Lipo-Fluddy&#8221; can be used to visualize and quantify lipophagy in living cells, in an easily applicable and protein label-free approach. After estimating the ability of compound candidates to penetrate LDs, we synthesized several BODIPY and (pH-switchable) rhodol dyes, whose fluorescence properties (incl. their photophysical compatibility) were analyzed. Of three Lipo-Fluddy dyes synthesized, one exhibited the desired properties and allowed observation of lipophagy by fluorescence microscopy.

         <title>Stabilization of the Neutral [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) Radical by Hetero&#8208;Bimetal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hetero&#8208;bimetal coordination strategy was successfully applied to stabilize a ring&#8208;expanded porphyrin radical, [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0), i.&#8201;e., [25]Rosarin, in its neutral form by a mixed BF2/Rh(CO)2 coordination in the core.







Abstract
Stabilization of hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) (named &#8220;rosarin&#8221;) in its 25&#960; radical state is achieved using a hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination strategy. The antiaromatic BF2 complex B&#8208;1 was first synthesized, and then rhodium ion was inserted into B&#8208;1 to produce the BF2/Rh(CO)2 mixed complex Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 as a highly air&#8208;stable radical. The structures of B&#8208;1 and Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, and the antiaromatic or radical character was identified by various spectroscopy evidence and theoretical calculations. Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 exhibits excellent redox properties, enabling amphoteric aromatic&#8208;antiaromatic conversion to their 24/26&#960; states. Compared to the 24/26&#960; conjugation systems on the same skeleton, Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 has the narrowest electrochemical and optical band gaps, with the longest absorption band at 1010&#8197;nm. The ring&#8208;current analysis reveals intense paratropic currents for B&#8208;1 and co&#8208;existing diatropic&#8208;paratropic currents for Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1. This hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination system provides a novel platform for organic radical stabilization on porphyrinoids, showing the prospect of modulating ligand oxidation states through rational coordination design.

         <title>Predisposition in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Assembly of Tetrahedral Boronate Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Latent intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the building blocks play a crucial role in the assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs) via Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). These intramolecular interactions emerge from induced conformational restrictions during cage assembly, ultimately dictating the reaction outcome in a relay&#8208;like fashion.







Abstract
Directional bonding strategies guide the design of complex molecular architectures, yet challenges arise due to emergent behavior. Rigid structures face geometric constraints and sensitivity to mismatches, hindering the efficient assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs). Harnessing intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions offers a promising solution, broadening geometrical possibilities and enhancing adaptability to boost assembly yields. However, identifying these interactions remains challenging, with their full potential sometimes latent until final assembly. This study explores these challenges by synthesizing boronic acid tripods with varied oxygen positions at the tripodal feet and investigating their role in assembling tetrahedral boronate MOCs. Our results reveal substantial differences in the assembly efficiency among tripods. While the building blocks with oxygen in the benzylic position relative to the central aromatic ring form the MOCs in high yields, those with the oxygen atom directly bound to the central aromatic ring, only yield traces. Through X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analyses, we elucidate how intramolecular interactions profoundly influence the geometry of the building blocks and cages in a relay&#8208;like fashion, highlighting the importance of considering intramolecular interactions in the rational design of (supra)molecular architectures.

In this work, the chemoselective perfluoroalkylation of triarylamines (TAA) is accomplished by visible light activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex between TAA and perfluoroalkyl iodides RF&#8722;I. The resulting perfluoroalkylated triarylamines, TAA&#8208;RF, undergo stereospecific unprecedented 6&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization under photosensitized reaction in acetone to endo&#8208;carbazoles exclusively in quantitative yields.







Abstract
Blue LEDs&#8208;irradiation of a mixture of N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and perfluoroalkyl iodides (RF&#8722;I) &#8211; Electron Donor Acceptor (EDA)&#8208;complex &#8211; in the presence of triphenylamines (TPAs) in an aqueous solvent mixture afforded mono&#8208;perfluoroalkylated triphenylamines (RF&#8722;TPA) in good yields.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of PdCuAg and CeO2 Nanowires Hybrid with Abundant Heterojunction Interface for Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid of PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires with structural (abundant heterojunction/interfaces and ultrathin nanowire structure) and compositional advantages were facile prepared by one&#8208;pot method, thus embracing enhanced electrocatalytic performance for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Introducing CeO2 into Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via a one&#8208;pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.

Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires hybrid via a one-pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Revision of a Natural Tetrasaccharide from Starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell</title>

The synthesis and structural revision of the natural 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated tetrasaccharides via dual DPPA&#8208;directed [2+2] glycosylation.







Abstract
Starfish provide important saponins with diverse bioactivities as the secondary metabolites, among which 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides are commonly found. Preparation of those 1,2&#8208;trans 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides usually relies on 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation requiring the selective installation and cleavage of 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl groups. A convergent synthesis using 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated oligosaccharide donors would be more straightforward but also pose greater challenges. Herein, we report a convergent synthesis of a distinctive tetrasaccharide isolated from starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell. Dual 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) groups at O3 and O4 on galactose moiety led to high &#946;&#8208;selectivities (&#946;/&#945;=12/1 or &#946; only) in the challenging [2+2] glycosylation, giving the desired tetrasaccharides in &gt;90&#8201;% yields from the 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated disaccharide donors. These synthetic studies have also unambiguously revised the structure of these natural tetrasaccharides. This work would facilitate further studies on new inhibitors of &#945;&#8208;glucosidase as hypoglycemic drugs.

         <title>A Halogen Bonding [2]Rotaxane Shuttle for Chloride&#8208;Selective Optical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic halogen bonding multi&#8208;station [2]rotaxane displays a selective optical response to chloride over bromide and iodide anions. Chloride binding induces a translocation of the isophthalamide&#8208;functionalised macrocycle from the naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations to the halogen bonding station, leading to a reduction in the donor&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer absorption arising from macrocycle&#8208;NDI interactions, whereas the larger halides are excluded from the interlocked cavity.







Abstract
The first example of a [2]rotaxane shuttle capable of selective optical sensing of chloride anions over other halides is reported. The rotaxane was synthesised via a chloride ion template&#8208;directed cyclisation of an isophthalamide macrocycle around a multi&#8208;station axle containing peripheral naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations and a halogen bonding (XB) bis(iodotriazole) based station. Proton NMR studies indicate the macrocycle resides preferentially at the NDI stations in the free rotaxane, where it is stabilised by aromatic donor&#8208;acceptor charge transfer interactions between the axle NDI and macrocycle hydroquinone moieties. Addition of chloride ions in an aqueous&#8208;acetone solvent mixture induces macrocycle translocation to the XB anion binding station to facilitate the formation of convergent XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&#8722; and hydrogen bonding HB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&#8722; interactions, which is accompanied by a reduction of the charge&#8208;transfer absorption band. Importantly, little to no optical response was induced by addition of bromide or iodide to the rotaxane, indicative of the size discriminative steric inaccessibility of the interlocked cavity to the larger halides, demonstrating the potential of using the mechanical bond effect as a potent strategy and tool in chloride&#8208;selective chemo&#8208;sensing applications in aqueous containing solvent environments.

Synopsis: Mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated carbodiphosphoranes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond, have been synthesised. The bonding situation in these complexes was elucidated computationally, while their reactivity was investigated experimentally.







Abstract
The reaction of organoberyllium compounds with hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane yields mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated complexes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond. The bonding situation in these compounds together with a simple carbodiphosphorane and an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene adduct was analysed with energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence as well as with quantum theory of atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules. Furthermore, the driving forces accountable for mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllation were elucidated along with the reactivity of the Be=C bond.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction to NH3 by Enhancing N2 Activation via Interaction between Au Nanoparticles and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;101(Fe) with a large specific surface area has a strong N2 adsorption capacity, which promotes the enrichment of N2 on the surface of the catalyst, and the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the activation of N2, thereby effectively promoting the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted much attention as a sustainable ammonia production technology, but it needs further exploration due to its slow kinetics and the existence of competitive side reactions. In this research, xAu/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) catalysts were obtained by loading gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto MIL&#8208;101(Fe) using a one&#8208;step reduction strategy. Herein, MIL&#8208;101(Fe), with high specific surface area and strong N2 adsorption capacity, is used as a support to disperse Au NPs to increase the electrochemical active surface area. Au NPs, with a high NRR activity, is introduced as the active site to promote charge transfer and intermediate formation rates. More importantly, the strong interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the electron transfer between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe), thereby enhancing the activation of N2 and achieving efficient NRR. Among the prepared catalysts, 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) has the highest NH3 yield of 46.37&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 39.38&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V (vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ FTIR reveals that the NRR mechanism of 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) follows the binding alternating pathway and also indicates that the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) strengthens the activation of the N&#8801;N bond in the rate&#8208;limiting process, thereby accelerating the NRR process.

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Oriented Asymmetric Catalysis: Conformational Modulation of Transition State Multivalency during a Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Assembly of a Pharmaceutically Relevant Atropisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Albeit of significative recent pharmaceutical interest, there is an almost complete absence of asymmetric methods to deliver enantioenriched, axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinazolinediones. Posed with the challenge of establishing such a catalytic method, we developed a new class of superbasic bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts. In addition, we carried out extensive computational modeling to dissect the role of the individual elements in governing the catalyst's activity and selectivity.







Abstract
A new class of superbasic, bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts is presented, which enables the organocatalytic, atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral quinazolinediones. Computational modeling unveiled the conformational modulation of the catalyst by a novel phenyl urea N&#8208;cap, that preorganizes the structure into the active, folded state. A previously unanticipated noncovalent interaction involving a difluoroacetamide acting as a hybrid mono&#8208; or bidentate hydrogen bond donor emerged as a decisive control element inducing atroposelectivity. These discoveries spurred from a scaffold&#8208;oriented project inspired from a fascinating investigational BTK inhibitor featuring two stable chiral axes and relies on a mechanistic framework that was foreign to the extant lexicon of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Diastereoselective Dearomatizing Cyclizations of 5&#8208;Arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Samarium Diiodide &#8211; A Computational Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations including all f&#8208;electrons of samarium allowed a detailed mechanistic analysis of the synthetically valuable reductive cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with samarium diiodide to bicyclic products. Details of the crucial electron&#8208;transfer processes, the diastereoselectivity, the regioselectivity and the influence of HMPA as ligand were correctly predicted.







Abstract
This study analyzes the samarium diiodide&#8208;promoted cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones to dearomatized bicyclic products utilizing density functional theory. The reaction involves a single electron transfer to the carbonyl group, which occurs synchronously with the rate determining cyclization event, and a second subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. These redox reactions are accurately computed employing small core pseudo potentials explicitly involving all f&#8208;electrons of samarium. Comparison of the energies of the possible final products rules out thermodynamic control of the observed regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Kinetic control via appropriate transition states is correctly predicted, but to obtain reasonable energy levels the influence of the co&#8208;solvent hexamethylphosphortriamide has to be estimated by using a correction term. The steric effect of the bulky samarium ligands is decisive for the observed stereoselectivity. Carbonyl groups in para&#8208;position of the aryl group change the regioselectivity of the cyclization and lead to spiro compounds. The computations suggest again kinetic control of this deviating outcome. However, the standard mechanism has to be modified and the involvement of a complex activated by two SmI2 moieties is proposed in which two electrons are transferred simultaneously to form the new C&#8722;C bond. Computation of model intermediates show the feasibility of this alternative+ mechanism.

         <dc:description>
Spot on the first azobenzene&#8208;based metallocycle that reversibly undergoes photoisomerization without disassembly! The cover feature illustrates the reversible switching between the (E,E) and (Z,Z) isomers of [Cu2(3,3&#8217;&#8208;azobenz(metPA)2](BF4)2. The electronic spectra reflect the unique combination of femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption in solution and femtosecond pump&#8211;probe photodissociation in the gas phase, which were used to characterize the primary switching dynamics. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Riehn, R. Diller, S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400205).

         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkylation reactions of triarylamines with perfluoroalkyl iodides by visible&#8208;light irradiation of EDA complexes have been achieved. When these perfluoroalkylated triarylamines are subjected to acetone&#8208;sensitized irradiation, a highly stereospecific electrocyclization to endo perfluoroalkylated carbazoles is obtained. Mechanistic and photophysical insights are studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;M. Bonesi, A. Postigo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400905).

         <dc:description>
Soluble aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are introduced for safe photochemical aryl&#8211;aryl coupling to produce industrially relevant biphenyls, even on a gram scale. While conventional diazonium tetrafluoroborates fail, this mild synthesis requires no catalysts but only UV&#8208;A light to generate aryl radicals for direct C&#8722;H arylation of various arenes. By implementing a capillary flow photoreactor, 13 biphenyl derivatives were synthesised and quantified by real&#8208;time 19F NMR spectroscopy as an in&#8208;line PAT tool. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Deckers and T.&#8197;H. Rehm (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303692).

The preparation methods and electrochemical applications of MOFs and their derivatives composite materials in the field of supercapacitors are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and prospects of MOFs in supercapacitor are discussed.







Abstract
Up to now, the mainstream adoption of renewable energy has brought about substantial transformations in the electricity and energy sector. This shift has garnered considerable attention within the scientific community. Supercapacitors, known for their exceptional performance metrics like good charge/discharge capability, strong power density, as well as extended cycle longevity, have gained widespread traction across various sectors, including transportation and aviation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique traits including adaptable structure, highly customizable synthetic methods, and high specific surface area, have emerged as strong candidates for electrode materials. For enhancing the performance, MOFs are commonly compounded with other conducting materials to increase capacitance. This paper provides a detailed analysis of various common preparation strategies and characteristics of MOFs. It summarizes the recent application of MOFs and their derivatives as supercapacitor electrodes alongside other carbon materials, metal compounds, and conductive polymers. Additionally, the challenges encountered by MOFs in the realm of supercapacitor applications are thoroughly discussed. Compared to previous reviews, the content of this paper is more comprehensive, offering readers a deeper understanding of the diverse applications of MOFs. Furthermore, it provides valuable suggestions and guidance for future progress and development in the field of MOFs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 30, May 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state glass nanopipettes, also known as nanopores or nanochannels, are an attractive class of sensing platforms due to their inherent advantages, such as confined space, mechanical stability, and scalable functionalization. By monitoring dynamic switches of surface charge or resistive pulse, various applications have been developed, like biosensors, DNA sequencing, and drug delivery.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state glass nanopipettes provide a promising confined space that offers several advantages such as controllable size, simple preparation, low cost, good mechanical stability, and good thermal stability. These advantages make them an ideal choice for various applications such as biosensors, DNA sequencing, and drug delivery. In this review, we first delve into the functionalized nanopipettes for sensing various analytes and the methods used to develop detection means with them. Next, we provide an in&#8208;depth overview of the advanced functionalization methodologies of nanopipettes based on diversified chemical kinetics. After that, we present the latest state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements and potential applications in detecting a wide range of targets, including ions, molecules, biological macromolecules, and single cells. We examine the various challenges that arise when working with these targets, as well as the innovative solutions developed to overcome them. The final section offers an in&#8208;depth overview of the current development status, newest trends, and application prospects of sensors. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art functionalized nanopipette perception sensing and development of detection means and offers valuable insights into the prospects for this exciting field.

This review discusses strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of intrinsically disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) through genetic fusion with ordered helical or beta sheet domains, aiming to generate well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials on the nanoscale.







Abstract
The unique biophysical and biochemical properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their recombinant derivatives, intrinsically disordered protein polymers (IDPPs) offer opportunities for producing multistimuli&#8208;responsive materials; their sequence&#8208;encoded disorder and tendency for phase separation facilitate the development of multifunctional materials. This review highlights the strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs), and their self&#8208;assembled structures via genetic fusion to ordered motifs such as helical or beta sheet domains. In particular, this review describes approaches that harness the synergistic interplay between order&#8208;promoting and thermoresponsive building blocks to design hybrid biomaterials, resulting in well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials ordered on the nanoscale.

C&#8208;type lectins, a large superfamily of proteins, are crucial in immunity and homeostasis. Their C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain enables them to bind a wide range of ligands, including those not dependent on Ca2+ interactions. This adaptability is further enhanced by their variable domain architecture and conformational plasticity. Secondary binding sites, often located away from the primary site, contribute to the C&#8208;type lectin functional diversity by accommodating different ligands, thus offering potential for drug discovery by fine&#8208;tuning biological responses and increasing selectivity.







Abstract
C&#8208;type lectins are a large superfamily of proteins involved in a multitude of biological processes. In particular, their involvement in immunity and homeostasis has rendered them attractive targets for diverse therapeutic interventions. They share a characteristic C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain whose adaptability enables them to bind a broad spectrum of ligands beyond the originally defined canonical Ca2+&#8208;dependent carbohydrate binding. Together with variable domain architecture and high&#8208;level conformational plasticity, this enables C&#8208;type lectins to meet diverse functional demands. Secondary sites provide another layer of regulation and are often intricately linked to functional diversity. Located remote from the canonical primary binding site, secondary sites can accommodate ligands with other physicochemical properties and alter protein dynamics, thus enhancing selectivity and enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the biological response. In this review, we outline the structural determinants allowing C&#8208;type lectins to perform a large variety of tasks and to accommodate the ligands associated with it. Using the six well&#8208;characterized Ca2+&#8208;dependent and Ca2+&#8208;independent C&#8208;type lectin receptors DC&#8208;SIGN, langerin, MGL, dectin&#8208;1, CLEC&#8208;2 and NKG2D as examples, we focus on the characteristics of non&#8208;canonical interactions and secondary sites and their potential use in drug discovery endeavors.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Benzophenazine Derivatives for Homogeneous and Heterogenized Photooxygenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen is a powerful oxidant used in various applications, such as organic synthesis, medicine, and environmental remediation. Organic and inorganic photosensitizers are commonly used to generate this reactive species through energy transfer with the triplet ground state of oxygen. We describe here a series of novel benzophenazine derivatives as a promising class of photosensitizers for singlet oxygen photosensitization. In this study, we investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of these benzophenazine derivatives. Akin to a molecular compass, the southern fragment was first functionalized with either aromatic tertiary amines, alkyl tertiary amines, aromatic sulfur groups, alkyl sulfur groups, or cyclic ethers. Enhanced photophysical properties (in terms of triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime, absorption wavelength, triplet state energy, and O2 quenching capabilities) were obtained with cyclic ether and sulfur groups. Conversely, the presence of an amine moiety was detrimental to the photocatalysts. The western and northern fragments were also investigated and slightly undesirable to negligible changes in photophysical properties were observed. The most promising candidate was then immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation reaction. These results provide insights into the design of efficient photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation and the development of heterogeneous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and simple mechanical bond strategy can significantly enhance the fluorescence of pyrenes in the solid state with a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect. More importantly, it is found that the originally impure emission of pyrene can be purified to a single emission after the modification of mechanical bond.







Abstract
To address key concerns on solid&#8208;state pyrene&#8208;based luminescent materials, we propose a novel and efficient mechanical bond strategy. This strategy results in a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect and a remarkable enhancement of pyrene emission in the solid state. Moreover, an unusual purification of emission is also achieved. Through computational calculation and experimental characterisation, finally determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we prove that the excellent emissions result from mechanical bond induced refinement of molecular arrangements, including reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, well&#8208;ordered packing and enhanced structural stability. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanical bond in the field of organic luminescent molecules, providing a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nanoparticles to Perform Reactions in Suspension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) are prepared in THF. Based on their high reactivity, they are used as a starting material in the liquid phase for reaction with sterically demanding ligands, resulting in C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions and five novel coordination compounds.







Abstract
Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr2 either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]). [LiBP]&#8208;driven reduction results in smaller Mg(0) nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) than [LiNaph]&#8208;driven reduction (28.5&#177;4&#8197;nm). The as&#8208;prepared Mg(0) nanoparticles are monocrystalline (d101=245&#177;5&#8197;pm) for both types of reduction. Their reactivity is probed by liquid&#8208;phase reaction (THF, toluene) in suspension near room temperature (20&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) with 1&#8208;bromoadamantane (AdBr), chlortriphenylsilane (Ph3SiCl), trichlorphenylsilane (PhSiCl3), 9H&#8208;carbazole (Hcbz), 7&#8208;azaindole (Hai), 1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene (H4nda) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(&#945;&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (H2tpda) as exemplary starting materials. The reactions result in the formation of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biadamantane (1), [MgCl2(thf)2]&#215;Ph6Si2 (2), [Mg9(thf)14Cl18] (3), [Mg(cbz)2(thf)3] (4), [Mg4O(ai)6]&#215;1.5&#8197;C7H8 (5), [Mg4(H2nda)4(thf)4] (6) and [Mg3(tpda)3] (7) with 40&#8211;80&#8201;% yield. 1 and 2 show the reactivity of Mg(0) nanoparticles for C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions with sterically demanding starting materials. 3&#8211;7 represent new coordination compounds using sterically demanding N&#8722;H&#8208;acidic amines as starting materials. The formation of multinuclear Mg2+ complexes with multidentate ligands illustrates the potential of the oxidative approach to obtain novel compounds with Mg(0) nanoparticles in the liquid phase.

         <title>Electrophotocatalysis Versus Indirect Electrolysis: Electrochemical Selenocyclization of 3&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes Facilitated by Energy Transfer, Direct Photolysis or N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new archetypes of electrophotocatalysis, including the first example of energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;involved photo/electro dual catalysis and the direct photolysis&#8208;involved one, as well as a NHPI&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical selenocyclization, are presented. These catalytic platforms enable direct syntheses of seleno 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 1,5&#8208;dienes with broad substrate scopes in a mild, clean, Se&#8208;economic, regioselective and oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free manner.







Abstract
Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The two electrophotocatalytic reactions and the indirect electrolysis one are both regioselective and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208; and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and are associated with a broad substrate scope and high Se&#8208;economy, and all three methods are amenable to gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, sunlight&#8208;induced experiments and all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven syntheses.

     alt="Electrophotocatalysis Versus Indirect Electrolysis: Electrochemical Selenocyclization of 3-Aza-1,5-dienes Facilitated by Energy Transfer, Direct Photolysis or N-Hydroxyphthalimide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new archetypes of electrophotocatalysis, including the first example of energy-transfer-involved photo/electro dual catalysis and the direct photolysis-involved one, as well as a NHPI-catalyzed electrochemical selenocyclization, are presented. These catalytic platforms enable direct syntheses of seleno 4-pyrrolin-2-ones from 1,5-dienes with broad substrate scopes in a mild, clean, Se-economic, regioselective and oxidant- and metal-free manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3-aza-1,5-dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3-selenomethyl-4-pyrrolin-2-ones. The two electrophotocatalytic reactions and the indirect electrolysis one are both regioselective and external-oxidant- and transition-metal-free, and are associated with a broad substrate scope and high Se-economy, and all three methods are amenable to gram-scale syntheses, late-stage functionalizations, sunlight-induced experiments and all-solar-driven syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Application of Mono and Trinuclear Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complexes in Differential Bacterial Imaging and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent transition metal complexes act as potential photosensitizers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial infection. We designed luminescent mono and trinuclear cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for bacterial imaging and antibacterial activity against Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), L. lactis, C. jejuni, and E. coli. Trinuclear Ir (III) complex unveiled more excellent phototherapeutic antibacterial activity against MRSA. These complexes could be valuable candidates for fighting bacterial infections effectively.







Abstract
The application of transition metal complexes for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an attractive alternative in mitigating a broad range of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In view of their photostability, long excited&#8208;state lifetimes, and tunable emission properties, transition metal complexes also contribute as bioimaging agents. In the present work, we designed mono and trinuclear cyclometalated iridium (III) complexes to explore their imaging application and antibacterial potential. For this, we used Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the most prevalent of community&#8208;associated (CA) multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria (CA MDR) and Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) as Gram&#8208;positive while Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and E. coli as Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In addition to differential bioimaging of these bacteria, we assessed the antibacterial effects of both mono and trinuclear Ir(III) complexes under exposure to 427&#8197;nm LED light. The data presented herein strongly suggest better efficacy of trinuclear Ir(III) complex over the mononuclear complex in imparting photoinduced cell death of MRSA. Based on the safety profile of these complexes, we propose that trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complex holds great promise for selective recognition and targeting MDR bacteria with minimal off&#8208;target effect.

         <title>Sustainable Electrolytes: Design Principles and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive research has focused on optimizing the solvation structure, including salt, solvent, additive, or concentration, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of high&#8208;performance, safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable electrolytes.







Abstract
Today, rechargeable batteries are omnipresent and essential for our existence. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of electric fields, the introduction of electrolytes with fluorine (F)&#8208;based inorganic elemental compositions is a direction of exploration. However, most fluorocarbons have a high global warming potential and ozone depletion potential, which do not meet the sustainability requirements of the battery industry. Therefore, developing sustainable electrolytes is a viable option for future battery development. Although researchers have made much progress in electrolyte optimization, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. This review aims to elucidate the design principles and recent advances in this direction for solvents and salts. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of green electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage rechargeable batteries.

         <title>High Pressure Promotes Binding of the Allosteric Inhibitor Zn2+&#8208;Cyclen in Crystals of Activated H&#8208;Ras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High pressure induces in the crystal of Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp, which is in the dominant state 2 conformation, a transition to a transient state where the Zn2+&#8208;cyclen molecule, which is an allosteric inhibitor targeting the state 1, can bind.







Abstract
In this work, we experimentally investigate the potency of high pressure to drive a protein toward an excited state where an inhibitor targeted for this state can bind. Ras proteins are small GTPases cycling between active GTP&#8208;bound and inactive GDP&#8208;bound states. Various states of GTP&#8208;bound Ras in active conformation coexist in solution, amongst them, state 2 which binds to effectors, and state 1, weakly populated at ambient conditions, which has a low affinity for effectors. Zn2+&#8208;cyclen is an allosteric inhibitor of Ras protein, designed to bind specifically to the state 1. In H&#8208;Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp crystals soaked with Zn2+&#8208;cyclen, no binding could be observed, as expected in the state 2 conformation which is the dominant state at ambient pressure. Interestingly, Zn2+&#8208;cyclen binding is observed at 500&#8197;MPa pressure, close to the nucleotide, in Ras protein that is driven by pressure to a state 1 conformer. The unknown binding mode of Zn2+&#8208;cyclen to H&#8208;Ras can thus be fully characterized in atomic details. As a more general conjunction from our study, high pressure x&#8208;ray crystallography turns out to be a powerful method to induce transitions allowing drug binding in proteins that are in low&#8208;populated conformations at ambient conditions, enabling the design of specific inhibitors.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Detection and Idiosyncratic Removal of Copper by Nano&#8208;Particle Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a cost&#8208;effective, environmentally benign calcium&#8208;MOF has been synthesized by microwave irradiation, having selective and reusable copper detection and removal capability from wastewater. This material, upon interaction with copper solution, undergoes a color change from yellow to reddish with a detection limit of&#8805;5&#8197;ppm and has a removal capacity of 484.2&#177;30&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 that adsorbed copper as copper oxide nanoparticles.







Abstract
A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CaMOF@LSB) was designed and synthesized, exhibiting dual functionality for both selective detection and removal of Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. The framework&#8216;s stability, including solvent and pH variations, was established with notable thermal resilience. Colorimetric Cu2+ detection (&#8805;5&#8197;ppm) with a high capture capacity of 484.2&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 by CaMOF@LSB places this material among the few that ensure efficient colorimetric detection and high removal capabilities of Cu2+ ions. Batch adsorption experiments revealed pH&#8208;dependent behavior and competitive interactions. Langmuir and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetics models aptly described adsorption isotherms and kinetics, respectively. Thermodynamic assessments confirmed spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Mechanistically, nanoparticle deposition contributes to the Cu2+ uptake. CaMOF@LSB also exhibited one of the best removal behaviour of Cu2+ by means of oxide formation on the surface. Regeneration of CaMOF@LSB was achieved by simple sonication in 0.1&#8197;M aqueous NaOH solution. The recyclability was also tested up to 5 cycles, and it exhibited a small decrease in adsorption capacity observed across the cycles. This research presents a promising avenue for addressing heavy metal pollution using metal&#8208;organic frameworks, thereby offering potential applications in water purification and environmental pollution monitoring and remediation.

         <title>Understanding Flexdispersion: Structure&#8208;Function Relationship Studies of Organic Amphiphilic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8722;function relationship studies were carried out to understand the ability of amphiphilic ligands to disperse nanoparticles. Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements clearly showed that the arrangement of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains influenced the dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in various organic solvents, including toluene (a less polar solvent) and methanol (a polar solvent).







Abstract
Since inorganic nanoparticles have unique properties that differ from those of bulk materials, their material applications have attracted attention in various fields. In order to utilize inorganic nanoparticles for functional materials, they must be dispersed without agglomeration. Therefore, the surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles are typically modified with organic ligands to improve their dispersibility. Nevertheless, the relationship between the tail group structure in organic ligands and the dispersibility of inorganic nanoparticles in organic solvents remains poorly understood. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. However, the structural requirements for amphiphilic ligands to &#8220;flexibly&#8221; disperse nanoparticles in less polar to polar solvents are still unclear. Here, we designed and synthesized several phosphonic acid ligands for structure&#8722;function relationship studies of flexdispersion. Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements revealed that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains in organic ligands alone does not determine the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in organic solvents, but the arrangement of the individual chains also has an effect. From a practical application standpoint, it is preferable to design ligands with ethylene glycol chains on the outside relative to the particle surface.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Photoexcitation of Aqueous Urea Forms Carbamic Acid/Carbamate in Less Than One Picosecond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the photochemistry of aqueous urea under 200&#8197;nm UV irradiation. Besides a low extinction coefficient &#8211; intramolecular vibrational coupling and effective energy dissipation through the water network significantly reduce photodissociation probabilities in contrast to the results of UV photolysis of anhydrous urea in noble gas matrices. The reults underscore the protective role of water in prebiotic chemistry and suggest a unique pathway for the formation of key feedstock molecules in the absence of biological catalysts like urease.







Abstract
Urea is believed to have been essential to the synthesis of prebiotic nucleotides and thereby the RNA or DNA of the first lifeforms. Models suggesting that life began in wet&#8208;dry cycles around shallow aquatic ponds imply that reactants such as urea were exposed to deep ultraviolet irradiation from the young sun. Detrimental photodissociation of urea induced by deep UV excitation potentially challenges these models. We here follow the primary deep ultraviolet photochemistry of aqueous urea. The data show that urea is barely excited at 200&#8197;nm due to weak ultraviolet absorption. The likelihood of photodissociation is further reduced by strong intra&#8208;molecular coupling of the CN and CO stretch vibrations accompanied by an efficient dissipation of the excitation energy to the surrounding water molecules mitigated by urea&#8208;water hydrogen bonds. We find that 54&#177;5&#8201;% of the excited urea molecules dissociate. Reactions between the photoproducts and surrounding solvent molecules form carbamic acid or the carbamate anions within 0.6&#8197;ps. The molecules that do not dissociate return to the electronic ground state in 2&#8197;ps. Interestingly, the photodissociation processes of urea in the aqueous phase is different from earlier reported reactions observed following the VUV photolysis of urea in noble gas matrices and highlight the potential influence of water on the prebiotic photochemistry.

         <title>The Characterization of Multifaceted PREP1 Peptides Provides Insights into Correlations between Spectroscopic and Structural Properties of Amyloid&#8208;like Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The characterization of an amyloid&#8208;like cross&#8208;&#946; peptide demonstrates that it can emit visible fluorescence with unusual redshifts via a Foster resonance electron transfer (FRET) phenomenon and highlights interesting correlations between structural and spectroscopic properties.







Abstract
The widespread ability of proteins and peptides to self&#8208;assemble by forming cross&#8208;&#946; structure is one of the most significant discoveries in structural biology. Intriguingly, the cross&#8208;&#946; association of proteins/peptides may generate intricate supramolecular architectures with uncommon spectroscopic properties. We have recently characterized self&#8208;assembled peptides extracted from the PREP1 protein that are endowed with interesting structural/spectroscopic properties. We here demonstrate that the green fluorescence emission of the peptide PREP1[117&#8208;132] (&#955;em ~520&#8197;nm), can be induced by excitation with UV radiation. The associated unusually large Stokes shift (&#916;&#955; ~150&#8197;nm) represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of an internal resonance energy transfer in amyloid&#8208;like structures, where the blue emission of some assemblies becomes the excitation radiation for others. Moreover, the characterization of PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants provides insights into the sequence/structure and structure/spectroscopic properties relationships. Our data suggests that the green fluorescence is plausibly associated with antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet states of the peptide whereas parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are only endowed with blue fluorescence. Notably, the different PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants also form assemblies characterized by distinct morphologies. Indeed, the parent peptide and single mutants form compact but structured aggregates whereas most of the double mutants exhibit elongated and highly extended fibers.

         <title>Efficient Blue Photo&#8208; and Electroluminescence from CF3&#8208;Decorated Cu(I) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide complexes are developed by using CF3&#8208;decorated carbazole ligands. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes deliver pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence and a high external quantum efficiency.







Abstract
Luminescent organometallic complexes of earth&#8208;abundant copper(I) have long been studied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). Particularly, Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have recently emerged as promising organometallic emitters. However, blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA complexes have been rarely reported. Here we constructed two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA emitters, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz and MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz, by introducing one or two CF3 substitutes into carbazole ligands. Both complexes exhibited high thermal stability and blue emission colors. Moreover, two complexes exhibited different emission origins rooting from different donor ligands: a distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz or a dominant phosphorescence nature from local triplet excited state of the carbazole ligand for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz. Inspiringly, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz had high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 94&#8201;% and short emission lifetimes of down to 1.2&#8197;&#956;s in doped films, accompanied by relatively high radiative rates in the 105&#8197;s&#8722;1 order. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz delivered pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 462&#8197;nm together with a high external quantum efficiency of 13.0&#8201;%.

         <title>Molybdenum Sulfide Nanoflowers as Electrodes for Efficient and Scalable Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanoflowers exhibit a highly efficient and stable performance in lithium&#8208;ion capacitors with an ether&#8208;based electrolyte. This is due to the fast surface redox reactions, particularly the intercalation/deintercalation pseudocapacitive mechanism enabled by nanostructuring and synergistic 2D features of MoS2. Tailoring the extrinsic features (shape and dimensions) serves as a potential path to overcome sluggish kinetics often observed in lithium&#8208;ion capacitors.







Abstract
Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) bridge the unique advantages of batteries and capacitors and are considered promising energy storage devices for hybrid vehicles and other electronic gadgets. Lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) have attained particular interest due to their higher energy and power density than traditional supercapacitor devices. The limited voltage window and the deterioration of anode materials upsurged the demand for efficient and stable electrode materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is a promising candidate for developing efficient and durable LICs due to its wide lithiation potential and unique layer structure, enhancing charge storage efficiency. Modifying the extrinsic features, such as the dimensions and shape at the nanoscale, serves as a potential path to overcome the sluggish kinetics observed in the LICs. Herein, the MoS2 nanoflowers have been synthesized through a hydrothermal route. The developed LIC exhibited a specific capacitance of 202.4&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and capacitance retention of &gt;90&#8201;% over 5,000 cycles. Using an ether electrolyte improved the voltage window (2.0&#8197;V) and enhanced the stability performance. The ex&#8208;situ material characterization after the stability test reveals that the storage mechanism in MoS2&#8208;LICs is not diffusion&#8208;controlled. Instead, the fast surface redox reactions, especially intercalation/deintercalation of ions, are more prominent for charge storage.

This is due to the fast surface redox reactions, particularly the intercalation/deintercalation pseudocapacitive mechanism enabled by nanostructuring and synergistic 2D features of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; Tailoring the extrinsic features (shape and dimensions) serves as a potential path to overcome sluggish kinetics often observed in lithium-ion capacitors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) bridge the unique advantages of batteries and capacitors and are considered promising energy storage devices for hybrid vehicles and other electronic gadgets. Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) have attained particular interest due to their higher energy and power density than traditional supercapacitor devices. The limited voltage window and the deterioration of anode materials upsurged the demand for efficient and stable electrode materials. Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a promising candidate for developing efficient and durable LICs due to its wide lithiation potential and unique layer structure, enhancing charge storage efficiency. Modifying the extrinsic features, such as the dimensions and shape at the nanoscale, serves as a potential path to overcome the sluggish kinetics observed in the LICs. Herein, the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers have been synthesized through a hydrothermal route. The developed LIC exhibited a specific capacitance of 202.4&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and capacitance retention of &amp;gt;90&#8201;% over 5,000 cycles. Using an ether electrolyte improved the voltage window (2.0&#8197;V) and enhanced the stability performance. The &lt;i&gt;ex-situ&lt;/i&gt; material characterization after the stability test reveals that the storage mechanism in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-LICs is not diffusion-controlled. Instead, the fast surface redox reactions, especially intercalation/deintercalation of ions, are more prominent for charge storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alared: Solvatochromic and Fluorogenic Red Amino Acid for Ratiometric Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Bioactive Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we introduce Alared, solvatochromic and fluorogenic red fluorescent amino acid which can be easily integrated into bioactive peptides using classical solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The emission color and the quantum yield of Alared vary in a broad range depending on the peptide microenvironment, making Alared a powerful reporter of biomolecular interactions in living cells.







Abstract
To fill the need for environmentally sensitive fluorescent unnatural amino acids able to operate in the red region of the spectrum, we have designed and synthesized Alared, a red solvatochromic and fluorogenic amino acid derived from the Nile Red chromophore. The new unnatural amino acid can be easily integrated into bioactive peptides using classical solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The fluorescence quantum yield and the emission maximum of Alared&#8208;labeled peptides vary in a broad range depending on the peptide's environment, making Alared a powerful reporter of biomolecular interactions. Due to its red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra, Alared&#8208;labeled peptides could be followed in living cells with minimal interference from cellular autofluorescence. Using ratiometric fluorescence microscopy, we were able to track the fate of the Alared&#8208;labeled peptide agonists of the apelin G protein&#8208;coupled receptor upon receptor activation and internalization. Due to its color&#8208;shifting environmentally sensitive emission, Alared allowed for distinguishing the fractions of peptides that are specifically bound to the receptor or unspecifically bound to different cellular membranes.

         <title>Impact of Single Acyclic Phosphonate Nucleotide (ZNA) Modifications on DNA Duplex Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dickerson Drew dodecamers (DDDs) with either a single (R) or (S) modified acyclic phosphate nucleotide (ZNA) at position 9 were synthesized and the influence of such modification was evaluated by NMR spectroscopy. The presence of a ZNA modification affected the hairpin&#8208;duplex interconversion of DDD DNA, with (S)&#8208;ZNA producing a more pronounced destabilizing effect on the DDD duplex structure than (R)&#8208;ZNA.







Abstract
An acyclic phosphonate&#8208;linked nucleic acid backbone (ZNA) demonstrated the capability to support duplex formation and propagate genetic information in&#8197;vivo, unveiling its potential for evolution into a synthetic genetic system (XNA). To determine the structural impact of such modification, modified Dickerson Drew DNA dodecamers (DDDs) were prepared by solid phase synthesis, each containing either an (R) or (S) isomeric form of a cytosine ZNA nucleotide. While the DDD is known to adopt a stable duplex, both duplex and hairpin forms were simultaneously observed for both modified oligonucleotides by NMR spectroscopy over a broad temperature range (5&#8211;65&#8201;&#176;C). Diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments allowed to separate duplex and hairpin signals based on the different diffusion constants of both conformational states. For the oligomer containing (R)&#8208;ZNA, only the duplex form occurred at 5&#8201;&#176;C, while it was not possible to determine by NMR a single hairpin conformation at higher temperatures. In the case of the (S)&#8208;ZNA nucleoside modified oligomer, both hairpin and duplex forms were observable at 0&#8201;&#176;C, while a single hairpin conformation was detected at 37&#8201;&#176;C, suggesting a higher destabilizing effect on dsDNA.

         <title>Azophosphines: Synthesis, Structure and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional groups are fundamentally important for synthetic chemists and enable rational understanding of reactivity. Azophosphines are underexplored compounds that are heavier congeners of triazenes, and we have devised a general synthesis to this family of compounds. The availability of the phosphorus lone pair enabled them to be used as ligands that can bind in different coordination modes in a controlled manner.







Abstract
The conceptual replacement of nitrogen with phosphorus in common organic functional groups unlocks new properties and reactivity. The phosphorus&#8208;containing analogues of triazenes are underexplored but offer great potential as flexible and small bite&#8208;angle ligands. This manuscript explores the synthesis and characterisation of a family of air&#8208;stable azophosphine&#8208;borane complexes, and their subsequent deprotection to the free azophosphines. These compounds are structurally characterised, both experimentally and computationally, and highlight the availability of the phosphorus lone pair for coordination. This is confirmed by demonstrating that neutral azophosphines can act as ligands in Ru complexes, and can coordinate as monodentate or bidentate ligands in a controlled manner, in contrast to their nitrogen analogues.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Chirality in Inorganic Crystals: From Construction to Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and electronic chirality in inorganic crystals from conceptualization to practical applications is described in this work. Chirality can be engineered across various scales, ranging from macrostructures down to atomic arrangements and even individual electrons. The interplay between structural and electronic chirality not only facilitates the design of highly efficient devices and chemical reactions but also offers insights into the origins of life. For further details, see the Review authored by W. Li, G. Li, and their collaborators (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400436).

         <title>Aggregation of N&#8208;Heteropolycyclic Aromatic Molecules: The Acridine Dimer and Trimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their nitrogen&#8208;substituted analogues are of great interest for various applications in organic electronics. The performance of such devices is determined not only by the properties of the single molecules, but also by the structure of their aggregates, which often form via self&#8208;aggregation. Gaining insight into such aggregation processes is a challenging task, but crucial for a fine&#8208;tuning of the materials properties. In this work, an efficient approach for the generation and characterisation of aggregates is described, based on matrix&#8208;isolation experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. This approach is exemplified for aggregation of acridine. The acridine dimer and trimer are thoroughly analysed on the basis of experimental and calculated UV and IR absorption spectra, which
agree well with each other. Thereby a novel structure of the acridine dimer is found, which disagrees with a previously reported one. The calculations also show the changes from excitonic coupling towards orbital interactions between two molecules with decreasing distance to each other. In addition, a structure of the trimer is determined. Finally, an outlook is given on how even higher aggregates can be made accessible through experiment.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;ESIPT Photoluminescent Probe Based on 3&#8208;(3&#8208;Hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol for the Detection of Intracellular Hydrogen Peroxide</title>

         <dc:description>Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules, which feature large Stokes shifts to avoid self&#8208;absorption, play an essential role in photoluminescent bioimaging probes. Herein, we report the development of an ESIPT molecule 3&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol (PiQ).&#160;PiQ&#160;not only undergoes a distinct ESIPT process unlike the symmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;diol but also exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#160;characteristics. PiQ&#160;self&#8208;assembles into aggregates with an average size of 241.0 &#177; 51.9 nm in aqueous solutions, leading to significantly enhanced photoluminescence. On the basis of the ESIPT and AIE characteristics of&#160;PiQ, the latter is functionalized with a hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive 4&#8208;pinacoratoborylbenzyl group (B) and a carboxylesterase&#8208;responsive acetyl group (A) to produce a photoluminescent probe&#160;B&#8208;PiQ&#8208;A. The potential of&#160;PiQ&#160;for applications in bioimaging and chemical sensing is underscored by its efficient detection of both endogenous and exogenous hydrogen peroxide in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational and Substitution Effects on the Donor and Reducing Strength of Tin(II) Porphyrinogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Meso&#8208;octaalkylcalix[4]pyrrolates are a class of redox&#8208;active porphyrinogen ligands. They have been well established in d&#8208; and f&#8208;block chemistry for over three decades but have only recently been introduced as ligands for p&#8208;block elements. Here, we present a study on the influence of meso&#8208;substituents on the redox chemistry of calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) dianions [2R]2&#8722; (R = Me, Et). Expansion of the normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) method, well known for porphyrin chemistry, provides insights into the ligand conformation of a calix[4]pyrrolato p&#8208;block complex. Combined with the results of spectroscopic donor scaling, electrochemical studies, and quantum mechanical bond analysis tools, subtle but significant substitution and conformational effects on the electronic structure are revealed. Exploiting this knowledge rationalizes the role of this class of tin(II) dianions to act as potent reducing agents, but can also be expanded for other central elements. Photoexcitation boosts this reactivity further, allowing for the reduction of even challenging chlorobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of discrete multi&#8208;chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of chromophoric systems is a prerequisite to create well&#8208;ordered, processable nanomaterials with multiple functionalities. In the past two decades, the field of functional organic materials has primarily focused on systems featuring only one type of dye/&#960;&#8208;conjugated unit. Consequently, many reports with mechanistic insights on the self&#8208;assembly of the dyes featuring different molecular packing have been reported. Subsequently, we have witnessed several attempts to organize the multi&#8208;chromophoric systems in solution and solid&#8208;state via different approaches using self&#8208;assembly as a tool. Incorporation of more than one dye is important in creating materials with tuneable optoelectronic properties. Consequently, self&#8208;assembly of more than one chromophoric systems have been investigated to some extent. This review aims to discuss the self&#8208;assembled materials derived from discrete &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems comprising more than one dye units connected through covalent bonding (multi&#8208;chromophoric systems). Molecular design of various multi&#8208;chromophoric systems leading to the formation of crystals, liquid crystals and supramolecular polymers have been correlated with corresponding properties. We envisage that classification of self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;chromophoric systems, with a note on tuneable optoelectronic properties, can provide a deeper understanding on the molecular design strategies, which is important in the fabrication of functional organic materials with optimum performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Transition Control in Molecular Solids via Complementarity of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase transitions in molecular solids involve synergistic changes in chemical and electronic structures, leading to diversification in physical and chemical properties. Despite the pivotal role of hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in many phase&#8208;transition materials, it is rare and challenging to chemically regulate the dynamics and to elucidate the structure&#8208;property relationship. Here, four high&#8208;spin CoII&#160;com&#8208;pounds were isolated and systematically investigated by modifying the ligand terminal groups (X = S, Se) and substituents (Y = Cl, Br).&#160;S&#8208;Cl&#160;and&#160;Se&#8208;Br&#160;undergo a reversible structural phase transition near room temperature, triggering the rotation of 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 guests and the swing between syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation of NCX&#8722;&#160;ligands, accompanied by switchable magnetism. Conversely,&#160;S&#8208;Br&#160;and&#160;Se&#8208;Cl&#160;retain stability in ordered and disordered phases, respectively. H&#8208;bonds geometric analysis and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations reveal that the electronegativity of X and Y affects the strength of NY&#8208;ap&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;X interactions. Entropy&#8208;driven structural phase transitions occur when the H&#8208;bond strength is appropriate; otherwise, the phase stays unchanged if it is too strong or weak. This work highlights a phase transition driven by H&#8208;bond strength complementarity &#8211; pairing strong acceptor with weak donor and&#160;vice versa, which offers a straightforward and effective approach for designing phase&#8208;transition molecular solids from a chemical perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Prebiotic Formation of Peptides Through Bubbling and Arc Plasma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abiotic synthesis of peptides, widely regarded as one of the key chemical reactions on the prebiotic Earth, is thermodynamically constrained in solution. Herein, a simulation of the lightning phenomenon on the sea surface using bubble bursting and arc plasma under ambient conditions enables dipeptide formation of six amino acids with conversion ratios ranging from 2.6% to 25.5%. Additionally, we observed the formation of biologically active tripeptides and investigated the stereoselectivity of the dipeptide formation reaction. By utilizing a mixture of 20 amino acids in the reaction, 102 possible dipeptides were generated. These results establish experimental constructions to mimic achievable prebiotic conditions and provide a credible pathway for endogenous biopolymer synthesis on prebiotic Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>O/S&#160;Exchange Reaction in Synthesizing Sulfur&#8208;Containing Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using carbon disulfide (CS2) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) as sulfur&#8208;containing and one&#8208;carbon feedstocks to make value&#8208;added products is paramount for both pure and applied chemistry and environmental science. One of the practical strategies is to copolymerize these bulk chemicals with epoxides to produce sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. This approach contributes to improving the sustainability of polymer manufacturing, provides highly desired functional polymer materials, and has attracted much attention. However, these copolymerizations invariably exhibit the intensely complicated chemistry of O/S exchange reaction, leading to sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with diverse architectures. As the understanding of O/S exchange continues to deepen, recent efforts have guided significant advances in the synthesis of CS2&#8208; and COS&#8208;based polymers. This review examines the O/S exchange chemistry and summarizes the recent progress in this field to promote the further advance of synthesizing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers from CS2 and COS.</dc:description>

         <title>Postsynthetic Modification of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks have garnered significant attention due to their flexible structures&#160;with tailored&#160;porosity, making them a promising class of&#160;porous&#160;framework materials. However, the direct synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks&#160;with specific functions&#160;is highly challenging due to the unpredictable formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks. In response, postsynthetic modification has emerged as a potent strategy to imbue desired functions into hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks.&#160;Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of postsynthetic modification in hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for studying&#160;their mechanical, luminescent, electrochemical, and chiral properties. In this concept, we comprehensively summarize the methodologies and outcomes of postsynthetic modification to hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, providing a&#160;highlight&#160;of this exciting&#160;research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed Mannosylerythritol Lipid Analogues Exhibiting both Selective Cytotoxicity against Human Skin Cancer Cells and Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are a class of amphipathic molecules bearing&#160;a hydrophilic 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol skeleton. Here, we designed and synthesized four kinds of MEL analogues R&#8208;MEL&#8208;A ([2R,3S]&#8208;erythritol type), S&#8208;mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)&#8208;A ([2S,3S]&#8208;threitol type), R&#8208;MTL&#8208;A ([2R,3R]&#8208;threitol type), and &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;MEL&#8208;A ([2S,3R]&#8208;erythritol type) using our previously reported boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) method and a neighboring group assisted glycosylation method. The selective cytotoxicity of the target compounds against cancer cells was evaluated, with R&#8208;MTL&#8208;A showing the highest selective cytotoxicity against human skin squamous carcinoma HSC&#8208;5 cells. Our findings suggest that R&#8208;MTL&#8208;A induces necrosis&#8208;like cell death against HSC&#8208;5 cells by decreasing cell membrane fluidity. R&#8208;MTL&#8208;A also exhibits an efficient recovery effect on damaged skin cells, indicating that R&#8208;MTL&#8208;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals with both cancer cell&#8208;selective toxicity and recovery effects on damaged skin cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dihydrobenzofurans, Dihydrobenzosulfones, and Dihydroindoles by Merging One&#8208;pot Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Matsuda Reactions from Anilines with Redox&#8208;Relay Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot tandem process was developed aiming at the concise and expeditious enantioselective synthesis of dihydrobenzofuran, dihydrobenzosulfone, and dihydroindole scaffolds under mild, and open&#8208;flask conditions. This process combines the in situ generation of aryldiazonium salt directly from the anilines in methanol telescoped to an intramolecular Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction linked to a redox relay process to provide the final products as the dimethyl acetals. These Heck products were smoothly converted into the corresponding primary alcohols or esters. The robustness and the efficiency of the protocol are demonstrated by the synthesis of 24 enantioenriched dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrobenzosulfones, and dihydroindoles in overall yields up to 78% in enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1 by a sequential 5&#8208;step protocol..</dc:description>

         <title>Applications of metals and metal compounds in improving the sensitivity of microfluidic biosensors &#8208; a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement of detection sensitivity in microfluidic sensors has been a continuously explored field. Initially, many strategies for sensitivity improvement involved introducing enzyme cascade reactions, but enzyme&#8208;based reactions posed challenges in terms of cost, stability, and storage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore enzyme&#8208;free cascade amplification methods, which are crucial for expanding the application range and improving detection stability. Metal or metal compound nanomaterials have gained great attention in the exploitation of microfluidic sensors due to their ease of preparation, storage, and lower cost. The unique physical properties of metallic nanomaterials, including surface plasmon resonance, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption, contribute significantly to enhancing detection capabilities. The metal&#8208;based catalytic nanomaterials, exemplified by Fe3O4 nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are considered viable alternatives to biological enzymes due to their excellent performance. Herein, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of metals and metal compounds in improving the sensitivity of microfluidic biosensors. This review not only highlights the current developments but also critically analyzes the challenges encountered in this field. Furthermore, it outlines potential directions for future research, contributing to the ongoing development of microfluidic biosensors with improved detection sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sodium Bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI)&#8208;based Multifunctional Electrolyte Stabilizes the Performance of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2/hard carbon Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI)&#8208;based multifunctional electrolyte is developed by partially replacing NaPF6 salt in the electrolyte to improve the wide temperature range working capability of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2/hard carbon (NNFM111/HC) sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity retention of the SIBs with NaFSI&#8208;NaPF6 dual salt electrolyte increases from 47.2% to 75.5% after 250 cycles at 25 oC, and from 51.0% to 82.3% after 80 cycles at 45 oC, and the 1 C discharge capacity retention at the low temperature of &#8208;20 oC also increases 26.8%. In the single salt system, NaPF6 effectively passivate the aluminum foil and NaFSI passivate the electrode/electrolyte interface. The synergistic effect of NaPF6 and NaFSI greatly improves the battery performance in a wide temperature range. This NaFSI&#8208;based dual salt electrolyte also effectively overcomes the flaws when the SIBs using NaFSI or NaPF6 independently, and makes it more suitable for SIBs, indicating promising prospects in the commercial application of NNFM111/HC SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering Factors Controlling Reactivity of Metal&#8208;TEMPO Reaction Systems in the Solid State and Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroxides find application in various areas of chemistry, and a more in&#8208;depth understanding of factors controlling their reactivity with metal complexes is warranted to promote further developments. Here, we report on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on both the distribution of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;centered spin density in 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) and turning TEMPO from the O&#8208; to N&#8208;radical mode scavenger in metal&#8208;TEMPO systems. We use Et(Cl)Zn/TEMPO model reaction system with tuneable reactivity in the solid state and solution. Among various products, a unique Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct of Cl2Zn with the N&#8208;ethylated TEMPO was isolated and structurally characterised, and the so&#8208;called solid&#8208;state 'slow chemistry' reaction led to a higher yield of the N&#8208;alkylated product. The revealed structure&#8208;activity/selectivity correlations are exceptional yet are entirely rationalised by the mechanistic underpinning supported by theoretical calculations of studied model systems. This work lays a foundation and mechanistic blueprint for future metal/nitroxide systems exploration.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence and Lifetime Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Polarity Change During Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probe, SBD&#8722;CH, was developed. By combining confocal laser scanning microscopy with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it revealed an increased and more dispersed ER polarity during ferroptosis. The common ferroptosis inhibitor Fer&#8208;1 could only partially reduce the polarity of ER, but did not restore the dispersion loss of ER membrane.







Abstract
As a new form of regulated cell death, ferroptosis is closely related to various diseases. Tracing ferroptosis related biological behavior is helpful to better understand this process and its related biology. Considering that ferroptosis is featured with remarkable lipid peroxidation which can easily change the membranes&#8217; compositions and structures, it is potential to detect intracellular environmental changes for direct assessment of ferroptosis. In view of the close relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ferroptosis, we designed an ER&#8208;targeted and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probe SBD&#8722;CH, which has superior photostability and can respond to polarity with high selectivity without the affection of viscosity. SBD&#8722;CH can monitor the trend of ER polarity during ferroptosis by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and analyze the distribution of polarity in ferroptosis by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). During Erastin induced ferroptosis, the polarity of ER in HT&#8208;1080 cells increased and the polarity distribution in ER was more dispersed. Our work provides an effective strategy for evaluating the process of ferroptosis by monitoring the changes of ER polarity.

&lt;p&gt;An endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted and polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe, &lt;b&gt;SBD&#8722;CH&lt;/b&gt;, was developed. By combining confocal laser scanning microscopy with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it revealed an increased and more dispersed ER polarity during ferroptosis. The common ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 could only partially reduce the polarity of ER, but did not restore the dispersion loss of ER membrane.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new form of regulated cell death, ferroptosis is closely related to various diseases. Tracing ferroptosis related biological behavior is helpful to better understand this process and its related biology. Considering that ferroptosis is featured with remarkable lipid peroxidation which can easily change the membranes&#8217; compositions and structures, it is potential to detect intracellular environmental changes for direct assessment of ferroptosis. In view of the close relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ferroptosis, we designed an ER-targeted and polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe &lt;b&gt;SBD&#8722;CH&lt;/b&gt;, which has superior photostability and can respond to polarity with high selectivity without the affection of viscosity. &lt;b&gt;SBD&#8722;CH&lt;/b&gt; can monitor the trend of ER polarity during ferroptosis by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and analyze the distribution of polarity in ferroptosis by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Thermal Equilibrium Between Quinoid/Biradical Forms Enhancing Electrochemical Amphotericity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;shell biradical form, which is generated by a thermal equilibrium with the closed&#8208;shell quinoid form in solution, exhibits electrochemical amphotericity. For the biradicals, since two radical units behave independently upon electron transfer, both oxidation and reduction proceed in two&#8208;electron processes. As a result, these biradicals show an exceptionally small difference between second oxidation and second reduction potentials.







Abstract
Upon dibenzo annulation on Thiele's hydrocarbon (tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethane), the quinoid form and the biradical form adopt quite different geometries, and thus are no longer resonance structures. When these two forms can interconvert rapidly due to the small energy barrier (&#916;G&#8800;), the equilibrated mixture contains both forms in a ratio that is determined by the energy difference (&#916;Go) between the two forms. For a series of tetrakis[5&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl]&#8208;substituted derivatives, the more stable quinoid form and the metastable biradical form coexist in solution as an equilibrated mixture due to small &#916;G&#8800; (&lt;15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and &#916;Go (1&#8211;4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), in which the proportion of the two forms can be regulated by temperature. Since the biradical form can undergo easy two&#8208;electron (2e) oxidation to the corresponding dications as well as easy 2e&#8208;reduction to the dianions, it exhibits very high electrochemical amphotericity. This character with a record&#8208;small span for not only the first oxidation and reduction potentials but also the second those, [E1sum&#8776;E2sum=E2ox&#8722;E2red=ca. 1.4&#8197;V], is attained through thermally enhanced conversion to the biradical form from the corresponding quinoid form, the latter of which is less amphoteric due to higher Eox and lower Ered values.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP), the Friedel&#8211;Crafts type cyclobutenylation reaction of several (hetero)aromatic compounds was smoothly proceeded by using gem&#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes as easily available sources of cyclobutenyl cations.







Abstract
In 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP), gem&#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes, which can be prepared by the (2+2) cycloaddition reaction of Tf2C=CH2 with alkynes, underwent desulfination to generate the corresponding cyclobutenyl cation. This unique reactivity was successfully applied to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts type cyclobutenylation reaction of several (hetero)aromatic compounds.

         <dc:description>
A domino reaction featuring C&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;N coupling condenses ortho&#8208;fluorotoluenes and imines to give non fully aromatic indoline cores, that are not readily available by standard methods. Neither transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysts nor high pressure conditions are required for this straightforward, base&#8208;mediated synthesis.







Abstract
Syntheses of (partially) aromatic nitrogen heterocycles increasingly rely on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;C&#8208; and C&#8722;N&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here we describe a different approach to the synthesis of indolines by a domino C(sp3)&#8722;H activation, 1,2&#8208;addition, and defluorinative SNAr&#8208;cyclization sequence to provide the target 1,2&#8208;diarylindolines (1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) from ortho&#8208;fluorinated methyl&#8208;arenes and N&#8208;aryl imines (benzylidene anilines) in a cyclocondensation that is mediated by potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) as base exclusively. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process via C&#8722;H and C&#8722;F bond activation provides a one&#8208;step entry into a wide array of indoline scaffolds (43 examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield). This privileged substructure is common in natural products and pharmaceuticals alike, and cannot be accessed by traditional condensation reactions.

         <title>Rational Design of Coumarin&#8208;Based Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Blue Emitters for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarins were employed as new acceptors to construct HLCT emitters, namely pPh&#8208;7M, pPh&#8208;7P, and pPh&#8208;6M. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by the connection site and substituent of coumarins. The solution&#8208;processed OLED devices based on pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components realized the champion EQEmax of 6.54&#8201;%, and deep&#8208;blue emission wavelength at 446&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the &#8220;hot excitons&#8221; channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7P), 7&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7M), and 6&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7&#8208;position and the substituent at C3&#8208;position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh&#8208;7P, pPh&#8208;7M, and pPh&#8208;6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution&#8208;processed doped OLEDs based on pPh&#8208;6M exhibited deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446&#8197;nm, maximum luminance of 8755&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, maximum current efficiency of 5.83&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54&#8201;%. The results reveal that pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components has better OLED performance.

The solution-processed OLED devices based on pPh-6M with dominant &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;LE and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CT components realized the champion &lt;i&gt;EQE&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 6.54&#8201;%, and deep-blue emission wavelength at 446&#8197;nm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the &#8220;hot excitons&#8221; channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge-transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high-lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)-acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4-yl(9,9-dimethyl-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluoren-2-yl)amino)-3-phenyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-isochromen-1-one (pPh-7P), 7-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4-yl(9,9-dimethyl-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluoren-2-yl)amino)-3-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-isochromen-1-one (pPh-7M), and 6-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4-yl(9,9-dimethyl-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluoren-2-yl)amino)-3-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-isochromen-1-one (pPh-6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7-position and the substituent at C3-position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh-7P, pPh-7M, and pPh-6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution-processed doped OLEDs based on pPh-6M exhibited deep-blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446&#8197;nm, maximum luminance of 8755&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, maximum current efficiency of 5.83&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54&#8201;%. The results reveal that pPh-6M with dominant &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;LE and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CT components has better OLED performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric 1,4&#8208;Addition of Diarylphosphine Oxides to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;Unsaturated 2&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition of diarylphosphine oxides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles catalyzed by oxazaborolidine (CBS) was disclosed in this work. Interestingly, this methodology features a wide range of substrates scope, simple catalytic system and mild reaction conditions (room temperature and air insensitive).







Abstract
Here we introduce a metal&#8208;free, catalytic and enantioselective strategy from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles to the chiral phosphorous 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Interestingly, this methodology was catalyzed by the classical and commercial oxazaborolidine under mild conditions. This strategy features a wide range of substrates scope with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The possible mechanism further suggests the key of this reaction through the cleavage of diarylphosphine oxides using Frustrated Lewis Pairs theory.

         <title>Indium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green chemistry is gaining increasing relevance in the development of chemical reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401070), G. Haberhauer and co&#8208;workers report the haloalkynylation reaction of various acetylenes with indium(III) bromide as a catalyst. A significant advantage of this reaction is its ability to convert both iodoacetylenes and alkyl&#8208;substituted haloacetylenes, marking progress in the development of sustainable catalysts with industrial applications.

This Cover Feature illustrates the indole C5&#8208;selective bromination and subsequent derivatization of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids. The background depicts temari balls, a form of Japanese folk art and craft. Temari balls are meticulously created by stitching together silk threads with precision. We liken this precision and the connectivity between the temari balls to our discovered site&#8208;selective reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Ishikawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401153).

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic C(sp2)&#8210;H Activation of Formate&#160;for Hydrocarboxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven carboxylation offers a promising approach for synthesizing valuable fine chemicals under mild conditions. Here we disclose a heterogeneous photocatalytic strategy of C(sp2)&#8210;H activation of formate for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes over zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4) under visible light. This protocol functions well with a variety of substituted styrenes with good to excellent yields; it also works for unactivated alkenes albeit with lower yields. Mechanistic studies confirm the existence of CO2&#8226;&#8722; as a key intermediate. It was found that C(sp2)&#8210;H activation of formate is induced by S&#8226; species on the surface of ZnIn2S4 via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) instead of a photogenerated hole oxidation mechanism. Moreover, both cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8210;H of HCOO&#8722; and formation of a benzylic anion were found to be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step for the hydrocarboxylation of styrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Hydrophobic Amino Acid Scanning to Develop Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel antivirals is crucial not only for managing current COVID&#8208;19 infections but for addressing potential future zoonotic outbreaks. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) is vital for viral replication and viability and therefore serves as an attractive target for antiviral intervention. Herein, we report the optimization of a cyclic peptide inhibitor that emerged from an mRNA display selection against the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro to enhance its cell permeability and in vitro antiviral activity. By identifying mutation&#8208;tolerant amino acid residues within the peptide sequence, we describe the development of a second&#8208;generation Mpro inhibitor bearing five cyclohexylalanine residues. This cyclic peptide analogue exhibited significantly improved cell permeability and antiviral activity compared to the parent peptide. This approach highlights the importance of optimizing cyclic peptide hits for activity against intracellular targets such as the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizing Cerium Oxide Particle Synthesis with Hybrid Polyion Complex Templates for Enhanced Oxidation Performance in Photo&#8208;Fenton Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid poly&#8208;ion complexes were synthesized through the complexation of a double hydrophilic copolymer with Ce(III) ions. These colloids act as reservoirs for cerium ions, enabling the synthesis of cerium&#8208;based Prussian blue nanoparticles with a cubic structure, a narrow size distribution around 100 nm, and good colloidal stability in water. Upon high&#8208;temperature calcination, these nanoparticles are transformed into a cerium/iron&#8208;based metal oxide catalyst (CeO2/Fe2O3). The resultant composite catalyst demonstrates superior performance in the photo&#8208;Fenton oxidation of methylene blue pollutants, achieving a conversion efficiency that rivals other metal&#8208;based oxides and cerium&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

The resultant composite catalyst demonstrates superior performance in the photo-Fenton oxidation of methylene blue pollutants, achieving a conversion efficiency that rivals other metal-based oxides and cerium-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macromolecular Nano&#8208;Assemblies for Enhancing the Effect of Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Photodynamic Therapy Against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT), photosensitizers absorb light energy, which is then transferred to ambient O2, and subsequently cytotoxic singlet oxygen (1O2) is generated. Therefore, the availability of O2 and the utilization efficiency of generated 1O2 are two significant factors that influence the effectiveness of PDT. However, tumor microenvironments (TMEs) characterized by hypoxia and limited utilization efficiency of 1O2 resulting from its short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance significantly restrict the applicability of PDT for hypoxic tumors. To address these challenges, numerous macromolecular nano&#8208;assemblies (MNAs) have been designed to relieve hypoxia, utilize hypoxia or enhance the utilization efficiency of 1O2. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on recent advancements achieved with MNAs in enhancing the effectiveness of O2&#8208;dependent PDT against hypoxic tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox properties of Mn(III)porphyrins in hyaluronan oxidative degradation: Single electron transfer mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic Mn(III)&#8208;meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin derivatives, substituted in para position with different size alkyl chains, were investigated to function as antioxidants in free&#8208;radical degradation of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass hyaluronan by the methods of rotational viscometry and oximetry. The results of rotational viscometry showed that MnTM&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ showed high efficiency in decomposing H2O2, and reducing of peroxidized hyaluronan. When using oxygen electrode, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ applied to function as protective antioxidants in hyaluronan degradation, the uptake of dissolved oxygen from the reaction milieu was rapid, followed by continual increase in oxygen concentration up to the end of the measurement. However, when especially MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ were examined as hyaluronan chain&#8208;breaking antioxidants, after short&#8208;term dissolved oxygen uptake, almost no increase in oxygen concentration was shown.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8216;Passivated Precursor&#8217; Approach to All&#8208;Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters and Total Structure Determination of Au130</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach is developed for the efficient synthesis and isolation of all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters. Direct reduction of dpa&#8208;passivated precursor Au&#8208;dpa (Hdpa = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridylamine) in one&#8208;pot under ambient conditions gives a series of clusters including Au22(C&#8801;CR)18 (R = &#8208;C6H4&#8208;2&#8208;F), Au36(C&#8801;CR)24, Au44(C&#8801;CR)28, Au130(C&#8801;CR)50, and Au144(C&#8801;CR)60. These clusters can be well separated via column chromatography. The overall isolation yield of this series of clusters is 40% (based on gold), which is much improved in comparison with previous approaches. It is notable that the molecular structure of the giant cluster Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 is revealed, which presents important information for understanding the structure of the mysterious Au130 nanoclusters. Theoretical calculations indicated Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 has a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap than Au130(S&#8208;C6H4&#8208;4&#8208;CH3)50. This facile and reliable synthetic approach will greatly accelerate further studies on all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters.</dc:description>

The macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties of [H2Ebpe](NO3)2 crystals were quantified by a three&#8208;point bending test, which gave a stress&#8208;strain curve with an elastic modulus of 1.18 GPa, and its values are lower than those of other flexible elastic organic crystals. It can also be reversibly bent through the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the olefin moiety, depending on the direction of UV irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Intermolecular Interactions in Organic Emitters for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adverse aggregated&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem of most electroluminescent materials existing in highly doped thin films is one of the key factors impeding the commercialization of&#160;high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) panel. Whereas, by delicately constructing and modulating moderate intermolecular interactions, some aggregates have been demonstrated to present distinct luminescent properties such as tunable emission spectra, improved photoluminescence quantum yields, different emission mechanism and enhanced horizontal transition dipole ratio (&#920;) of emitting layer, providing feasible solution for ACQ problem. The luminescence from newly generated emissive state in aggregates is different from the traditional &#8220;isolated&#8221; molecules in organic electronics and will possess novel properties and applications. Herein, we summarize the different types of intermolecular interactions within emitter aggregates exhibiting distinct luminescent mechanisms, as well as their effects on photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties, offering reliable reference for the advancement&#160;of highly efficient OLEDs utilizing aggregated emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic Behavior of the &#8220;Nucleophilic&#8221; Pyramidane: Reactivity of Ge&#8208;Pyramidane towards Organolithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The particular reactivity of the recently discovered class of the main group element polyhedral clusters, pyramidanes, remains largely unexplored. In this communication, we report the reaction of the germapyramidane with tert&#8208;butyllithium leading to the rather unusual organogermanium compound [Li+(thf)2]&#183;2&#8211;, as the product of the formal insertion of a Ge&#8208;apex into the C&#8211;Li bond. This reactivity mode exemplifies unusual electrophilic behaviour of a pyramidane, which is a priori considered as a nucleophilic reagent. Being highly reactive, [Li+(thf)2]&#183;2&#8211; readily undergoes reactions with electrophiles (MeI, EtBr), initially forming intermediate germahousenes, which isomerize to the thermodynamically more favourable germoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;stabilized Gallium Sulfides and Selenides Supported by a Bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide Ligand: Trapping Singly Base&#8208;Stabilized Gallium Chalcogenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallylene supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide (Boxm) ligand was synthesized and structurally characterized. The reaction of this gallylene with triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide yielded dimeric gallium sulfide and selenide. These compounds could be converted to monomeric terminal sulfide and selenide by coordination of an external Lewis base such as an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC or IMe4) and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridiene (DMAP). These doubly&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide reacted with phenyl isocyanate to give the corresponding cycloadducts by releasing the Lewis base, indicating the formation of a single&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin Atropisomerism as a Molecular Engineering Tool in Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Recognition, Supramolecular Assembly, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin atropisomerism, which arises from restricted &#963;&#8208;bond rotation between the macrocycle and a sufficiently bulky substituent, was identified in 1969 by Gottwald and Ullman in 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)porphyrins. Henceforth, an entirely new field has emerged utilizing this transformative tool. This review strives to explain the consequences of atropisomerism in porphyrins, the methods which have been developed for their separation and analysis and present the diverse array of applications. Porphyrins alone possess intriguing properties and a structure which can be easily decorated and molded for a specific function. Therefore, atropisomerism serves as a transformative tool, making it possible to obtain even a specific molecular shape. Atropisomerism has been thoroughly exploited in catalysis and molecular recognition yet presents both challenges and opportunities in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiaromaticity of Cycloheptatrienyl Anions: Structure, Acidity, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigations of the nature and degree of antiaromaticity of cycloheptatrienyl anion derivatives using both experimental and computational tools are presented. The ground state of cycloheptatrienyl anion in the gas phase is triplet, planar and Baird&#8208;aromatic. In DMSO, it assumes a singlet distorted allylic form with a paratropic ring current. The other derivatives in both phases assume either allylic or diallylic conformations depending on the substituent pattern. A combination of experimental and computational methods was used to determine the pKa values of 16 derivatives in DMSO, which ranged from 36 to &#8211;10.7. We revealed that the stronger stabilization of the anionic system, which correlates with acidity, does not necessarily imply a lower degree of anti&#8208;aromaticity in terms of magnetic properties. Conversely, the substitution pattern first affects the geometry of the ring through the bulkiness of the substituents and their better conjugation with a more distorted system. Consequently, the distortion reduces the cyclic conjugation in the &#960;&#8208;system and thereby decreases the paratropic current in a magnetic field, which manifests itself as a decrease in the NICS. The triplet&#8208;state geometries and magnetic properties are nearly independent on the substitution pattern, which is typical for simple aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Current Developments in Emerging Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Persistent Luminescent Scintillators and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PersLSs) are promising luminescent materials for many emerging applications. This review summarizes the latest development of PersLSs, including their persistent luminescence mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of optical properties, and their applications in the field of information security, bioimaging, as well as sensing.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators have the ability to convert the absorbed X&#8208;ray irradiation into ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators with excellent persistent luminescence (PersL) are emerging as a new class of PersL materials recently. They have attracted great attention due to their unique &#8220;self&#8208;luminescence&#8221; characteristic and potential applications. In this review, we comb through and focus on current developments of lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PersLSs), including their PersL mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of PersL properties (e.&#8201;g. emission wavelength, intensity, and duration time), as well as their promising applications (e.&#8201;g. information storage, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, bio&#8208;imaging, and photodynamic therapy). We hope this review will provide valuable guidance for the future development of PersLSs.

         <title>Understanding the Remarkable Stability of Well&#8208;Defined Dinuclear Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stuck two&#8208;gether: The tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand stabilizes a dicopper carbene complex by enforcing its dinuclear core. This dinuclear copper core stabilizes a Fischer carbene through &#960;&#8208;backdonation to such an extent that it is unreactive even towards oxygen. However, we show that carbene transfer from this dinuclear complex towards PPh3 is still possible.







Abstract
The synthesis of a well&#8208;defined dicopper carbene complex supported by the PNNP (2,7&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine) expanded pincer ligand is reported. This carbene complex is remarkably stable, even in the presence of air and water. The reactivity of this complex was explored towards typical carbene transfer substrates and its electronic structure was investigated. Using a combination of experiments and DFT calculations, the principles that underly the stability of dinuclear carbene complexes are probed.

However, we show that carbene transfer from this dinuclear complex towards PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is still possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a well-defined dicopper carbene complex supported by the PNNP (2,7-bis(di-tert-butylphosphaneyl)methyl-1,8-naphthyridine) expanded pincer ligand is reported. This carbene complex is remarkably stable, even in the presence of air and water. The reactivity of this complex was explored towards typical carbene transfer substrates and its electronic structure was investigated. Using a combination of experiments and DFT calculations, the principles that underly the stability of dinuclear carbene complexes are probed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple Bonding in AeN&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative bond in the 10 valence&#8208;electron species AeN&#8722; has a multireference character with high bond multiplicity in the triplet (3&#928;) ground state of CaN&#8722; and SrN&#8722; and singlet (1&#931;+) ground state of BaN&#8722;.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels as well as using density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeN&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba). The anions CaN&#8722; and SrN&#8722; have electronic triplet (3&#928;) ground states with nearly identical bond dissociation energies De ~57&#8197;kcal/mol calculated at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD level. In contrast, the heavier homologue BaN&#8722; has a singlet (1&#931;+) ground state, which is only 1.1&#8197;kcal/mol below the triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state. The computed bond dissociation energy of (1&#931;+) BaN&#8722; is 68.4&#8197;kcal/mol. The calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;full/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and BP86&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels are in reasonable agreement with the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD data, except for the singlet (1&#931;+) state, which has a large multireference character. The calculated atomic partial charges given by the CM5, Voronoi and Hirshfeld methods suggest small to medium&#8208;sized Ae&#8592;N&#8722; charge donation for most electronic states. In contrast, the NBO method predicts for all species medium to large Ae&#8594;N&#8722; electronic charge donation, which is due to the neglect of the (n)p AOs of Ae atoms as genuine valence orbitals. Neither the bond orders nor the bond lengths correlate with the bond dissociation energies. The EDA&#8722;NOCV calculations show that the heavier alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their (n)s and (n&#8208;1)d orbitals for covalent bonding.

         <title>Comparison of Classical and Green RPLC Methods in the Determination of pKa Values of Some Piperazine Group Antihistamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the environmentally friendly green RPLC method was used as an alternative to classical RPLC methods in the determination of the pKa values of some antihistamines of the piperazine group and compared with the data obtained with other methods. In addition, the greenness of the RPLC methods used was determined using green metric tools.







Abstract
In this study, protonation constant values and liquid chromatographic behaviors of hydrophobic cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, hydroxyzine, cinnarizine, cetirizine, meclizine, and buclizine in some water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures were examined for the first time using classical and green reverse phase liquid chromatography methods. In the isocratic study, the relationship of the retention time and mobile phase pH in water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures containing acetonitrile (45, 50, 55, 60, 65%, v/v), methanol (60, 65, 70, 75%, v/v) and ethanol (45, 50, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 65%, v/v) were determined at 37&#8201;&#176;C. In the study, XBridge C18 and Gemini NX C18 columns suitable for the chemical properties of basic compounds were used. The obtained liquid chromatographic data were analyzed using the linear solvation energy relationship methodology and the SOLVER program. The aqueous protonation constant values of the investigated compounds were calculated using the linear relationship between the protonation constant data calculated in studied binary mixtures and some macroscopic constant values of the solvents used. The greenness of methods developed using three different solvents was evaluated with the Analytical Greenness Metric Approach, the Green Analytical Procedures Index, and the Green Solvent Selection Tool approaches.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling Exhibiting Unexpectedly Small Primary Kinetic Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model reaction occurring exclusively via H&#8208;atom QMT at cryogenic temperatures shows unexpectedly small primary H/D KIEs. Evidence suggests that these surprising results arise due to the coupling of the migrating H/D tunneling particle with the N2 matrix medium. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.







Abstract
Probing quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in chemical reactions is crucial to understanding and developing new transformations. Primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) beyond the semiclassical maximum values of 7&#8211;10 (room temperature) are commonly used to assess substantial QMT contributions in one&#8208;step hydrogen transfer reactions, because of the much greater QMT probability of protium vs. deuterium. Nevertheless, we report here the discovery of a reaction model occurring exclusively by H&#8208;atom QMT with residual primary H/D KIEs. 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenylnitrene, generated in N2 matrix, was found to isomerize to an imino&#8208;ketone via sequential (domino) QMT involving anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization (rate determining step) and [1,4]&#8208;H shift reactions. These sequential QMT transformations were also observed in the OD&#8208;deuterated sample, and unexpected primary H/D KIEs between 3 and 4 were measured at 3 to 20&#8197;K. Analogous residual primary H/D KIEs were found in the anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization QMT of 2&#8208;cyanophenol in a N2 matrix. Evidence strongly indicates that these intriguing isotope&#8208;insensitive QMT reactivities arise due to the solvation effects of the N2 matrix medium, putatively through coupling with the moving H/D tunneling particle. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Calix[4]arene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages and Their Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two octahedral porous organic cages with a significantly high specific surface area have been synthesized and their potential application in gas adsorption investigated by evaluating their capacity to adsorb SO2, CO2, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6. They also proved successful in efficiently adsorbing static iodine (I2) vapor.







Abstract
Two crystalline large&#8208;sized porous organic cages (POCs) based on conical calix[4]arene (C4A) were designed and synthesized. The four&#8208;jaw C4A unit tends to follow the face&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly law with the planar triangular building blocks such as tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) to generate a predictable cage with a stoichiometry of [6+8]. The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI&#8208;TOF/TOF spectra. The protonated molecular ion peaks of C4A&#8208;TAPA and C4A&#8208;TAPB were observed at m/z 5109.0 (calculated for C336H240O24N32: m/z 5109.7) and m/z 5594.2 (calculated for C384H264O24N24: m/z 5598.4). C4A&#8208;POCs exhibit I&#8208;type N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption isotherms with the BET surface areas of 1444.9&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1014.6&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. The CO2 uptakes at 273&#8197;K are 62.1&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 52.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a pressure of 100 KPa. The saturated iodine vapor static uptakes at 348&#8197;K are 3.9&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 3.5&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. The adsorption capacity of C4A&#8208;TAPA for SO2 reaches to 124.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;bar. Additionally, the adsorption capacities of C4A&#8208;TAPA for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were evaluated.

&lt;p&gt;Two crystalline large-sized porous organic cages (POCs) based on conical calix[4]arene (C4A) were designed and synthesized. The four-jaw C4A unit tends to follow the face-directed self-assembly law with the planar triangular building blocks such as tris(4-aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) to generate a predictable cage with a stoichiometry of [6+8]. The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra. The protonated molecular ion peaks of C4A-TAPA and C4A-TAPB were observed at m/z 5109.0 (calculated for C&lt;sub&gt;336&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;240&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;: m/z 5109.7) and m/z 5594.2 (calculated for C&lt;sub&gt;384&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;264&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;: m/z 5598.4). C4A-POCs exhibit I-type N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption-desorption isotherms with the BET surface areas of 1444.9&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1014.6&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes at 273&#8197;K are 62.1&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 52.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a pressure of 100 KPa. The saturated iodine vapor static uptakes at 348&#8197;K are 3.9&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 3.5&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The adsorption capacity of C4A-TAPA for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reaches to 124.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;bar. Additionally, the adsorption capacities of C4A-TAPA for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Upconversion in Mononuclear Lanthanide Co&#8208;Crystal Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion from Pr3+ at room temperature. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.







Abstract
In this work, we developed two kinds of co&#8208;crystal assemblies systems, consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb3+ and Er3+ and mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+, which can achieve Er3+ and Pr3+ upconversion luminescence, respectively, by Yb3+ sensitization under 980&#8197;nm excitation. The structure and composition of two co&#8208;crystal assemblies were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. By investigation of the series of two assemblies, respectively, it is found that the strongest upconversion luminescence is both obtained when the molar ratio of Yb3+ and Ln3+ (Ln=Er or Pr) is 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. The energy transfer mechanism of Er3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion, while that of Pr3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion and cooperative sensitization upconversion. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension at room temperature, which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Aromaticity in Semi&#8208;Condensed Figure&#8208;Eight Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromaticity in the illustrated semi&#8208;condensed figure&#8208;eight molecule, a [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,4)cyclophane, is dominated by a (semi&#8208;)local character with some additional minor global character, as allowed by the small torsion angle along the single bonds.







Abstract
Electron delocalization and aromaticity was comparatively evaluated in recently synthesized figure&#8208;eight molecules made of two condensed U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moieties connected either by two single bonds or by two para&#8208;phenylene groups. The selected examples include molecules that incorporate eight&#8208;membered and sixteen&#8208;membered rings, as well as a doubly [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,4)cyclophane. We probe whether some electron delocalization could occur through the stereogenic single bonds in these molecules: Is aromaticity purely (semi&#8208;)local, or possibly also global in these molecules? It was concluded that the situation can go from a purely (semi&#8208;)local character when the dihedral angle at the connecting single bonds is large, such as in biphenyl, to a predominantly (semi&#8208;)local character with a minor global contribution when the dihedral angle is small, such as in the para&#8208;phenylene connectors of the [5] helicene&#8208;bridged cyclophane.

         <title>A Systematic Study of Nonionic Di&#8208; and Multiborane Catalysts for the Oligomerization and Polymerization of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borane catalysis has emerged as a powerful technology in epoxide polymerization. Still, the structure&#8208;activity correlations for these catalysts are not fully understood to date, especially regarding compounds with nonionic backbones. Thus, in this work, 13 different borane catalysts of this respective type are described and investigated for their epoxide oligomerization and polymerization performance, using propylene oxide (PO), 1&#8208;butylene oxide (BO) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) as monomers. Structurally, special emphasis is put on catalysts with different linker lengths and linker flexibilities as well as the introduction of more than two borane functionalities. Importantly, this screening is conducted both under typical polymerization conditions as well as under the chain transfer agent (CTA)&#8208;rich conditions relevant for large&#8208;scale production. It is found that suitable preorganization of the borane groups, such as present in biphenyl derivatives, offers a simple route to high&#8208;performing catalysts and quantitative monomer conversion of the investigated epoxides. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a diborane&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization can be kept active over weeks, whereby repeated addition of monomer batches (14 steps) constantly results in full conversion and well&#8208;defined oligoethers, underlining the practical potential of this method. The absence of co&#8208;initiating counter ions is suggested as an inherent advantage of nonionic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface stress response of a crystal influences its performance characteristics. We develop, test and apply a new atomistic model for computing the surface elastic properties of molecular crystals. The model was used to support the experimental discovery of a stiff molecular crystal of L&#8211;aspartic acid whose morphology, facet and nanomechanical properties were all correctly predicted prior to experiments.







Abstract
Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of crystalline materials that can respond to mechanical stress by dissipating internal strain in a number of ways. Given the serendipitous nature of the discovery of such crystals, progress in the field requires advances in computational methods for the accurate and high&#8211;throughput computation of the nanomechanical properties of crystals on specific facets which are exposed to mechanical stress. Here, we develop and apply a new atomistic model for computing the surface elastic moduli of crystals on any set of facets of interest using dispersion&#8211;corrected density functional theory (DFT&#8722;D) methods. The model was benchmarked against a total of 24 reported nanoindentation measurements from a diverse set of molecular crystals and was found to be generally reliable. Using only the experimental crystal structure of the dietary supplement, L&#8211;aspartic acid, the model was subsequently applied under blind test conditions, to correctly predict the growth morphology, facet and nanomechanical properties of L&#8211;aspartic acid to within the accuracy of the measured elastic stiffness of the crystal, 24.53&#177;0.56&#8197;GPa. This work paves the way for the computational design and experimental realization of other functional molecular crystals with tailor&#8211;made mechanical properties.

         <title>m6A methylation of transcription leader sequence impacts discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome has been shown to be m6A methylated at several positions in vivo. Strikingly, a DRACH motif, the recognition motif for adenosine methylation, resides in the core of the transcriptional regulatory leader sequence (TRS&#8208;L) at position A74, which is highly conserved and essential for viral discontinuous transcription. Methylation at position A74 correlates with viral pathogenicity. Discontinuous transcription produces a set of subgenomic mRNAs that function as templates for translation of all structural and accessory proteins. A74 is base&#8208;paired in the short stem&#8208;loop structure 5&#8217;SL3 that opens during discontinuous transcription to form long&#8208;range RNA&#8208;RNA interactions with nascent (&#8208;)&#8208;strand transcripts at complementary TRS&#8208;body sequences. A74 can be methylated by human METTL3/METTL14 complex in vitro. Here, we investigate its impact on the structural stability of 5&#8217;SL3 and the long&#8208;range TRS&#8208;leader:TRS&#8208;body duplex formation necessary for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs of all four viral structural proteins. Methylation uniformly destabilizes 5'SL3 and long&#8208;range duplexes and alters their relative populations in equilibrium, suggesting that m6A74 modification acts as a regulator for the abundance of viral structural proteins due to this destabilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation Reactions: Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Activation of N&#8208;Halosuccinimides and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of triaryltelluronium salts to interact with N&#8208;halosuccinimides (NXS) through chalcogen bonding (ChB) in the solid state and in solution is demonstrated herein. Cocrystals of the triaryltelluronium bearing two CF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups per aryl ring with N&#8208;chloro&#8208;, N&#8208;bromo&#8208; and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (respectively NCS, NBS and NIS) were analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, evidencing a ChB between tellurium and the carbonyl group of NXS. This ChB was confirmed in solution by NMR spectroscopy, especially by 125Te NMR titration experiment, which allowed the determination of the association constant (Ka) between the telluronium and NBS. The so&#8208;obtained Ka value of 17.3 &#177; 0.6 M&#8208;1 indicated a moderate interaction in solution because of the competitive role of the solvent. The strength of the Te&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O ChB was however sufficient enough to promote the catalytic halofunctionalization of aromatics and of alkenes such as the intra&#8208; and intermolecular haloalkoxylation and haloesterification of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust, Reproducible, and Scalable Synthesis of Silver Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains a challenge to accomplish colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals marked by high quality, large quantity, and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency. Here we report a self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18&#8722;60 nm. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents. The new setup also allows us to easily optimize the amount of O2 (from air) trapped in the system, ensuring burst nucleation of single&#8208;crystal seeds, followed by their slow growth into nanocubes. Most significantly, the new setup allows for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches. The availability of high&#8208;quality Ag nanocubes in such a large quantity is anticipated to substantially boost their use in applications related to plasmonics, catalysis, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Systems and Methods for Continuous Evolution of Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution generates novel biomolecules with desired functions by iteratively diversifying the genetic sequence of wildtype biomolecules, relaying the genetic information to the molecule with function, and selecting the variants that progresses towards the properties of interest. While traditional directed evolution consumes significant labor and time for each step, continuous evolution seeks to automate all steps so directed evolution can proceed with minimum human intervention and dramatically shortened time. A major application of continuous evolution is the generation of novel enzymes, which catalyze reactions under conditions that are not favorable to their wildtype counterparts, or on altered substrates. The challenge to continuously evolve enzymes lies in automating sufficient, unbiased gene diversification, providing selection for a wide array of reaction types, and linking the genetic information to the phenotypic function. Over years of development, continuous evolution has accumulated versatile strategies to address these challenges, enabling its use as a general tool for enzyme engineering. As the capability of continuous evolution continues to expand, its impact will increase across various industries. In this review, we summarize the working mechanisms of recently developed continuous evolution strategies, discuss examples of their applications focusing on enzyme evolution, and point out their limitations and future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Stacking Approach Enabling Interconversion between Bis(xanthylium) and its Reduced Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophane&#8208;type dications with two units of xanthylium were designed, with the expectation that intramolecular interaction between cation units could induce changes in absorption and redox behavior. The desired dications were synthesized via the macrocyclic diketone as a key intermediate, which was efficiently obtained by a stepwise etherification. X&#8208;ray and UV/Vis measurements revealed that the cyclophane&#8208;type dications adopt a stacking structure in both the crystal and solution. Due to the intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of the xanthylium units, a considerable blue shift compared to the corresponding monocations and a two&#8208;stage one&#8208;electron reduction process were observed in the dications. Furthermore, upon electrochemical reduction of dications, the formation of biradicals via radical cation species was demonstrated by UV/Vis spectroscopy with several isosbestic points at both stages. Therefore, the cation&#8208;stacking approach is a promising way to provide novel properties due to perturbation of their molecular orbitals and to stabilize the reduced species even though they have open&#8208;shell characters.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Diastereoselectivity in Dearomatizing Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Nitroarenes with 2&#8208;Trimethylsilyloxycyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions between simple nitroarenes and cyclic silyloxydienes are carried out under high pressure at room temperature in the absence of any chemical promoter to generate 3D&#8208;scaffolds with exquisite exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity, the exo approach being characterized by a lower distortion of the substrates and by more favorable orbital interactions presumably between the nitro group and the dienic part.







Abstract
Dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions between nitroarenes and 2&#8208;trimethylsilyloxycyclohexadiene are carried out under high pressure at room temperature in the absence of any chemical promoter. Reactions are performed with different arenes, including the highly aromatic naphthalenes and quinolines. They lead to 3D&#8208;scaffolds with exquisite exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The exo approach is characterized by lower distortion of the substrates in a late TS and by more favorable orbital interactions presumably between the nitro group and the dienic part, explaining the stereoselectivity.

The &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; approach is characterized by lower distortion of the substrates in a late TS and by more favorable orbital interactions presumably between the nitro group and the dienic part, explaining the stereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Chirality in Inorganic Crystals: from Construction to Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring chirality in inorganic crystals is a fascinating endeavor, encompassing both structural and electronic chirality. This work offers a comprehensive review of the classification and construction of chirality in inorganic crystals. Additionally, it delves into the potential applications of these crystals within the realms of chemistry and physics, providing a thorough insight into their multifaceted implications and uses.







Abstract
Chirality represents a fundamental characteristic inherent in nature, playing a pivotal role in the emergence of homochirality and the origin of life. While the principles of chirality in organic chemistry are well&#8208;documented, the exploration of chirality within inorganic crystal structures continues to evolve. This ongoing development is primarily due to the diverse nature of crystal/amorphous structures in inorganic materials, along with the intricate symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships in the geometry of their constituent atoms. In this review, we commence with a summary of the foundational concept of chirality in molecules and solid states matters. This is followed by an introduction of structural chirality and electronic chirality in three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials. The construction of chirality in inorganic materials is classified into physical photolithography, wet&#8208;chemistry method, self&#8208;assembly, and chiral imprinting. Highlighting the significance of this field, we also summarize the research progress of chiral inorganic materials for applications in optical activity, enantiomeric recognition and chiral sensing, selective adsorption and enantioselective separation, asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, and chirality&#8208;induced spin polarization. This review aims to provide a reference for ongoing research in chiral inorganic materials and potentially stimulate innovative strategies and novel applications in the realm of chirality.

         <title>Improving Fatigue Resistance and Autonomous Switching of pH Responsive Hydrazones by Pulses of a Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel approach for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones using trichloroacetic acid pulses. The use of this transient acid enables reversible switching of hydrazones without apparent fatigue even after 50 cycles. Kinetic analysis indicates a significant dependence of switching operations on the electronic properties of substituents.







Abstract
The chemically triggered reversible switching of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones involves rotary motion&#8208;induced configurational changes, serving as a prototype for constructing an array of molecular machines. Typically, the configurational isomerization of such switches into two distinct forms (E/Z) occurs through the alteration of the pH the medium, achieved by successive additions of acid and base stimuli. However, this process results in intermittent operation due to the concomitant accumulation of salt after each cycle, limiting switching performance to only a few cycles (5&#8211;6). In this context, we introduce a novel strategy for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of hydrazones in acetonitrile using pulses of trichloroacetic acid as a chemical fuel. The use of this transient acid enabled reversible switching of hydrazones even after 50&#8197;cycles without causing significant fatigue. To test the broad viability of the fuel, a series of ortho/para&#8208;substituted hydrazones were synthesized and their switching performance was investigated. The analysis of kinetic data showed a strong dependency of switching operations including the lifetime of transient state, on the electronic properties of substituents. Finally, a distinct color change from yellow to orange due to reversible switching of the para&#8208;methoxy substituted hydrazone was employed for the creation of rewritable messages on commercially available paper.

         <title>In Silico Design and Characterization of a New Molecular Electride: Li@Calix[3]Pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present Li@calix[3]pyrrole, the newest member of the molecular electride family. Electron density, electron localization function, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses confirm the presence of a localized electride electron in the void adjacent to the pyrrole N&#8722;H groups. The origin of the electride character and the bonding environment are elucidated by electron decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Electrides, in which anionic electrons are localized independently of the atoms in the compound, have shown promise, especially as catalysts and optoelectronic materials. Here, we present a new computationally designed molecular electride, Li@calix[3]pyrrole (Li@C3P). Electron density and electron localization function analyses unequivocally confirm the existence of localized electride electron density, outside the system, independent of any specific atoms. Non&#8208;covalent interaction plots further validate the character of the isolated localized electron, suggesting that the system can be accurately represented by Li+@calix[3]pyrrole&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;e&#8722;, denoting its distinct charge separation.

Furthermore, energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence theory sheds light on the mechanism of electron density transfer from Li to the C3P cage, yielding the charge&#8208;separated Li@C3P complex. In addition to the electron transfer, a key factor to its electride nature is the electronic structure of the CnP cage, which has its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital located in the void adjacent to the N&#8722;H groups at the back of the bowl&#8208;shaped CnP cage.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Isochromanes by Oxidative Aminocatalysis and Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes is reported by combining enantioselective oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis. The presented isochromanes can be applied to scaffold derivatization and photoaffinity labelling of proteins.







Abstract
A novel strategy that combines oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis allows the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes, a motif that is prevalent in natural products and synthetic bioactive compounds. In the first step, &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes and propargylic alcohols are transformed into &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with excellent optical purities (&gt;90&#8201;% ee) via oxidative umpolung with DDQ and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. Subsequent gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation affords the isochromane products with retention of the quaternary stereocenter. A second approach explores the use of allylic alcohols as reaction partners for the oxidative coupling to furnish &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with generally lower enantiopurities. Stereoretentive cyclization to isochromane products is achieved via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation with allylic acetates as a reactive handle. A number of synthetic elaborations and a biological study on these &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes highlight the potential applicability of the presented method.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Disaccharide Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are vital polysaccharides with complex structures. Disaccharide analysis, involving enzymatic depolymerization and liquid chromatography, is commonly used for their analysis. Here, direct infusion nESI ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) is used to reduce measurement time from hours to minutes. Chemical modification and stable isotope&#8208;labelled standards enable quantification.







Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear and acidic polysaccharides. They are ubiquitous molecules, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Despite being structurally simple at first glance, with a repeating backbone of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine dimers, GAGs display a highly complex structure, which predominantly results from their heterogeneous sulfation patterns. The commonly applied method for compositional analysis of all GAGs is &#8220;disaccharide analysis.&#8221; In this process, GAGs are enzymatically depolymerized into disaccharides, derivatized with a fluorescent label, and then analysed through liquid chromatography. The limiting factor in the high throughput analysis of GAG disaccharides is the time&#8208;consuming liquid chromatography.

     alt="Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry-Based Disaccharide Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are vital polysaccharides with complex structures. Disaccharide analysis, involving enzymatic depolymerization and liquid chromatography, is commonly used for their analysis. Here, direct infusion nESI ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is used to reduce measurement time from hours to minutes. Chemical modification and stable isotope-labelled standards enable quantification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear and acidic polysaccharides. They are ubiquitous molecules, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Despite being structurally simple at first glance, with a repeating backbone of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine dimers, GAGs display a highly complex structure, which predominantly results from their heterogeneous sulfation patterns. The commonly applied method for compositional analysis of all GAGs is &#8220;disaccharide analysis.&#8221; In this process, GAGs are enzymatically depolymerized into disaccharides, derivatized with a fluorescent label, and then analysed through liquid chromatography. The limiting factor in the high throughput analysis of GAG disaccharides is the time-consuming liquid chromatography. To address this limitation, we here utilized trapped ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TIM-MS) for the separation of isomeric GAG disaccharides, which reduces the measurement time from hours to a few minutes. A full set of disaccharides comprises twelve structures, with eight possessing isomers. Most disaccharides cannot be differentiated by TIM-MS in underivatized form. Therefore, we developed chemical modifications to reduce sample complexity and enhance differentiability. Quantification is performed using stable isotope labelled standards, which are easily available due to the nature of the performed modifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of S&#8208;protected cysteine and the corresponding cysteine sulfoxide with increasing acidity of the reaction allowed one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide formation for insulin synthesis. The stepwise disulfide bonding system employed is unprecedented. In addition, the sulfoxide&#8208;mediated protocol enabled one&#8208;pot synthesis of a lipidated insulin analogue.







Abstract
An advanced insulin synthesis is presented that utilizes one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide bond formation enabled by acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxides in the presence of chloride anion. S&#8208;chlorocysteine generated from cysteine sulfoxides reacts with an S&#8208;protected cysteine to afford S&#8208;sulfenylsulfonium cation, which then furnishes the disulfide or reversely returns to the starting materials depending on the S&#8208;protection employed and the reaction conditions. Use of S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys(Acm)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) selectively give the disulfide under weak acid conditions in the presence of MgCl2 even if S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine (Cys(MBzl)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) are also present. In contrast, the S&#8208;MBzl pair yields the disulfide under more acidic conditions in the presence of a chloride anion source. These reaction conditions allowed a one&#8208;pot insulin synthesis. Additionally, lipidated insulin was prepared by a one&#8208;pot disulfide&#8208;bonding/lipidation sequence.

         <title>Benzoselenadiazole&#8208;Functionalized H&#8208;Bonded Arylamide Foldamers: Solvent&#8208;Responsive Properties and Helix Self&#8208;Assembly Directed by Chalcogen Bonding in Solid State</title>

A novel kind of benzoselenadiazole&#8208;functionalized H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior. The crystal structures reveal that further assembly of monomers was induced by effective intermolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interaction. And with the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and intermolecular chalcogen bonds, supramolecular linear and double helices structures were constructed in solid state.







Abstract
In this study, a series of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers bearing benzoselenadiazole ends with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior evidenced by 1D 1H NMR and 2D NOESY spectra. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy experiments show that the absorption wavelength of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers are significantly red&#8208;shifted due to the presence of benzoselenadiazole group. In addition, the crystal structures reveal that effective intermolecular dual Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interactions between benzoselenadiazole groups induce further assembly of the monomers. Remarkably, supramolecular linear and double helices structures are constructed under the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and intermolecular chalcogen bonding. Additionally, 2D DOSY diffusion spectra and theoretical modelling based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed to explore the persistence of intermolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interactions beyond the crystalline state.

         <title>Mimicking Ozonolysis via Mechanochemistry: Internal Alkynes to 1,2&#8208;Diketones using H5IO6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic acid is the sole oxidizing agent, yielding 1,2&#8208;diketones mechanochemically from diverse alkynes, effectively emulating ozone&#8216;s reactivity. It is environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and shows tolerance of different groups.







Abstract
Utilizing periodic acid as an environmentally benign oxidizing agent, this study introduces a novel mechanochemical method that mimics ozonolysis to convert internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, showcasing effective emulation of ozone&#8216;s reactivity. Notably, this oxidation occurs at room temperature in aerobic conditions, eliminating the need for toxic transition metals, hazardous oxidants, or expensive solvents. Through control experiments validating the mechanism, substantial evidence supports a concerted reaction pathway. This progress marks a significant stride toward cleaner and more efficient chemical synthesis, mitigating the environmental impact of conventional processes. Assessing the green chemistry metrics in both solvent&#8208;free and previously reported solvent&#8208;based methods, our eco&#8208;friendly protocol demonstrates an E&#8208;factor of 7.40, a 51.7&#8201;% atom economy, a 45.5&#8201;% atom efficiency, 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency, and 11.9&#8201;% reaction mass efficiency when solvents are not used.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Porphyrin Cavitand Breathing&#8208;In to Constrict Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis&#8208;Ni(II)porphyrin cavitand has been shown to undergo an elastic, breathing mechanism to accommodate incoming fullerenes. The binding is seen to depend on both the electronic and steric factors imposed by the porphyrin faces; additionally, the pillars connecting the two porphyrins undergo facile twisting on binding fullerene, demonstrating a constriction behaviour.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;porphyrin cages have long been exploited to bind fullerenes selectively for various applications. The major consideration for an effective binding here had been the cavity size. Herein, we structurally demonstrate that a bis&#8208;Ni&#8722;porphyrin cavitand having even a smaller cavity can host a larger fullerene by a breathing and ruffling mechanism. It has also been shown that both the electronic and steric influence at the meso&#8208; positions of the porphyrin in fact dictate the binding character. The smaller cavity of 2NiD exhibits preferential binding for C70 over C60; however, surprisingly, the larger cavities in 2HD and 2NiTD display stronger affinities for C60 over the larger fullerene. We show here that the structural elasticity infused both by the metalloporphyrins and the connecting bridges play a major role in directing the binding. These conclusions have adequately been supported by structural and spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, the suitability of one of the conjugates for photoinduced charge&#8208;separation has been investigated using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. 2NiD&#8835;C60 has a charge separation timescale of ~0.8&#8197;ps, while charge recombination occurs at a longer timescale of ~920&#8197;ps.

         <title>Novel Types of Phyllobilins in a Fern &#8208; Molecular Reporters of the Evolution of Chlorophyll Breakdown in the Paleozoic Era</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilin&#8208;type chlorophyll&#8208;catabolites in de&#8208;greened leaves of the bracken fern and of some angiosperms are molecular reporters of a common basic pathway of Chl&#8208;breakdown in two widely different plant divisions. However, the Chl&#8208;catabolite structures were revealed to also differ in striking ways, shedding light on the evolution of specific Chl&#8208;breakdown strategies in early land plants that existed in the Paleozoic, as progenitors of the extant flora.







Abstract
Breakdown of chlorophyll (Chl), as studied in angiosperms, follows the pheophorbide a oxygenase/phyllobilin (PaO/PB) pathway, furnishing linear tetrapyrroles, named phyllobilins (PBs). In an investigation with fern leaves we have discovered iso&#8208;phyllobilanones (iPBs) with an intriguingly rearranged and oxidized carbon skeleton. We report here a key second group of iPBs from the fern and on their structure analysis. Previously, these additional Chl&#8208;catabolites escaped their characterization, since they exist in aqueous media as mixtures of equilibrating isomers. However, their chemical dehydration furnished stable iPB&#8208;derivatives that allowed the delineation of the enigmatic structures and chemistry of the original natural catabolites. The structures of all fern&#8208;iPBs reflect the early core steps of a PaO/PB&#8208;type pathway and the PB&#8208;to&#8208;iPB carbon skeleton rearrangement. A striking further degradative chemical ring&#8208;cleavage was observed, proposed to consume singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hence, Chl&#8208;catabolites may play a novel active role in detoxifying cellular 1O2. The critical deviations from the PaO/PB pathway, found in the fern, reflect evolutionary developments of Chl&#8208;breakdown in the green plants in the Paleozoic era.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism of a Chiral Triplet Nitrene Investigated Under Matrix&#8208;Isolation Conditions in Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral triplet nitrene was photochemically generated from the parent azide compound and characterized by means of matrix&#8208;isolation vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy. Despite the high&#8208;spin nature of the target compound, no intensity enhancement was observed, and we show that matrix&#8208;isolation VCD spectra of high&#8208;spin organic radicals can indeed be computed.







Abstract
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of chiral high&#8208;spin organic radicals are expected to show a strong intensity enhancement and are thought to be difficult to predict using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical methods. Herein we show that the chiral triplet nitrene obtained from photochemical cleavage of N2 from enantiopure 2&#8208;azido&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorenol does not feature extraordinarily strong intensities and that the experimental spectra match nicely with calculated ones. Thereby, this study demonstrates the general feasibility of studies on chiral high&#8208;spin organics by matrix&#8208;isolation VCD.

         <title>Recyclable Homogeneous Catalysis Enabled by Dynamic Coordination on Rhodium(II) Axial Sites of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activity of catalytic nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their surface chemistry, which controls colloidal stability and substrate diffusion toward catalytic sites. In this work, we studied how the outer surface chemistry of nanostructured Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) impacts their performance in homogeneous catalysis. Specifically, through post&#8208;synthetic coordination of aliphatic imidazole ligands onto the exohedral Rh(II) axial sites of Rh&#8208;MOPs, we solubilized a cuboctahedral Rh&#8208;MOP in dichloromethane, thereby enabling its use as a homogeneous catalyst. We demonstrated that the presence of the coordinating ligand on the surface of the Rh&#8208;MOP does not hinder its catalytic activity in styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions, thanks to the dynamic Rh&#8208;imidazole coordination bond. Finally, we used similar ligand exchange post&#8208;synthetic reactions to develop a ligand&#8208;mediated approach for precipitating the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating the recovery and reuse of Rh&#8208;MOPs as homogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem four&#8208;component reaction to access fused polycycles exhibiting aggregation&#8208;enhanced through&#8208;space charge transfer emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid construction of new fluorescence emitters is essential in advancing synthetic luminescent materials. This study illustrated a piperidine&#8208;promoted reaction of chiral dialdehyde with benzoylacetonitrile and malonitrile, leading to the formation of the 6/6/7 fused cyclic product in good yield. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a dual condensation/cyclization process, achieving the formation of up to six bonds for fused polycycles. The single crystal structure analysis revealed that the fused cyclic skeleton contains face&#8208;to&#8208;face naphthyl and cyanoalkenyl motifs, which act as the electronic donor and acceptor, respectively, potentially resulting in through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emission. While the TSCT emissions were weak in solution, a notable increase in luminescence intensity was observed upon aggregation, indicating bright fluorescent light. A series of theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication based on frontier molecular orbitals, the distance of charge transfer, and reduced density gradient analysis. This work not only provides guidance for the one&#8208;step synthesis of complex polycycles, but also offers valuable insights into the design of aggregation&#8208;enhanced TSCT emission materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the complete structure of noble metal nanoclusters is both academically and practically significant. However, progress has been hindered by the low synthetic efficiency of many nanocluster syntheses. In this study, we present the first high&#8208;throughput syntheses of homo&#8208;gold, homo&#8208;copper, and gold&#8208;copper alloy nanoclusters in dichloromethane at room temperature. Through high&#8208;throughput screening, we successfully obtained three nanoclusters in a single reaction: Au18(SC6H11)14, [Au41Cu66(SC6H11)44](SbF6)3, and an unidentified copper cluster (referred to as Au18, Au41Cu66, and Cu&#8208;NC). The optimized synthesis route was achieved with the assistance of machine learning for experimental data analysis, which also guided the synthesis of other metal nanoclusters such as Au40Cu34(4&#8208;S&#8208;PhF)40 (Au40Cu34), [Au6Cu6(SPh)12]n ([Au6Cu6]n), and Au18Cu32(3,5&#8208;C8H9S)36 (Au18Cu32)). This research demonstrates that high&#8208;throughput screening can be a valuable tool in accelerating the development of nanocluster syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Hosts for the Sensing and Separation of 99TcO4 &#8208;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, European Union member states have hastened energy policy deliberations to address supply and sustainability concerns, placing a significant emphasis on nuclear energy as a means to achieve decarbonization goals. However, despite its significant role in power generation, nuclear energy faces significant challenges linked to fuel reprocessing and waste disposal, that hinder its broader expansion. In this context, the separation of technetium represents a concerning issue. Indeed, technetium's catalytic activity can impede the extraction of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium, affecting waste reprocessing efficiency. Additionally, the stable form of technetium in aerobic conditions, pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;), poses risks of groundwater contamination due to its mobility and solubility. Hence, sensing and separation of TcO4&#8722; is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and minimising radioactive contamination in the environment. However, the binding of TcO4&#8722; and its separation from contaminated solutions present challenges due to the acidic (or basic) waste components and the high ionic strength in real matrices. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation (using extraction and sorption) with a focus on molecular hosts. Metal&#8208;organic receptors will also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Magnesium Binding Site And The Anomeric Effect Regulate The Abiotic Redox Chemistry Of Nicotinamide Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NAD(H) and nicotinamide mononucleotide are capable of mediating model protometabolic electron transfer reactions, whereas simpler analogues are not. Early enzyme&#8208;like catalysts likely exploited molecules that possessed a nicotinamide, an anomeric position, and a Mg2+&#8208;binding site, as found in nicotinamide&#8208;containing molecules in biology today.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox active molecule that is universally found in biology. Despite the importance and simplicity of this molecule, few reports exist that investigate which molecular features are important for the activity of this ribodinucleotide. By exploiting the nonenzymatic reduction and oxidation of NAD+ by pyruvate and methylene blue, respectively, we were able to identify key molecular features necessary for the intrinsic activity of NAD+ through kinetic analysis. Such features may explain how NAD+ could have been selected early during the emergence of life. Simpler molecules, such as nicotinamide, that lack an anomeric carbon are incapable of accepting electrons from pyruvate. The phosphate moiety inhibits activity in the absence of metal ions but facilitates activity at physiological pH and model prebiotic conditions by recruiting catalytic Mg2+. Reduction proceeds through consecutive single electron transfer events. Of the derivatives tested, including nicotinamide mononucleotide, nicotinamide riboside, 3&#8208;(aminocarbonyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropyl)pyridinium, 1&#8208;methylnicotinamide, and nicotinamide, only NAD+ and nicotinamide mononucleotide would be capable of efficiently accepting and donating electrons within a nonenzymatic electron transport chain. The data are consistent with early metabolic chemistry exploiting NAD+ or nicotinamide mononucleotide and not simpler molecules.

         <title>Modulating the Coordination Chemistry of Cobalt Catalytic Sites by Ruthenium Species to Accelerate the Polysulfide Conversion Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8722;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Additionally, introducing Ru in the Co&#8722;NC matrix provided additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8722;Nx species to manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides.







Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is compromised by the loss of sulfur as dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte and consequently the polysulfide redox shutting effect. Accelerating the conversion kinetics of polysulfide intermediates into sulfur or lithium sulfide through electrocatalysis has emerged as a root&#8208;cause solution. Co&#8722;N&#8722;C composite electrocatalyst is commonly used for this purpose. It is illustrated here that how the effectiveness can be improved by modulating the coordination chemistry of Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites through introducing Ru species (RuCo&#8722;NC). The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8722;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Using Ru to modulate the electronic structure in the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C configuration and the additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8722;Nx species can manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with RuCo&#8722;NC can reduce the capacity fade rate from 0.11&#8201;% per cycle without catalyst (initial capacity of 701&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 0.054&#8201;% per cycle (initial capacity of 1074&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) over 400 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C rate. The results of this study provide the evidence for a feasible catalyst modification strategy for the polysulfide electrocatalysis.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Remote Thiocyanation Reaction via Ring&#8208;Opening Functionalization of Cycloalkanols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced remote alkyl thiocyanation via ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cycloalkanols with the electrophilic N&#8208;thiocyanatosaccharin has been developed. A series of valuable ketones with remote thiocyanato substituent have been efficiently synthesized without transition metals and oxidants in moderate to good yields. This protocol provides possibility for the synthesis of some bioactive compounds with remote thiocyanato groups.







Abstract
The remote C(sp3)&#8208;SCN bond formation via ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cycloalkanols with N&#8208;thiocyanatosaccharin as the precursor of SCN radicals and pyrylium salt as the organic photocatalyst under visible light has been developed. Thus, various terminal keto thiocyanates were prepared without transition metals and oxidants in moderate to good yields. The simplicity, wide substrate scope and mild conditions feature its synthetic application capability.

         <title>Silyliumylidene Ion Stabilized by Two &#963;&#8208;Donating Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silyliumylidene ion stabilized by two Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;donating ligands was synthesized. Its particular coordination mode was characterized by a pyramidalized silicon center with a lone pair. Interestingly, a ligand exchange reaction leads to a significant change in the coordination mode to form a metal&#8208;based donor/acceptor&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ion, characterized by a vacant orbital at the Si center. Despite the stabilization by the two metal ligands, the silyliumylidene complex remains highly reactive.







Abstract
A silyliumylidene ion 2 stabilized by two &#963;&#8208;donating Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;fragments was successfully synthesized. Due to the &#963;&#8208;donation of M&#8594;Si interactions, 2 presents a pyramidalized cationic silicon center with a localized lone pair. The additional coordination of basic Pd(0) fragment to the mono&#8208;Ni(0)&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene 1 results in a higher HOMO level and an unchanged HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and thus, 2 remains highly reactive. Interestingly, the coordination mode at the Si center is closely related to the nature of M&#8208;ligands. Indeed, the donor/donor&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ion 2 has been transformed into a donor/acceptor&#8208;stabilized ion 13, featuring a trigonal planar Si center with a vacant orbital, just via a ligand exchange reaction from PCy3/NHC toward PMe3.

         <title>Asymmetric and Chemoselective Iridium Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Conjugated Unsaturated Oxime ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on the chemoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of conjugated p&#8208;systems has mostly been focussed on enones. Herein, we communicate the understudied asymmetric hydrogenation of enimines catalyzed by N,P&#8208;iridium complexes and chemoselective toward the alkene. A number of enoxime ethers underwent hydrogenation smoothly to yield the desired products in high yield and stereopurity (up to 99% yield, up to 99% ee). No hydrogenation of the C=N p&#8208;bond was observed under the applied reaction conditions (20 bar H2, rt, DCM). It was demonstrated that the chiral oxime ether could be hydrolyzed into the ketone with complete preservation of the installed stereogenity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon. At last, a binding mode of the substrate to the active iridium catalyst and the consequence for the stereoselective outcome was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Migration of Condensed Aromatic Hydrocarbons During Alkyne&#8208;Vinylidene&#160;Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylacetylenes ArC&#186;CAr featuring condensed aromatic hydrocarbon fragments (Ar) such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene were converted into vinylidene ligands by 1,2&#8208;migration reactions within the coordination sphere of half&#8208;sandwich complexes [MII(dppe)Cp]+ (MII = RuII, FeII). Comparison of the extent of conversion of the alkyne substrates to the vinylidene complexes [Ru{=C=CAr2}(dppe)Cp]+ with those obtained from acetylenes functionalized by smaller groups (H, CH3, Ph) show that the molecular volume (VM) of the migrating group and relief of steric congestion plays a role during the rearrangement process. Conversely, the H&#8208;atoms from the larger condensed ring aryl groups that are in close proximity to the migrating sites also have a significant influence on the efficacy and extent of the reaction by restricting access of the alkyne to the metal center, resulting in a less effective migration reaction. This combination of competing steric factors (acceleration due to relief of steric congestion and restricted access of the alkyne moiety to the reaction site) is exemplified by the facile migration of 1&#8208;pyryl entities and the low yields of vinylidene products formed from 1,2&#8208;bis(9&#8208;anthryl)acetylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Bis&#8208;Acridinium Tweezer Equilibria Controlled by Multi&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protonated and methylated bis&#8208;acridinium tweezers built around a 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridyl and an electron enriched 2,6&#8208;di(p&#8208;anisyl)pyridyl spacer have been synthesized. These tweezers can self&#8208;assemble in their corresponding homodimers and the associated thermodynamic parameters have been probed in organic solvents. The switching properties of the tweezers have been exploited in biphasic transfer experiments showing the shift of the equilibria towards the homodimers. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters of the formation of the reduced methylated homodimers investigated by electrochemical experiments revealed the dissociation of the dimers. Thus, in addition to solvent and temperature, the pH and redox responsiveness of the acridinium units of the tweezers make it possible to modulate to a larger extent the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Potential Drug Targets of Calix[4]arene by Reverse Docking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calixarenes are displaying great potential for the development of new drug delivery systems, diagnostic imaging, biosensing devices and inhibitors of biological processes. In particular, calixarene derivatives are able to interact with many different enzymes and function as inhibitors. By screening of the potential drug target database (PDTD) with a reverse docking procedure, we identify and discuss a selection of 100 proteins that interact strongly with calix[4]arene. We also discover that leucine (23.5%), isoleucine (11.3%), phenylalanines (11.3%) and valine (9.5%) are the most frequent binding residues followed by hydrophobic cysteines and methionines and aromatic histidines, tyrosines and tryptophanes. Top binders are peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptors that already&#160;are&#160;targeted by commercial drugs, demonstrating the practical interest in calix[4]arene. Nuclear receptors, potassium channel, several carrier proteins, a variety of cancer&#8208;related proteins and viral proteins are prominent in the list. It is concluded that calix[4]arene, which is characterized by facile access, well&#8208;defined conformational characteristics, and ease of functionalization at both the lower and higher rims, could be a potential lead compound for the development of enzyme inhibitors and theranostic platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenolysis of Cationic Half&#8208;Sandwich Zinc Complexes Containing a Chelating Amine: Facile Cleavage of Zinc&#8208;Carbon Bond by Dihydrogen To Give Zinc Hydride Cations</title>

         <title>CoPS/Co 4 S 3 Heterojunction&#160;with Highly Exposed Active Sites and Dual&#8208;site Synergy for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) has recently been recognized as a potentially effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there have been no research on the design of CoPS&#8208;based heterojunctions to boost their HER performance.&#160;Herein, CoPS/Co4S3&#160;heterojunction&#160;was&#160;prepared by phosphating treatment based on defect&#8208;rich flower&#8208;like Co1&#8208;xS precursors. The high specific surface area of nanopetals, together with the heterojunction structure with inhomogeneous strain, exposes more active sites in the catalyst.&#160;The electronic structure of the catalyst is reconfigured as a result of the interfacial interactions, which promote the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen and conduct electricity. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site&#160;further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70 mV&#160;to attain&#160;a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which renders it competitive with previously reported analogous&#160;catalysts. This work proposes an effective technique for constructing transition metal phosphosulfide heterojunctions, as well as the development of an efficient HER electrocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Induction in a Self&#8208;Assembled Pd4 Coordination Cage with Chiral Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of achiral precursors, cis&#8208;(tmen)Pd(NO3)2 and C2&#8208;symmetric ligand produces a racemic mixture of chiral octahedral cage. The cage encapsulates several hydrophobic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions with the aromatic walls. Intermolecular chiral induction has been achieved by encapsulation of enantiopure chiral guests within the cage resulting selective formation of a single homochiral assembly.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of coordination bonds within metal&#8208;organic cages offers a unique avenue for structural evolution in response to external stimuli, presenting a promising strategy for the construction of chiral assemblies. This adaptability is crucial for the selective synthesis of homochiral assemblies and advancement of asymmetric catalysis. In this study, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral square&#8208;planar Pd(II) acceptor with a C2&#8208;symmetric tetrapyridyl donor resulted in the formation of a racemic mixture of the chiral octahedral cage Pd4L2. The existence of this racemic mixture was confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We encoded chiral information into the asymmetric cavity of the cage by encapsulating chiral aromatic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media. The inclusion of a chiral guest induces a preference for one enantiomeric conformation of the cage over the other, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards a single, enantiopure host&#8208;guest complex. While the concept of chiral guest recognition by a chiral host is well&#8208;established, this work constitutes a remarkable example of guest&#8208;mediated chirality transfer leading to the formation of a single enantiopure coordination complex from achiral building blocks.

         <title>Controlling the Uptake and Release of Semiochemicals in Channel&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Through Pore Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of Zr(IV)&#8208; and Al(III)&#8208;based MOFs containing sequentially expanded 1D&#8208;channel pores were investigated for the uptake and controlled release of semiochemicals. Through pore expansion, control over the degree of uptake and release dynamics of these biological messenger molecules was achieved, with the stability of these frameworks allowing for regeneration and re&#8208;use with near identical re&#8208;release profiles.







Abstract
Semiochemicals can be used to manipulate insect behaviour for sustainable pest management strategies, but their high volatility is a major issue for their practical implementation. Inclusion of these molecules within porous materials is a potential solution to this issue, as it can allow for a slower and more controlled release. In this work, we demonstrate that a series of Zr(IV) and Al(III) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with channel&#8208;type pores enable controlled release of three semiochemicals over 100&#8197;days by pore size design, with the uptake and rate of release highly dependent on the pore size. Insight from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations indicates that this is due to weaker MOF&#8208;guest interactions per guest molecule as the pore size increases. These MOFs are all stable post&#8208;release and can be reloaded to show near&#8208;identical re&#8208;release profiles. These results provide valuable insight on the diffusion behaviour of volatile guests in MOFs, and for the further development of porous materials for sustainable agriculture applications.

         <title>Enhancing Control Over Nitric Oxide Photorelease via a Molecular Keypad Lock</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular keypad lock based on a ruthenium nitrito complex allows for the double&#8208;secure release of the bioactive nitric oxide molecule. The sequential introduction of protons and light to the system results in the release of nitric oxide whose concentration is predicted using an artificial intelligence model.







Abstract
Based on Boolean logic, molecular keypad locks secure molecular information, typically with an optical output. Here we investigate a rare example of a molecular keypad lock with a chemical output. To this end, the light&#8208;activated release of biologically important nitric oxide from a ruthenium complex is studied, using proton concentration and photon flux as inputs. In a pH&#8208;dependent equilibrium, a nitritoruthenium(II) complex is turned into a nitrosylruthenium(II) complex, which releases nitric oxide under irradiation with visible light. The precise prediction of the output nitric oxide concentration as function of the pH and photon flux is achieved with an artificial intelligence approach, namely the adaptive neuro&#8208;fuzzy inference system. In this manner an exceptionally high level of control over the output concentration is obtained. Moreover, the provided concept to lock a chemical output as well as the output prediction may be applied to other (photo)release schemes.

         <title>Detection and Characterization of Hydride Ligands in Copper Complexes by Hard X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>

Discover how X&#8208;ray absorption and X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy analyses unveil insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydride complexes. The integration of experimental and theoretical approaches offers a holistic approach in detecting and characterizing hydride ligands in copper complexes.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes, particularly copper hydrides, play an important role in various catalytic processes and molecular inorganic chemistry. This study employs synchrotron hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to gain insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydrides as potential catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The potential of high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (HERFD&#8208;XANES) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission (VtC&#8208;XES) is demonstrated with measurement on Stryker's reagent (Cu6H6) and [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;H)(dpmppe)2](PF6)2 (Cu3H), alongside a non&#8208;hydride copper compound ICu(dtbppOH) (Cuy&#8722;I). The XANES analysis reveals that coordination geometries strongly influence the spectra, providing only indirect details about hydride coordination. The VtC&#8208;XES analysis exhibits a distinct signal around 8975&#8197;eV, offering a diagnostic tool to identify hydride ligands. Theoretical calculations support and extend these findings by comparing hydride&#8208;containing complexes with their hydride&#8208;free counterparts.

         <title>Hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 Encapsulated Pd Catalysts for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited satisfactory selectivity and stability in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFA) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) is regarded as attractive transformation to achieve the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass resources. However, the conventional supported catalysts are significantly restricted by their narrow pore size, ununiform dispersion and easy leaching or aggregation of catalytic sites. Herein, we designed hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as the support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) to achieve the highly active and selective conversion of FFA to FA. Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited 96.8&#8201;% conversion of FFA with satisfactory selectivity reaching up to 92.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C, 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 in isopropanol solvent within 6&#8197;h. More importantly, as&#8208;prepared Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 catalyst exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, as well as good universality toward a series of hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

Meso&#8208;nitrile oxide group in 1,7&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;containing BODIPYs undergoes an unusual [3+2] intramolecular cycloaddition reaction with the formation of the dihydrobenzo[d]isoxazole&#8208;containing BODIPYs. Oxidation of these compounds results in the formation of unprecedented either benzisoxazole&#8208; or benzo[b]azepine&#8208;fused fully conjugated NIR absorbing BODIPYs.

         <title>Generation, Characterization and Reactivity of a High&#8208;Valent Mononuclear Cobalt(IV)&#8722;Diazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of azide to a Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex results in the replacement of both nitrate ligands to form a Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species. The azide interacts with Co(IV) more strongly than nitrate, leading to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the basicity of azide, Co(IV)&#8722;diazide has a higher driving force than Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate species to activate substrate C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent Fe(IV)=O intermediates of metalloenzymes have inspired numerous efforts to generate synthetic analogs to mimic and understand their substrate oxidation reactivities. However, high&#8208;valent M(IV) complexes of late transition metals are rare. We have recently reported a novel Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex (1&#8208;NO3) that activates sp3 C&#8722;H bonds up to 87&#8197;kcal/mol. In this work, we have shown that the nitrate ligands in 1&#8208;NO3 can be replaced by azide, a more basic coordinating base, resulting in the formation of a more potent Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species (1&#8208;N3) that reacts with substrates (hydrocarbons and phenols) at faster rate constants and activates stronger C&#8722;H bonds than the parent complex 1&#8208;NO3. We have characterized 1&#8208;N3 employing a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches. Our results clearly show that the coordination of azide leads to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the higher basicity of azide, these thermodynamic parameters contribute to the higher driving forces of 1&#8208;N3 than 1&#8208;NO3 for C&#8722;H bond activation. Our discoveries are thus insightful for designing more reactive bio&#8208;inspired high&#8208;valent late transition metal complexes for activating inert aliphatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Silver(i) Perfluoroalcoholates: Synthesis, Structure, and their Use as Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable fluorinated groups are an opportunity for the future, as ECHA is considering the regulation of persistent PFAS in the coming years. Therefore, the OCF3 group is emerging as a degradable group for a variety of applications, while higher perfluoroalkoxy groups are still of interest for agrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. The silver(I) perfluoroalcoholates can provide valuable reagents for incorporation into organic molecules.







Abstract
Herein we report a general access to silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates, their structure in the solid state and in solution, and their use as transfer reagents. The silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates are prepared by the reaction of AgF with the corresponding perfluorinated carbonyl compounds in acetonitrile and are stable for a prolonged time at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of perfluoroalcoholate species showed that two Ag(i) centers are bridged by the alcoholate ligands. In acetonitrile solution, Ag[OCF3] forms different structures as indicated by IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates can be used as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reagents for the synthesis of Cu[OCF3], Cu[OC2F5], [PPh4][Au(CF3)3(OCF3)], and fluorinated alkyl ethers.

         <title>Classification and Identification of Perfume Scents by an Enantioselective Colorimetric Sensor Array of Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric sensor array made of Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot films based on different chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks is presented. The color changes as response to analyte vapor molecules. The sensors respond enantioselectively for chiral vapor molecules. In combination with a common smartphone camera, the sensor array is used as simple and cost&#8208;efficient system to detect and identify a large number of perfume samples.







Abstract
Many odors, like perfumes, are complex mixtures of chiral and achiral molecules where the cost&#8208;efficient (enantio&#8722;)selective sensing represents a major technical challenge. Here, we present a colorimetric sensor array of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (SURMOF) films in Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities. The optical properties of the FP&#8208;SURMOF films with different chiral and achiral structures are affected by the (enantio&#8722;)selective adsorption of the analytes in the SURMOF pores, resulting in different responses to the analyte molecules. The read&#8208;out of the sensor array is performed by the digital camera of a common smartphone, where the RGB values are determined. By analyzing the sensor array data with simple machine learning algorithms, the analytes are discriminated. After demonstrating the enantioselective response for a pair of pure chiral odor molecules, we apply the sensor array to detect and discriminate a large number (16) of common commercial perfumes and eau de toilettes. While our untrained human nose is not able to discriminate all perfumes, the presented colorimetric sensor array can classify all perfumes with great classification accuracy. Moreover, the sensor array was used to identify unlabeled samples correctly. We foresee such an FP&#8208;chiral&#8208;SURMOF&#8208;based sensor array as a powerful approach toward inexpensive selective odors sensing applications.

         <title>Effect of Co&#8208;Adsorbed Guest Adsorbates on the Separation of Ethylene/Ethane Mixtures on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Open Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR renders the direct determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in the presence of guest adsorbates (H2O, CO2 and O2) on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions in the ternary mixture systems were unraveled from 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation MAS&#8197;NMR and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments.







Abstract
Direct determination of the equilibrium adsorption and spectroscopic observation of adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction is crucial to evaluate the olefin/paraffin separation performance of porous adsorbents. However, the experimental characterization of competitive adsorption of various adsorbates at atomic&#8208;molecular level in the purification of multicomponent gas mixtures is challenging and rarely conducted. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is employed to examine the effect of co&#8208;adsorbed guest adsorbates on the separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. 1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR facilitates the determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in ternary mixtures. The co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2 significantly leads to the degradation of ethylene uptake and ethylene/ethane selectivity. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions are unraveled by 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments. The experimental results verify H2O coordinated on open metal sites can supply a new adsorption site for ethylene and ethane. The effects of guest adsorbates on the adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane mixtures are in the following order: H2O&gt;CO2&gt;O2. This work provides a direct approach for exploring the equilibrium adsorption and detailed separation mechanism of multicomponent gas mixtures using MOFs adsorbents.

         <title>A Triply Linked Copper(III) Dicarbacorrole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer was synthesized from a meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor via an oxidative fusion reaction. The dimer is capable of stabilizing high&#8208;valent Cu(III) cations and show distinct NIR absorptions.







Abstract
A triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer (7) was synthesized from a new meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor (6) via an oxidative fusion reaction by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 7 adopts a flat conformation with a length as ca. 15.946&#8197;&#197; and a width as 6.903&#8197;&#197;, which can be regarded as a short carbaporphyrinoid tape. Two coordinated Cu ions keeps the +3 oxidation state in 7, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is in sharp contrast to the Osuka's triply linked tetrapyrrolic corrole dimers, where the inner 3NH form is not stable and thus can only act as a divalent ligand. Due to the non&#8208;aromatic nature of dicarbacorrole macrocycle, the largely decreased HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of 7 are best ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between two dipyrromethene&#8208;type chromophores. To our knowledge, this is the first fully fused carbaporphyrinoid dimer with &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linkages prepared to date.

         <title>U(V) stabilization via aliovalent incorporation of Ln(III) into oxo&#8208;salt framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentavalent uranium compounds are key components of uranium&#8216;s redox chemistry and play important roles in environmental transport. Despite this, well&#8208;characterized U(V) compounds are scarce primarily because of their instability with respect to disproportionation to U(IV) and U(VI). In this work, we provide an alternate route to incorporation of U(V) into a crystalline lattice where different oxidation states of uranium can be stabilized through the incorporation of secondary cations with different sizes and charges. We show that iriginite&#8208;based crystalline layers allow for systematically replacing U(VI) with U(V) through aliovalent substitution of 2+ alkaline&#8208;earth or 3+ rare&#8208;earth cations as dopant ions under high&#8208;temperature conditions, specifically Ca(UVIO2)W4O14 and Ln(UVO2)W4O14 (Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb). Evidence for the existence of U(V) and U(VI) is supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorption spectroscopy. In contrast with other reported U(V) materials, the U(V) single crystals obtained using this route are relatively large (several centimeters) and easily reproducible, and thus provide a substantial improvement in the facile synthesis and stabilization of U(V).</dc:description>

         <title>Three Perovskite Phases with Different Cation Orders in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation order, which can be controlled by synthesis conditions and stoichiometry, plays an important role in properties of perovskite materials. Here we show that aliovalent doping by Sb5+ in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 quadruple perovskite solid solutions can control cation orders in both A and B sites. Samples with 0.4 &#8804; x &#8804; 2 were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature method at 6 GPa and 1770 K. Three regions with different cation orders were found at 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0, x = 1.5&#8211;1.6, and x = 1.8. The 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0 compositions have a B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/nmc; the x = 1.5 and 1.6 samples have a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/n; the x = 1.8 sample has a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered structure with space group P21/n. All the samples show one ferrimagnetic transition: TC increases from 35 K to 73 K for 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0, TC = 81 K for x = 1.5 and 1.6, and TC = 53 K for x = 1.8.</dc:description>

         <title>A Type of Stable Amides Behaves as Acyl Transfer Reagents upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation through&#160;Self&#8208;aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules with light&#8208;modifiable reactivity are important in many fields because they can serve as the &#8220;switch&#8221; for light to trigger chemical processes. Herein, we disclose a new type of stable non&#8208;twisted amides, the reactivity of which can be turned on by light as acyl transfer reagents. Upon photo&#8208;activation, these amides react with various nucleophiles including amines, phenols, hydroxide, thiols, boronic acids, and alkynes either under metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reactivity hinges on the design and synthesis of a photo&#8208;activatable reagent (7&#8208;nitro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrophenanthridine), which undergoes self&#8208;aromatization enabled by an internal oxidant under light. This masked acyl donor group is anticipated to be useful in scenarios where light is preferred to trigger a chemical process.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Radicals Featuring B&#8208; and N&#8208;Embedded Dioxygen&#8208;Bridged Units: Synthesis, Structures, and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tris(2,4,6trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) group has been widely used for constructing organic radicals, but the poor optical stabilities limit the application prospects of the TTM radicals. In this work, the rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged (BO and NO) units were attached to the TTM skeleton as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups, respectively. The rigidity and strong electronic effect of the BO and NO units contribute to the high chemical and optical stability of BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM radicals. Notably, NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55 nm (100 meV), while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635 nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43 nm (130 meV). This study has developed a methodology to produce highly efficient and enduring luminescent radicals, which could tune emission properties such as wavelength and FWHM.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of CO2 Activation: Insights into Metal&#8208;Metal Cooperativity and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling with {3d&#8211;4f} Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 into useful chemicals using metal catalysts is a significant challenge in chemistry. Among the various catalysts reported, transition metal lanthanide hybrid {3d&#8208;4f} complexes stand out for their superior efficiency and site selectivity. However, unlike transition metal catalysts, understanding the origin of this efficiency in lanthanides poses a challenge due to their orbital degeneracy, rendering the application of DFT methods ineffective. In this study, we employed a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations to explore the mechanism of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate using a 3d&#8208;4f heterometallic catalyst for the first time. This work unveils the importance of 3d and 4f metal cooperativity and the role of individual spin&#8208;orbit states in dictating the overall efficiency of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis and Recovery of Single Crystals of the Metastable Manganese Carbide, MnCx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal carbides find widespread use throughout industry due to their high strength and resilience under extreme conditions. However, they remain largely limited to compounds formed from the early d&#8208;block elements, since the mid&#8208;to&#8208;late transition metals do not form thermodynamically stable carbides. We report here the high&#8208;pressure bulk synthesis of large single crystals of a novel metastable manganese carbide compound,MnCxP63/mmc, which adopts the anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type structure with significant substoichiometry at the carbon sites. We demonstrate how synthesis pressure modulates the carbon loading, with~40% occupancy being achieved at 9.9 GPa.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved access to potent anticancer tubulysins and linker&#8208;functionalized payloads via an all&#8208;on&#8208;resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tubulysins are among the most recent antimitotic compounds to enter into antibody/peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC/PDC) development. Thus far, the design of the most promising tubulysin payloads relied on simplifying their structures, e.g., by using small tertiary amide N&#8208;substituents (Me, Et, Pr) on tubuvaline residue. Cumbersome solution&#8208;phase approaches are typically used for both syntheses and functionalization with cleavable linkers. p&#8208;Aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium (PABQ) linkers were a remarkable advancement for targeted delivery, but the procedures to incorporate them into tubulysins are only of moderate efficiency. Here we describe a novel all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy permitting a loss&#8208;free resin linkage and an improved access to super potent tubulysin analogs showing close resemblance to the natural compounds. For the first time, a protocol enables the integration of on&#8208;resin tubulysin derivatization with, e.g., a maleimido&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PABQ linker, which is a notable progress for the payload&#8208;PABQ&#8208;linker technology. The strategy also allows tubulysin diversification of the internal amide N&#8208;substituent, thus enabling to screen a tubulysin library for the discovery of new potent analogs. This work provides ADC/PDC developers with new tools for both rapid access to new derivatives and easier linker&#8208;attachment and functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Decarboxylation of Proline&#8208;Derived Building Blocks for Protein&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a set of conformationally restricted Proline&#8208;derived Modules (ProMs), our group has recently succeeded in developing inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator&#8208;stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain, which is a key mediator of cell migration and plays an important role in tumor metastasis. While these (formally) pentapeptidic compounds show nanomolecular binding affinities towards EVH1, their drug&#8208;like properties and cell permea&#173;bility need to be further optimized before they can be clinically tested as therapeutic agents against metastasis. In this study, we sought to improve these properties by removing the C&#8208;terminal carboxylic acid function of our peptoids, either by late&#8208;stage decarboxylation or by direct synthesis. For late&#8208;stage decarboxy&#173;lation of ProM&#8208;like systems, a method for reductive halo decarboxylation was optimized and applied to several proline&#8208;derived substrates. In this way, a series of new decarboxy ProMs suitable as building blocks for decarboxy EVH1 inhibitors were obtained. In addition, we incorporated decarboxy&#8208;ProM&#8208;1 into the penta&#173;peptide&#8208;like compound Ac[2&#8208;Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][Decarb&#8208;ProM&#8208;1], which showed similar affinity towards EVH1 as the methyl ester derivative (Ac[2&#8208;Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][ProM1]OMe). However, despite better calculated drug&#8208;like properties, this compound did not inhibit chemotaxis in a cellular assay.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a method for the synthesis of various 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;ones that exploits the specific reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene framework, which is generated under silylating reaction conditions from a 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione bearing the picolinoyloxy group at the 2' position of its C&#8208;2 side chain. Our reaction system generates a carbocation via the release of the acyloxy group, forms a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton via the intramolecular attack at the resulting carbocation by a silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbon in the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene moiety, and induces the skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core. This novel transformation of a 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione moiety can be developed for the synthesis of other bicyclic frameworks fused to cyclopentenones.</dc:description>

Our reaction system generates a carbocation via the release of the acyloxy group, forms a 4,5-cis-fused ring skeleton via the intramolecular attack at the resulting carbocation by a silyloxy-substituted carbon in the 1,4-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-cyclopentadiene moiety, and induces the skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core. This novel transformation of a 1,3-cyclopentanedione moiety can be developed for the synthesis of other bicyclic frameworks fused to cyclopentenones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
