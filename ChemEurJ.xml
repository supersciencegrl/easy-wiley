Through a new method of low&#8208;temperature (only 350&#8201;&#176;C) self&#8208;reduction, a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ was prepared, with a high PLQY of 95&#8201;% and a color purity of 97.6&#8201;%. Then, a WLED fabricated by the as&#8208;prepared CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ presents outstanding performance with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9&#8197;lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K.







Abstract
Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+). The crystal structure, morphology, chemical state, and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor have been investigated. By using the screened hybrid function (HSE06), the band gap (Eg) of CBH was calculated to be 7.48&#8197;eV, which is a necessary condition for achieving high quantum yield phosphors. The experiment results show that almost all the added raw materials of Eu3+ can be reduced to Eu2+ in CBH crystal under a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor shows a broad excitation spectrum centered at 277 and 327&#8197;nm in the range of 220 to 400&#8197;nm, and a narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428&#8197;nm in the range of 400 to 500&#8197;nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35&#8197;nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0&#8201;%), high external quantum efficiency (EQE=31.1&#8201;%), and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6&#8201;%). The PL intensity of CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ remains 62.6&#8201;% of the initial intensity at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+, excited by a 365&#8197;nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K. The above results show that CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ can be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to design and prepare other new types of highly efficient phosphors.

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13870-13878, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties by creating a &#960;&#8208;hole. In the adduct pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde the presence of fluorine atoms exchanges the electron donor&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to those observed in the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct.







Abstract
The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the 13C and 15N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions.

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;Zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13730-13738, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket mimicking the constrains induced by a proteic structure was probed by 1D EXSY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. Results highlight: i) the very high kinetic stability of a tetrahedral ZnII centre when coordination of a fifth ligand is precluded by the environment, ii) the necessary associative double&#8208;exchange mechanism for ligand exchange, and iii) the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing the exchange.







Abstract
In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic ZnII centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of ZnII in proteins.

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>

         <dc:description>
The original molecular crystals containing cationic amphiphiles with azobenzene and disulfide groups showed different phase transitions depending on the application order of a reduction agent and light irradiation. The current molecular system can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.







Abstract
There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, molecular crystals were prepared that contained a cationic amphiphile bearing azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.

         <title>Electroresponsive Performances of Ecoresorbable Smart Fluids Consisting of Various Plant&#8208;Derived Carrier Liquids</title>

Vegetable and mineral: Ecoresorbable smart fluids consisting of various plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids and Mg&#8208;doped SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles exert superb electroresponsive properties with outstanding polarizability, wettability, and dispersion stability. By examining the performance of smart fluids composed of various oils, it is possible to provide deeper insights into the influence of medium on electroresponsive behavior. The proposed electrorheological fluids are nontoxic and can solve environmental problems.







Abstract
This paper proposes the fabrication of a new type of electrorheological (ER) fluid with ecoresorbable features as well as excellent electroresponsive performance. The proposed ER fluid consists of biocompatible Mg&#8208;doped silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (ST HNPs) suspended in vegetable oils (canola, grapeseed, olive, and soy). The effects of biodegradable plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids on the ER performance are analyzed. The polarizability and wettability of the fabricated ER fluids are studied. The high polarizability of the nanoparticles contributes to the highly electroresponsive performance by inducing electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles under electric fields; this enables the formation of a rigid and strong fibril structure. A suitable wettability, which represents the favorable interaction between the oil and the nanoparticles, allows the nanoparticles to disperse evenly in the oil and prevents their aggregation, thereby making the formation of a rigid and strong fibrillar structure under the electric field easier.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines through Aryne Three&#8208;Component Coupling</title>

Getting into position: Aryne multicomponent coupling triggered by pyridines allows the broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines bearing a &#8722;CF3 group by engaging &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be used as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway.







Abstract
The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol by using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated. The reaction allowed a broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives bearing the &#8722;CF3 group in good yields with &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway. Nucleophilic attack by the initially generated pyridylidene intermediate on the carbonyl followed by an SNAr process resembling the Smiles rearrangement affords the desired products.

Squeezed to change: We demonstrate that a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered metal complex with remote phenyl rings can undergo reversible pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events.







Abstract
Understanding the factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity to the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergoing pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events. The observed phase transitions illustrate the key role of an interplay between the low&#8208;energy conformation perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.

Heterofullerene tailoring: The inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; bisadduct of azafullerene has been synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern, and 13C NMR spectroscopy showed C1 symmetry. The bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the enantiomers was probed by CD spectroscopy. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption and electrochemical data suggest that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct as compared to the equatorialface bisadduct.







Abstract
The multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C59N has been scarcely explored, and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral equatorialface bisadduct of C59N, we focused on the isolation of the first trans&#8208;4 bisadduct in a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the trans&#8208;4 bisadduct of C59N by using cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as a tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has C1 symmetry, as evidenced by 13C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; C59N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.

&lt;p&gt;The multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C&lt;sub&gt;59&lt;/sub&gt;N has been scarcely explored, and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral &lt;i&gt;equatorial&lt;sub&gt;face&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bisadduct of C&lt;sub&gt;59&lt;/sub&gt;N, we focused on the isolation of the first &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;4 bisadduct in a simple two-step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;4 bisadduct of C&lt;sub&gt;59&lt;/sub&gt;N by using &lt;i&gt;cyclo-&lt;/i&gt;[2]-dodecylmalonate as a tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, as evidenced by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, while X-ray crystallography validated the &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;4&#8242; addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;4&#8242; C&lt;sub&gt;59&lt;/sub&gt;N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror-image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV-Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light-harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ternary Hybrid Perovskite Solid Solution Single Crystals: Growth, Composition Determination and Phase Stability in Highly Moist Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13765-13773, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;centimeter&#8208;sized ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals have been grown. Wavelength disperse X&#8208;ray fluorescence is used as a quantitative elemental analysis method. The crystals with optimized composition show superior phase stability when they are stored in high&#8208;humidity environment for over two weeks, while those Cs&#8208;richer or Cs&#8208;poorer samples undergo various degrees of phase segregation induced by moisture.







Abstract
Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solutions have shown superior optoelectronic properties and better stability than their ABX3 simple perovskite counterparts under ambient conditions. However, crystal growth and identification of the accurate composition of these complex crystalline compounds remain challenging, and their stability under extreme conditions such as in highly moist atmosphere is unknown. Herein, large&#8208;size (up to 2&#8197;cm) single crystals of ternary perovskite 0.80FAPbI3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8242;FAPbBr3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;y&#8242;CsPbI3 (x&#8242;+y&#8242;=0.20) are grown. An elemental analysis method based on wavelength dispersive X&#8208;ray fluorescence is proposed to determine their accurate compositions. Among these single crystals, the composition with y&#8242;=0.12 shows the best moisture stability at 90&#8201;% relative humidity for 15&#8197;days. Other components with richer or poorer Cs+ ions undergo different phase segregation behaviours. The performance and stability of photodetectors based on these single crystals are tested. This work offers a deeper insight into phase stability of ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution crystals in highly moist atmosphere.

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13887-13893, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D on&#8208;surface assembly of isosteric phenazine derivatives was investigated by utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy on single&#8208;crystal gold, silver and copper surfaces. The strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerism were found to have a profound impact on the 2D assembly patterns, as evidenced by the variations in surface structure for the three derivative molecules used in this study.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives, DHP, DAP, and DBQD, to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While DHP exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies, DAP and DBQD show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.

         <title>Structure and Functional Differences of Cysteine and 3&#8208;Mercaptopropionate Dioxygenases: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13793-13806, October 1, 2021. </description>

Spheres of influence: Although cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase bind and react similar substrates, there are key differences in the first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination spheres that affect their catalytic reaction mechanism and reactivity, as highlighted by density functional theory studies on large enzyme clusters.







Abstract
Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health; they are involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine. As such, these enzymes have relevance to the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large, active&#8208;site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo&#8208;bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes in substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.

Breaking &#8216;hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill&#8217; bone cancer cells with gallium: Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) are linked to the poor prognosis of metastasised osteosarcoma. Here a gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complex is reported, containing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, diflunisal, capable of killing OSCs more effectively than frontline and secondary anti&#8208;osteosarcoma drugs. The complex evokes cell death by inhibiting cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series, 6 (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably, 6 exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that 6 downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore, 6 induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, 6 is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;Phase Structure</title>

         <dc:description>
Native mass spectrometry is now widely used in protein structural studies. We present a methodology for probing the importance of specific residues in the stabilization of compact protein structure in the gas&#8208;phase using a combination of chemical modification and collision induced unfolding ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.

         <title>Study of the Lithium Storage Mechanism of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Modified Cu2S Electrodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Ad LIB: In this study, thermal carbon reduction of CuS into Cu2S was monitored by high&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD). As LIB electrode material, Li+ storage intermediate Cu1.8S is confirmed by operando methods. The result shows that some original Cu2S remains unreacted after the first cycle, and carbon modification can improve the cycling stability of Cu2S for LIBs in the long&#8208;term cycle.







Abstract
Owing to their high specific capacity and abundant reserve, CuxS compounds are promising electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Carbon compositing could stabilize the CuxS structure and repress capacity fading during the electrochemical cycling, but the corresponding Li+ storage mechanism and stabilization effect should be further clarified. In this study, nanoscale Cu2S was synthesized by CuS co&#8208;precipitation and thermal reduction with polyelectrolytes. High&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction was used to monitor the thermal reduction process. During the first cycle, the conversion mechanism upon lithium storage in the Cu2S/carbon was elucidated by operando synchrotron radiation diffraction and in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;composited Cu2S (Cu2S/C) exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 425&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher, long&#8208;term capacity of 523&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles; in contrast, the bare CuS electrode exhibits 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. Multiple&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry proves that extra Li+ storage can mainly be ascribed to the contribution of the capacitive storage.

On a high: A series of phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;based fluorescent donor&#8211;acceptor molecules were designed and synthesized. They exhibited emissions ranging from green to red with high photoluminescence quantum yield in the solid state. These molecules also showed highly efficient electroluminescence at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application of any kind of light&#8208;emitting diode (LED). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP&#8208;, PIBzPCN&#8208;, and PIBzTPA&#8208;based devices showed EQEs of 8.27, 9.15, and 8.64&#8201;%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond</title>

Halogen bond&#8208;stabilized halonium ions are mild halenium transfer agents. The dependence of their reactivity on chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction has been evaluated using NMR, DFT and kinetics experiments. The mechanistic analysis of the transfer is expected to provide a handle in the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.







Abstract
[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]+ complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their 15N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.

An attractive precursor 3&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) with coplanar bicyclic backbone was synthesized. Two nitrated products of 5 were prepared, and a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich energetic salts were obtained and systematically characterized. These 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials exhibited high combined nitrogen and oxygen content and outstanding enthalpies of formation along with good detonation performance and an acceptable safety profile. Among them, N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide and its dihydroxylammonium salt were screened as the most balanced energetic materials.







Abstract
Combining different nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine&#8208;tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Here, 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4&#8208;triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3&#8208;(5&#8208;Amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) was designed and synthesized. Nitramino&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (6) and N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (7) were also obtained, and two series of corresponding nitrogen&#8208;rich salts were prepared, leading to the creation of new energetic compounds. All derivatives were fully characterized, and five of them were further confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials were studied. Compound 7 and its dihydroxylammonium salt (7&#8201;c) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to that of RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>

Right Bipyramids. By separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow system, Pt right bipyramids containing one single twin plane were obtained in high yield.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br&#8722; ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.

Our role models and mentors are very important in our personal and professional development. However, in most cases, we do not spend enough time or pay enough attention choosing them. Herein, I explain how to select our role models and mentors, what characteristics they should have, and how to get the most out of them. Finally, I comment on the advantages of volunteering in an international scientific organization where you will find people with similar interests with whom to grow with purpose.







Abstract
Choosing the right mentors and role models has a profound impact in both our lives and professional careers; however, most often, not enough time or thought is given to this important decision. Because of that, we may miss some great opportunities and limit the potential benefits. In this invited contribution, I share my personal experience on nurturing the relationship with mentors and on choosing role models with my same values and a strong sense of service.

Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks: This review represents the progress made on the design principles and synthetic strategies for the construction of COFs and their composites for various energy applications such as different types of metal&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs), supercapacitors, water splitting (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER and oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and solar cells. Attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications. An understanding is developed of various strategies to tailor their performance towards desired applications, which will shed light on some possible modification aspects of COF structures with various conducting additives to greatly boost their properties. For more information, see the Review by S.M. Mobin et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;13669.

A three&#8208;center halogen bond modulates the reactivity of a halonium ion and is thereby applicable for controlling the halogenation of alkenes. Chelation, strain, steric hindrance, and electrostatic interactions influence the halonium release rate. Combined experimental and theoretical analysis of the reaction mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and is expected to provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I. P&#225;pai, N. Bowling, M. Erdelyi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102575).

Mg&#8208;doped SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles and various plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids are used to make ecoresorbable electrorheological fluids. The particles are arranged perpendicular to the electrodes to form rigid fibril structures. The type of oil affects the wettability, resulting in differences in electrorheological performance and sedimentation behavior. The biocompatible smart fluids provide better commercial potential with diminishing concerns of environmental issues. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;Lee et&#8197;al.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13659-13659, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand&#8208;exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket was probed by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. These results are particularly relevant in the context of understanding the kinetic lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Bartik, O. Reinaud et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.20102184).

The understanding of multiple polymorphic phase transitions in molecular crystals is still in its infancy. With this in mind, single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were targeted at a polyhedral oxo cluster featuring phenyl rings in the outer sphere. Pressure evolution leads to a gradual relaxation of induced structural strains through stepwise conformational twisting of the phenyl rings with the reorganization of cooperative noncovalent interactions; this propagates the conformational isomerization. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak, J.&#8197;Lewi&#324;ski et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101732).

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>

Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) outline a resourceful illustration by uniting the remarkable properties of materials such as structural and chemical modulation, porosity and crystallinity, which can be productive for different types of metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting (Hydrogen evolution reaction, HER and Oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and solar cells.







Abstract
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of the crystalline porous materials family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.

         <title>Bifunctional Fluorophosphonium Triflates as Intramolecular Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Reversible CO2 Sequestration and Binding of Carbonyls, Nitriles and Acetylenes</title>

Extending the FLP library: Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl or imidazolyl substituents act as intramolecular N/P frustrated Lewis pairs that are capable of small molecule activation, that is, reversible CO2 sequestration and binding of carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes.







Abstract
Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl (3[OTf]) or imidazolyl (4[OTf])&#8208;substituents act as intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) and reversibly form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts with CO2 (5+ and 6+). An unusual and labile spirocyclic tetrahedral intermediate (72+) is observed in CO2&#8208;pressurized (0.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;bar) solutions of cation 4+ at low temperatures, as demonstrated by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies, which were confirmed crystallographically. In addition, cations 3+ and 4+ actively bind carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, as shown by selected examples.

Making a transfer: An iron&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic, biomimetic oxidation of various N&#8208;heterocycles by using the bifunctional hybrid catalyst Co(Salophen)&#8208;HQ as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) is reported. The reaction provides various important aromatic heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The dehydrogenation involves several electron&#8208;transfer steps that are inspired by biological oxidation processes in which molecular oxygen (O2) is used as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Herein, an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic oxidation of N&#8208;heterocycles under aerobic conditions is described. The dehydrogenation process, involving several electron&#8208;transfer steps, is inspired by oxidations occurring in the respiratory chain. An environmentally friendly and inexpensive iron catalyst together with a hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base hybrid catalyst as electron&#8208;transfer mediator were used for the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation reaction of various N&#8208;heterocycles. The method shows a broad substrate scope and delivers important heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.

         <title>Hexaphenylditetrels &#8211; When Longer Bonds Provide Higher Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13699-13702, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;Carbon bonds are exceptional as demonstrated for the hexaphenylditetrels where attractive London dispersion interactions are the decisive factor for the thermodynamic stabilities of tetrels other than carbon. Structural and energetic comparisons show that even though hexaphenylethane displays the largest dispersion energy between the two molecular halves, it has remained elusive because of even larger Pauli repulsion of the phenyl moieties that are forced in close contact due to the C&#8722;C bond that is the shortest in this series.







Abstract
We present a computational analysis of hexaphenylethane derivatives with heavier tetrels comprising the central bond. In stark contrast to parent hexaphenylethane, the heavier tetrel derivatives can readily be prepared. In order to determine the origin of their apparent thermodynamic stability against dissociation as compared to the carbon case, we employed local energy decomposition analysis (LED) and symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVP and sSAPT0/def2&#8208;TZVP levels of theory. We identified London dispersion (LD) interactions as the decisive factor for the molecular stability of heavier tetrel derivatives. This stability is made possible owing to the longer (than C&#8722;C) central bonds that move the phenyl groups out of the heavily repulsive regime so they can optimally benefit from LD interactions.

Smart(phone) recognition: A new fluorescent sensor able to interact noncovalently with DMMP, a CWA simulant, has been synthetized and tested both in solution and in the gas phase. The detection limit in solution is much lower than the toxicity values of CWAs; in the gas phase sensing can be performed on a simple smartphone. With acid/base treatment, the solid device can be reused. This prototype paves the way for the smart detection of nerve agents.







Abstract
The supramolecular detection by image analysis of a simulant chemical warfare agent on a solid device containing a selective molecular sensor based on a BODIPY scaffold is reported. The recognition properties were investigated in solution, demonstrating high affinity (log&#8201;K&#8197;6.60) and sensitivity (LOD 10&#8197;ppt). A test strip also confirmed the sensing properties in gas phase. Image analysis of the solid device allows quantitative information about the simulant to be obtained, recovering the sensor almost 5&#8197;times and thus confirming the goal of the supramolecular approach.

         <title>A Water Soluble Pd2L4 Cage for Selective Binding of Neu5Ac</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13719-13724, October 1, 2021. </description>

The carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that the cage binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied.







Abstract
The sialic acid N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its derivatives are involved in many biological processes including cell&#8208;cell recognition and infection by influenza. Molecules that can recognize Neu5Ac might thus be exploited to intervene in or monitor such events. A key obstacle in this development is the sparse availability of easily prepared molecules that bind to this carbohydrate in its natural solvent; water. Here, we report that the carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage 7. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that 7 binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied. Aided by molecular modeling, the selectivity for anionic carbohydrates such as Neu5Ac could be rationalized by the presence of charge assisted hydrogen bonds and/or the presence of a salt bridge with a guanidinium solubilizing arm of 7. Establishing that a simple coordination cage such as 7 can already selectively bind to Neu5Ac in water paves the way to improve the stability, affinity and/or selectivity properties of M2L4 cages for carbohydrates and other small molecules.

         <title>Diazophosphonates: Effective Surrogates for Diazoalkanes in Pyrazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13703-13708, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starring in a triple role&#8230; Diazophosphonates are excellent 1,3&#8208;dipoles in both inter&#8208; and intramolecular cycloadditions with alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles. The phosphoryl group has three key roles: its electron&#8208;withdrawing nature stabilizes the diazo compound, its unexploited propensity to migrate readily in sigmatropic rearrangements facilitates its transfer from C to N in the initial cycloadduct, and hence it is easily removed from the final pyrazole product.







Abstract
Diazophosphonates, readily prepared from &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates by oxidation of the corresponding hydrazones in batch or in flow, are useful partners in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles, including the first intramolecular examples of such a process. The phosphoryl group imbues a number of desirable properties into the diazo 1,3&#8208;dipole. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the phosphoryl stabilizes the diazo compound making it easier to handle, whilst the ability of the phosphoryl group to migrate readily in a [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enables its transfer from C to N to aromatize the initial cycloadduct, and hence its facile removal from the final pyrazole product. Overall, the diazophosphonate acts as a surrogate for the much less stable diazoalkane in cycloadditions, with the phosphoryl group playing a vital, but traceless, role. The cycloaddition proceeds more readily with alkynes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, and is regiospecific with asymmetrical alkynes. The potential of diazophosphonates for use in bioorthogonal cycloadditions is demonstrated by their facile addition to strained alkynes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starring in a triple role&#8230;&lt;/b&gt; Diazophosphonates are excellent 1,3-dipoles in both inter- and intramolecular cycloadditions with alkynes to give &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-H pyrazoles. The phosphoryl group has three key roles: its electron-withdrawing nature stabilizes the diazo compound, its unexploited propensity to migrate readily in sigmatropic rearrangements facilitates its transfer from C to N in the initial cycloadduct, and hence it is easily removed from the final pyrazole product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diazophosphonates, readily prepared from &#945;-ketophosphonates by oxidation of the corresponding hydrazones in batch or in flow, are useful partners in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions to alkynes to give &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-H pyrazoles, including the first intramolecular examples of such a process. The phosphoryl group imbues a number of desirable properties into the diazo 1,3-dipole. The electron-withdrawing nature of the phosphoryl stabilizes the diazo compound making it easier to handle, whilst the ability of the phosphoryl group to migrate readily in a [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement enables its transfer from C to N to aromatize the initial cycloadduct, and hence its facile removal from the final pyrazole product. Overall, the diazophosphonate acts as a surrogate for the much less stable diazoalkane in cycloadditions, with the phosphoryl group playing a vital, but traceless, role. The cycloaddition proceeds more readily with alkynes bearing electron-withdrawing groups, and is regiospecific with asymmetrical alkynes. The potential of diazophosphonates for use in bioorthogonal cycloadditions is demonstrated by their facile addition to strained alkynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the basis of cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene ( CTX ), a novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based CTX derivative ( WPCTX ) was prepared with facile synthetic procedure and satisfying yield. Several model guest molecules were selected to investigate WPCTX 's host&#8208;guest properties. Based on the study of the host and model guest complexation, a tetraphenylethylene derivative from model guest was employed as a guest molecule ( G ) to form WPCTX &#8835; G nanoparticles (NPs) with WPCTX through further supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in water. Moreover, the hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Eosin Y ( ESY ) or Nile red ( NiR ), was encapsulated in WPCTX &#8835; G NPs, respectively, to construct two types of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems. Their high antenna effect demonstrated such NPs successfully mimicked light&#8208;harvesting system in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox isomerization/(3 + 2) allenoate annulation by auto&#8208;tandem phosphine catalysis.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine catalyzed approach to pyrrolines has been developed that involves two mechanistically unlinked catalytic processes. The first involves the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to provide access to aliphatic tosyl imines, which then engage in a (3 + 2) annulation with various allenoates. The reaction shows generality, with 24 examples established, along with a low yielding and moderately enantioselective variant. Mechanistic studies indicate that the viability of the process is linked to the selection of catalysts with similar propensity to add to the two coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>A Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of higher alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is an important reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals with added value. Though the process for primary alcohol oxidation is industrially established, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding considering the complexity of the catalysts and their dynamics under reaction conditions, especially when higher alcohols and liquid&#8208;phase reaction media are involved. Additionally, new materials should be developed offering higher activity, selectivity, and stability. This can be achieved by unraveling the structure&#8210;performance correlations of these catalysts under reaction conditions. In this regard, researchers are encouraged to develop more advanced characterization techniques to address the complex interplay between the solid surface, the dissolved reactants, and the solvent. In this mini&#8208;review, we report some of the most important approaches taken in the field and give a perspective on how to tackle the complex challenges for different approaches in alcohol oxidation while providing insight into the remaining challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>The Roles of Composition and Mesostructure of Cobalt&#8208;based Spinel Catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the crystalline precursor decomposition approach and direct co&#8208;precipitation the composition and mesostructure of cobalt&#8208;based spinels can be controlled. A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox&#8208;active iron and redox&#8208;inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co  3  O  4  , MgCo  2  O  4  , Co  2  FeO  4  , Co  2  AlO  4  and CoFe  2  O  4  . The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H  2  O  2  decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co  3  O  4  and CoFe  2  O  4  catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogs. For CAN&#8208;test and OER, Co  3+  plays the major role for high activity. In H  2  O  2  decomposition, Co  2+  reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions. A benefit of a predominant 111 surface termination depends on the cobalt oxidation state in the as&#8208;prepared catalysts and the investigated reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The parent borylene (CAAC)(Me3P)BH,  1  (CAAC = cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene), acts both as a Lewis base and one&#8208;electron reducing agent towards group 13 trichlorides (ECl3  , E = B, Al, Ga, In), yielding the adducts  1&#8208;ECl  3  and increasing proportions of the radical cation  [1]  &#8226;+  for the heavier group 13 analogues. With boron trihalides (BX3, X = F, Cl, Br, I)  1  undergoes sequential adduct formation and halide abstraction reactions to yield borylboronium cations and shows an increasing tendency towards redox processes for the heavier halides. Calculations confirm that  1  acts as a strong Lewis base towards EX3  and show a marked increase in the B&#8211;E bond dissociation energies down both group 13 and the halide group.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Control of Perylene Supramolecular Polymers through Imide Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number and type of new supramolecular polymer (SMP) systems have increased rapidly in recent years. Some of the key challenges faced for these novel systems include gaining full control over the mode of self&#8208;assembly, the creation of novel architectures and exploring functionality. Here we provide a critical overview of approaches related to perylene&#8208;based SMPs and discuss progress to exert control over these potentially important SMPs through chemical modification of the imide substituents. Imide substitutions affect self&#8208;assembly behaviour orthogonally to the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of the perylene core, making for a valuable approach to tune SMP properties. Several recent approaches are therefore highlighted, with a focus on controlling 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208; aggregation, and 3) mechanism of growth and degree of aggregation using thermodynamic and kinetic control. Areas of potential future exploration and application of these functional SMPs are also explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid, highly reactive and stable DOTA&#8208;like tags containing a thiol&#8208;specific phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety for protein modification and NMR analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site specific labeling of paramagnetic NMR tags generate valuable structural restraints such as pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) that can be used to characterize structures, interactions and dynamics of protein&#8208;ligand or nucleic acid complexes. Herein, two single&#8208;armed DOTA&#8208;like tags, BrPSPy&#8208;DO3M(  S  )A&#8208;Ln and BrPSPy&#8208;6M&#8208;DO3M(  S  )A&#8208;Ln, each containing a thiol&#8208;specific reacting group, phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety, are demonstrated as rigid, reactive and stable paramagnetic tags for protein labeling by formation of a reductive resistant thiol&#8208;ether bond between the protein and the tag. The introduction of Br neighboring the 4&#8208;phenylsulfone group in pyridine enhances the reactivity towards the solvent exposed thiol group in a protein, whereas the methyl group in the sixth position in pyridine increases the rigidity of the tag in the protein conjugates. The high performance and tunable reactivity and rigidity of these two tags can be added in the toolbox of paramagnetic tags suitable for the high&#8208;resolution measurements of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton Coupling in Redox&#8208;Active Salen based Self&#8208;Assembled Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of a redox&#8208;active nickel salen complex into supramolecular structures was explored via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with homobimetallic ruthenium complexes (bridged by oxalato or 5,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinato ligands). The self&#8208;assembly resulted in the formation of a discrete rectangle using the oxalato complex and either a rectangle or a catenane employing the larger naphthoquinonato complex. The formation of the interlocked self&#8208;assembly was determined to be solvent and concentration dependent. The electronic structure and stability of the oxidized metallacycles was probed using electrochemical experiments, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, confirming ligand radical formation. Exciton coupling of the intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) ligand radical intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) bands provided further confirmation of the geometric and electronic structures in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Surface Curvature in Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive consumption of fossil fuels has caused unavoidable environmental problems. The development of renewable and clean alternatives is essential for the sustainable and green development of human society. Electrocatalysts are most important parts in these energy&#8208;related devices. Recently, scientists found that the surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for the improvement of catalytic performance and the optimization of intrinsic catalytic activity during electrocatalytic process. The role of surface curvature in electrocatalysts is still under investigating. In this minireview, we summarized the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy&#8208;related applications. This review mainly involves the strategies for preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, three typical electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures (curled surface, onion&#8208;like structure, and spiral structure), and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of imine bond is reversible. This feature has been taken advantage of by chemists for accomplishing high yielding self&#8208;assembly. On the other hand, it also jeopardizes the intrinsic stability of these self&#8208;assembled products. However, some recent discoveries demonstrate that some of these imine bond containing molecules could be rather stable or kinetically inert. A deep investigation indicated that such enhanced stability results from, at least partially, multivalence. Such results also inspire chemists to use imine condensation for self&#8208;assembly in water, a solvent that is considered not compatible with imine bond for a long time.</dc:description>

         <title>Presodiation Strategies for the Promotion of Sodium&#8208;Based Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years lots of progress has been made in the field of presodiation, herein we provide a schematic overview of presodiation in Na&#8208;based energy storage systems, illustrating various strategies to compensate for irreversible sodium loss as well as other functions.







Abstract
Nowadays sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems (Na&#8208;based ESSs) have been widely researched as it possesses the possibility to replace traditional energy storage media to become next generation energy storage system. However, due to the irreversible loss of sodium ions in the first cycle, development of Na&#8208;based ESSs is limited. Presodiation, as a strategy of adding excess sodium ions to the system in advance, accomplishes the enhancement of electrochemical performance. In this minireview, different presodiation strategies applied in sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems will be summarized in detail, their functions and corresponding mechanisms will be discussed as well. Furthermore, the current novel application of presodiation method in other aspects of Na&#8208;based ESSs will be mentioned additionally. At last, in the view of present research status of presodiation, issues that can be mitigated are put forward and guidelines are given on how to deliberate in&#8208;depth presodiation technology in the future, dedicating to promote the further development of Na&#8208;based ESSs.

         <title>Reductive Aldol&#8208;type Reactions in the Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmaceutically important substances which were synthesized via aldol&#8208;type reactions were analyzed. The side reactions, advantages, and challenges in these syntheses are described in this review.







Abstract
The efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of saturated carbon&#8208;carbon fragment is the critical challenge of organic synthesis; therefore, developing new methods for formation of these bonds is paramount. The rising interest for reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions is conditioned by its versatile applications, allowing the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The review aims to highlight the advantages and disadvantage of reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions to total synthesis of pharmaceutical substances in order to summarize knowledge and encourage further investigation of the field.

         <title>Primary Sulfonamide Functionalization via Sulfonyl Pyrroles: Seeing the N&#8722;Ts Bond in a Different Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonamides are prevalent in drug molecules, however, methods for functionalizing sulfonamides via S&#8722;N bond cleavage are scarce. Based on a re&#8208;evaluation of N&#8722;Ts deprotection, we developed sulfonyl pyrroles as linchpins for sulfonamide functionalization. Sulfonyl pyrroles engage in various transformations that can proceed through chemical, electrochemical or photochemical pathways.







Abstract
Despite common occurrence in molecules of value, methods for transforming sulfonamides are distinctly lacking. Here we introduce easy&#8208;to&#8208;access sulfonyl pyrroles as synthetic linchpins for sulfonamide functionalization. The versatility of the sulfonyl pyrrole unit is shown by generating a variety of products through chemical, electrochemical and photochemical pathways. Preliminary results on the direct functionalization of primary sulfonamides are also provided, which may lead to new modes of activation.

         <title>Engineered Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrion is a promising target in cancer therapy. However, gaining access to this organelle is difficult due to the obstacles to cross the complicated mitochondrial membrane. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides with mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability are efficient tools to deliver exogenous therapeutics into mitochondria. A new type of mitochondrion&#8208;targeting peptides (MTPs) with facile preparation, good biocompatibility, and convenient functionalization for mitochondrion&#8208;targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy is reported.







Abstract
Mitochondrion is a promising target in cancer therapy. However, gaining access to this organelle is difficult due to the obstacles to cross the complicated mitochondrial membrane. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability, named mitochondrion&#8208;targeting peptides (MTPs), are efficient tools to deliver exogenous therapeutics into mitochondria. Herein, we report several new MTPs, which can be readily synthesized via resin&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. In particular, MTP3 (compound 5), consisting of three positively charged arginines and two D&#8208; and L&#8208; alternating naphthylalanines, demonstrated excellent mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability with high Pearson's correlation coefficient, suggesting that MTP3 has good potential for mitochondrion&#8208;targeted drug delivery. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the feasibility of MTP3 was validated by the preparation of a mitochondrion&#8208;targeting prodrug (compound 17, doxorubicin&#8208;based prodrug). This prodrug was subsequently confirmed to be specifically transported to the mitochondria of tumor cells, where it was able to release the native doxorubicin upon intracellular GSH activation, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and eventually cell death. Importantly, compound 17 showed good cytotoxicity against human tumor cells while negligible toxicity towards normal cells, indicating its potential as a potent mitochondrial medicine for targeted cancer therapy. Our study thus opens a way for engineered CPPs to be used to deliver bioactive cargos in mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochemiluminescence from Au18 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highest ECL quantum efficiency: Near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (NIR&#8211;ECL) of Au18(SC6H11)140 nanoclusters was explicitly explored; it reveals the highest ever quantum efficiency of 5.5 relative to that of standard Ru(bpy)32+ for the Au nanocluster family. ECL peak wavelengths of 832 and 848&#8197;nm were assigned unambiguously to the emission from Au180*, Au181+* and Au182+* in terms of spooling ECL and photoluminescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Bright, near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (NIR&#8211;ECL) of Au18 nanoclusters is reported herein. Spooling ECL and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to track and link NIR emissions at 832 and 848&#8197;nm to three emissive species, Au180*, Au181+* and Au182+*, with a considerably high ECL efficiency of 5.5 relative to that of the gold standard Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA (with 5&#8211;6&#8201;% reported ECL efficiency). The unprecedentedly high efficiency is due to the overlapped oxidation potentials of Au180 and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine as co&#8208;reactant, the exposed facets of Au180 gold core, and electrocatalytic loops. These discoveries will add a new member to the efficient NIR&#8208;ECL gold nanoclusters family and bring more potential applications.

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Modified Serinol Nucleic Acid Nanostructure Converts the Chirality of Threoninol Nucleic Acids into Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passing on information: A circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) probe that turns on a CPL signal upon hybridization has been developed. Pyrene was attached to serinol nucleic acid (SNA) to form an achiral nanowire. The SNA nanowire can convert the chiral information of nucleic acids into CD and CPL signals. The nanostructure would work as a versatile platform to detect chiral biomolecules in aqueous solution.







Abstract
Herein is reported a circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) probe that can respond to the chirality of nucleic acids. An achiral nanostructure was prepared by the hybridization of symmetric serinol nucleic acid (SNA) containing pyrene&#8208;modified residues. When chiral oligomers that were complementary to the SNA were added, they induced helicity into the SNA nanowire. Efficient circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification was observed when pyrene was attached to uracil bases through a rigid alkynyl linker. Both CPL and CD signals were observed; they depended on the chirality of the added acyclic threoninol nucleic acid (aTNA) oligomer. This system can be used to convert the chirality of chiral biomolecules into chiroptical signals.

         <title>Triaminocyclopentadienyl Ruthenium Complexes &#8211; New Catalysts for Cascade Conversions of Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes are useful catalysts for cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols with CH&#8208;acidic nucleophiles. Their catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.







Abstract
Various triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes have been synthesized from Ru3(CO)12. The new complexes were tested for their ability to catalyze cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols. Their associated catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. In particular, the substrate scope of catalytic cycloadditions with 3&#8208;ketolactones or phloroglucinol derivatives is extended to terpenoid&#8208;derived propargyl alcohols containing an internal alkyne moiety. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.

         <title>Harvesting Light To Produce Heat: Photothermal Nanoparticles for Technological Applications and Biomedical Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermal effect is the ability to transform absorbed electromagnetic radiation into heat. Although it was first studied in nonspherical Au nanoparticles with NIR localized surface plasmon resonance absorptions for through&#8208;tissues hyperthermal tumor ablation, for more than 20&#8197;years this effect has been recognized in nanoparticles of different materials and shapes, and used for a wide spectrum of biomedical and technical applications, which are reviewed here.







Abstract
The photothermal properties of nanoparticles (NPs), that is, their ability to convert absorbed light into heat, have been studied since the end of the last century, mainly on gold NPs. In the new millennium, these studies have developed into a burst of research dedicated to the photothermal ablation of tumors. However, beside this strictly medical theme, research has also flourished in the connected areas of photothermal antibacterial surface coatings, gels and polymers, of photothermal surfaces for cell stimulation, as well as in purely technological areas that do not involve medical biotechnology. These include the direct conversion of solar light into heat, a more efficient sun&#8208;powered generation of steam and the use of inkjet&#8208;printed patterns of photothermal NPs for anticounterfeit printing based on temperature reading, to cite but a few. After an analysis of the photothermal effect (PTE) and its mechanism, this minireview briefly considers the antitumor&#8208;therapy theme and takes an in&#8208;depth look at all the other technological and biomedical applications of the PTE, paying particular attention to photothermal materials whose NPs have joined those based on Au.

         <title>Salicylideneaniline is a Photoswitchable Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylideneaniline has been discovered to be an organic photoswitchable ferroelectric crystal with a type of photo&#8208;induced enol&#8722;keto structural isomerization accompanied by evident photochromism, which is different from the thermodynamic order&#8208;disorder or displacive one. The microscopic ferroelectric polarization can be quickly and reversibly switched upon UV light irradiation, holding great promise for developing optical control of smart devices in the future.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the first ferroelectric Rochelle salt, most ferroelectrics have been investigated showing thermally triggered symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition. Although photochromism arising from geometrical isomerization was reported as early as 1867, such photoswitchable ferroelectric crystals have scarcely been developed to date. Herein, we report that salicylideneaniline is a photochromic ferroelectric crystal. Upon photoirradiation, the dielectric constant shows obvious switching between high and low dielectric states, and more importantly, the ferroelectric polarization demonstrates quick and reversible switching. This work opens the gate to developing photoswitchable ferroelectrics, which holds great potential for applications in optically controlled smart devices.

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silica gardens are self&#8208;assembled tubular precipitates formed by a combination of osmosis, buoyancy, and chemical reaction, and thought to be capable of catalyzing prebiotic condensation reactions. In many cases, the tube wall is a bilayer structure with the properties of a diaphragm and/or a membrane. The interest of silica gardens in materials science as microreactors has increased over the past decade because of their ability to create long&#8208;lasting electrochemical potential. In this study, we have grown single macroscopic tubes based on calcium carbonate and monitored their time&#8208;dependent behavior by in&#8208;situ measurements of pH, ionic concentrations inside and outside the tubular membranes, and electrochemical potential differences. Further, we have characterized the composition and structure of the tubular membranes by using ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Based on the collected data, we propose a physicochemical mechanism for the formation and ripening of these peculiar CaCO  3  structures and compare the results to those of other chemical garden systems. We find that the wall of the macroscopic calcium carbonate tubes is a bilayer of texturally distinct but compositionally similar calcite showing high crystallinity. The resulting high density of the material prevents macroscopic calcium carbonate gardens to develop significant electrochemical potential differences. In the light of these observations, possible implications in materials science and prebiotic (geo)chemistry are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonheme Iron Imido Complexes Bearing a Non&#8208;Innocent Ligand: A Synthetic Chameleon Species in Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;imido complexes can perform C&#8211;H activation and sulfimidation reactions, but are far less studied than the more ubiquitous iron&#8208;oxo species. As case studies, we have looked at a recently published iron(V)&#8208;imido ligand &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex, which is formally an iron(VI)&#8208;imido complex [Fe  V  (NTs)(TAML  +&#183;  )] (  1  ; NTs = tosylimido), and an iron(V)&#8208;imido complex [Fe  V  (NTs)(TAML)]  &#8208;  (  2  ). Using a theoretical approach, we found that they have multiple energetically close&#8208;lying electromers, sometimes even without changing spin states, reminiscent of the so&#8208;called Compound I in Cytochrome P450. When studying their reactivity theoretically, it is indeed found that their electronic structures may change to perform efficient oxidations, emulating the multi&#8208;spin state reactivity in Fe  IV  O systems. This is actually in contrast to the known [Fe  V  (O)(TAML)]  &#8208;  species (  3  ), where the reactions occur only on the ground spin state. We also looked into the whole reaction pathway for the C&#8211;H bond activation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene by these intermediates to reproduce the experimentally observed products, including steps that usually attract no interest (neither theoretically nor experimentally) due to their non&#8208;rate&#8208;limiting status and fast reactivity. A new &#8220;clustering non&#8208;rebound mechanism&#8221; is presented for this C&#8211;H activation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy and High Efficiency Light&#8208;driven Hydrogen Evolution of a {Mo3S4}&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Polyoxothiometalate ions (ThioPOM) are active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts based on modular assembly build from electrophilic clusters {MoS  x  } and vacant polyoxotungstates. Herein, the dumbbell&#8208;like anion [{(PW  11  O  39  )Mo  3  S  4  (H  2  O)  3  (OH)}  2  ]  8&#8208;  exhibits very high light&#8208;driven HER activity while the active cores {Mo  3  S  4  } do not contain any exposed disulfido ligands which were suspected at the origin of the HER activity. Moreover, in the catalyst architecture, the two central {Mo  3  S  4  } cores are sandwiched by two {PW  11  O  39  }  7&#8208;  subunits that act as oxidant resistant protecting groups and behave as electron&#8208;collecting units. A detailed photophysical study was carried out confirming the reductive quenching mechanism of the photosensitizer [Ir(ppy)  2  (dtbbpy)]  +  by the sacrificial donor triethanolamine (TEOA) and highlighting the very high rate constant of the electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the ThioPOM catalyst. Such results provide new insights in the field of molecular catalytic systems able to promote high HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Radical Desaturation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site&#8208;selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N&#8208;radical generates a translocated C&#8208;radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag&#8208;couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Cyclohexene Oxidation with O2 over Spray&#8208;Flame&#8208;Synthesized La1&#8208;xSrxCoO3 Perovskite Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>La  1&#8208;x  Sr  x  CoO  3  (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8209;flame synthesis and applied in liquid&#8209;phase oxidation of cyclohexene using molecular O  2  as oxidant under mild conditions. The catalysts were systematically characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques. With increasing Sr content, the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects increases, which is beneficial for cyclohexene oxidation, but the surface concentration of less active Co  2+  was also increased. However, Co  2+  cations have a superior activity towards peroxide decomposition, which also plays an important role in cyclohexene oxidation. A Sr&#8209;doping of 20&#160;at.% was found to be the optimum in terms of activity and product selectivity. It also showed excellent reusability over three catalytic runs, which can be attributed to its highly stable particle size and morphology. Kinetic investigations revealed first&#8209;order reaction kinetics for temperatures between 60 and 100&#160;&#176;C and an apparent activation energy of 68&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8208;1  for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the reaction was not affected by the applied O  2  pressure in the range from 10 to 20 bar.  In situ  attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion of cyclohexene and the formation of reaction products including the key intermediate 2&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;hydroperoxide, while spin trap electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided strong evidence for a radical reaction pathway by identifying the cyclohexenyl alkoxyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Segregated Protein&#8211;Cucurbit[7]uril Crystalline Architectures via Modulatory Peptide Tectons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;supramolecular tectonics. The bionanoarchitectures of a &#946;&#8208;propeller protein and cucurbit[7]uril (Q7) were customized by incorporating peptide tectons. Segregated crystalline assemblies with alternating rigid and flexible layers were obtained. The flexible spacer layer could be achieved with either structured (coiled&#8208;coil) or disordered (mussel foot peptide) tectons fused to the &#946;&#8208;propeller protein. A protein&#8211;Q7 cage&#8208;like architecture partially captured a disordered nucleoporin peptide.







Abstract
One approach to protein assembly involves water&#8208;soluble supramolecular receptors that act like glues. Bionanoarchitectures directed by these scaffolds are often system&#8208;specific, with few studies investigating their customization. Herein, the modulation of cucurbituril&#8208;mediated protein assemblies through the inclusion of peptide tectons is described. Three peptides of varying length and structural order were N&#8208;terminally appended to RSL, a &#946;&#8208;propeller building block. Each fusion protein was incorporated into crystalline architectures mediated by cucurbit[7]uril (Q7). A trimeric coiled&#8208;coil served as a spacer within a Q7&#8208;directed sheet assembly of RSL, giving rise to a layered material of varying porosity. Within the spacer layers, the coiled&#8208;coils were dynamic. This result prompted consideration of intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs) as modulatory tectons. Similar to the coiled&#8208;coil, a mussel adhesion peptide (Mefp) also acted as a spacer between protein&#8211;Q7 sheets. In contrast, the fusion of a nucleoporin peptide (Nup) to RSL did not recapitulate the sheet assembly. Instead, a Q7&#8208;directed cage was adopted, within which disordered Nup peptides were partially &#8220;captured&#8221; by Q7 receptors. IDP capture occurred by macrocycle recognition of an intrapeptide Phe&#8208;Gly motif in which the benzyl group was encapsulated by Q7. The modularity of these protein&#8211;cucurbituril architectures adds a new dimension to macrocycle&#8208;mediated protein assembly. Segregated protein crystals, with alternating layers of high and low porosity, could provide a basis for new types of materials.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Tryptophan Modification in Oligopeptides Employing Acylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo click chemistry was used for the selective modification of the indole moiety in various tryptophan&#8208;containing di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;peptides. The process uses aroylsilanes as readily available reagents, that cleanly rearrange upon visible light irradiation to the corresponding silyloxycarbenes which in turn insert into the indole N&#8722;H bond to give stable silyl protected hemiaminals.







Abstract
A method for the selective tryptophan modification and labelling of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides is described. Photoirradiation of acylsilanes generates reactive siloxycarbenes which undergo H&#8722;N&#8208;insertion into the indole moiety of tryptophan to give stable silyl protected hemiaminals. This method is successfully applied to chemically modify various tryptophan containing oligopeptides. The method enables the selective introduction of alkynes to peptides that are eligible for further alkyne&#8208;azide click chemistry. In addition, the dansyl fluorophore can be conjugated to a peptide using this approach.

         <title>Dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) Complexes with (CF2)n Chains: Insights into The Role of Aurophilic Interactions in the Au(I) Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aurophilic interactions promote the oxidation of AuI2 compounds to give complexes containing a AuII&#8208;AuII bond instead of AuIII2 or mixed&#8208;valent species. The obtained AuII complexes undergo thermal or photochemical elimination of R3PAuX to give AuIII perfluorinated auracyclic complexes through radical intermediates.







Abstract
New dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) complexes containing (CF2)n bridging chains were obtained. Metallomacrocycles [Au2{&#956;&#8208;(CF2)4}{&#956;&#8208;diphosphine}] show an uncommon figure&#8208;eight structure, the helicity inversion barrier of which is influenced by aurophilic interactions and steric constraints imposed by the diphosphine. Halogenation of LAu(CF2)4AuL (L=PPh3, PMe3, (dppf)1/2, (binap)1/2) gave [Au(II)]2 species, some of which display unprecedented folded structures with Au&#8722;Au bonds. Aurophilic interactions facilitate this oxidation process by preorganizing the starting [Au(I)]2 complexes and lowering its redox potential. The obtained [Au(II)]2 complexes undergo thermal or photochemical elimination of R3PAuX to give Au(III) perfluorinated auracycles. Evidence of a radical mechanism for these decomposition reactions was obtained.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Azo&#8208;Bridged Furoxanylazoles as High&#8208;Performance Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Handle with care: A series of polyazole structures incorporating azo&#8208;bridged heterocyclic backbones was synthesized by simple and efficient chemical routes. Structural features of the newly prepared energetic materials enabled modulation of their functional properties. Due to high densities and exceptionally high enthalpies of formation, these energetic materials showed excellent detonation performance exceeding that of benchmark explosives RDX and PETN.







Abstract
A series of novel energetic materials comprising of azo&#8208;bridged furoxanylazoles enriched with energetic functionalities was designed and synthesized. These high&#8208;energy materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C, 14N) spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular structures of representative amino and azo oxadiazole assemblies were additionally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. A comparison of contributions of explosophoric moieties into the density of energetic materials revealed that furoxan and 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole rings are the densest motifs while the substitution of the azide and amino fragments on the nitro and azo ones leads to an increase of the density. Azo bridged energetic materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (68.8&#8211;76.9&#8201;%) and high thermal stability. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.62&#8211;1.88&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3), very high enthalpies of formation (846&#8211;1720&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.66&#8211;9.09&#8197;km&#8201;s&#8722;1 and detonation pressures 25.0&#8211;37.7&#8197;GPa). From the application perspective, the detonation parameters of azo oxadiazole assemblies exceed those of the benchmark explosive RDX, while a combination of high detonation performance and acceptable friction sensitivity of azo(1,2,4&#8208;triazolylfuroxan) make it a promising potential alternative to PETN.

     alt="Design and Synthesis of Nitrogen-Rich Azo-Bridged Furoxanylazoles as High-Performance Energetic Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handle with care&lt;/b&gt;: A series of polyazole structures incorporating azo-bridged heterocyclic backbones was synthesized by simple and efficient chemical routes. Structural features of the newly prepared energetic materials enabled modulation of their functional properties. Due to high densities and exceptionally high enthalpies of formation, these energetic materials showed excellent detonation performance exceeding that of benchmark explosives RDX and PETN.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of novel energetic materials comprising of azo-bridged furoxanylazoles enriched with energetic functionalities was designed and synthesized. These high-energy materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N) spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular structures of representative amino and azo oxadiazole assemblies were additionally confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and X-ray powder diffraction. A comparison of contributions of explosophoric moieties into the density of energetic materials revealed that furoxan and 1,2,4-oxadiazole rings are the densest motifs while the substitution of the azide and amino fragments on the nitro and azo ones leads to an increase of the density. Azo bridged energetic materials have high nitrogen-oxygen contents (68.8&#8211;76.9&#8201;%) and high thermal stability. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.62&#8211;1.88&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), very high enthalpies of formation (846&#8211;1720&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.66&#8211;9.09&#8197;km&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and detonation pressures 25.0&#8211;37.7&#8197;GPa). From the application perspective, the detonation parameters of azo oxadiazole assemblies exceed those of the benchmark explosive RDX, while a combination of high detonation performance and acceptable friction sensitivity of azo(1,2,4-triazolylfuroxan) make it a promising potential alternative to PETN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using Terpene Synthase Plasticity in Catalysis: On the Enzymatic Conversion of Synthetic Farnesyl Diphosphate Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four synthetic FPP analogues were converted by three robust bacterial sesquiterpene synthases, yielding previously unknown compounds with high stereoselectivity, which demonstrates that this approach can open the doors to chemical terra incognita. The altered or partially blocked reactivity in the substrates also gave interesting insights into the enzyme mechanisms which adds to our understanding of terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Four synthetic farnesyl diphosphate analogues were enzymatically converted with three bacterial sesquiterpene synthases, including &#946;&#8208;himachalene synthase (HcS) and (Z)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;bisabolene synthase (BbS) from Cryptosporangium arvum, and germacrene A synthase (SmTS6) from Streptomyces mobaraensis. These enzyme reactions not only yielded several previously unknown compounds, showing that this approach opened the door to a new chemical space, but substrates with blocked or altered reactivities also gave interesting insights into the cyclisation mechanisms and the potential to catalyse reactions with different initial cyclisation modes.

         <title>Fabrication of ZnSe/C Hollow Polyhedrons for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons are successfully synthesized by selenization of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) coating. The protection of C layer derived from RF coating layer and Ostwald ripening during the process of selenization play important roles in promoting formation of ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons. As lithium ion batteries anode, the ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons exhibit good rate performance and long&#8208;term cycle stability.







Abstract
ZnSe has got extensive attention for high&#8208;performance LIBs anode due to its remarkable theoretical capacity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the large volume variation for the ZnSe in the discharge/charge processes brings about rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance. Herein, ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons are successfully synthesized by selenization of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) coating. The protection of C layer derived from RF coating layer and Ostwald ripening during the process of selenization play important roles in promoting formation of ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons. The ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons exhibit good rate performance and long&#8208;term cycle stability (345&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 up to 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) anode. The improved electrochemical performance is benefit from the unique ZnSe/C hollow structure, in which the hollow structure can effectively avoid terrible volume expansion, and the thin ZnSe/C shell can not only provide adequate diffusion paths of lithium ions and but also enhance the electronic conductivity.

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photodriven Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rich Ti vacancies in TiO2 nanofibers are presented in the Full Paper by X.&#8208;Y. Yang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101817). The unidirectional electron trap and directional H+ adsorption ability of Ti vacancies enable efficient charge transfer and resistance to the corrosion of seawater. They thus contribute excellent activity and long&#8208;time stability to photodriven seawater splitting, opening a door to marine applications of semiconductors.

         <dc:description>The combination of a cobalt&#8208;dioxolene core that exhibits valence tautomerism (VT) with pyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid functionalized with the chains bearing two, four, or six oxyethylene units led to new complexes  Co  n  EGEspy  (  n  = 2, 4, and 6).

         <title>A Benzodiphosphaborolediide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C 6 H 4 P 2 BPh] 2&#8211; ( 1 2&#8208; ), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C 6 H 4 {PH 2 }) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 1 2&#8208; , which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951; 5 &#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO) 3 (&#951; 5 &#8208; 1 )}{&#956;&#8208;&#951; 1 &#8208;Mo(CO) 3 (TMEDA)} 2 ].[Li(THF)][Li(TMEDA)].</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoS  x  hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45 min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. The results indicated that a fused indoline produced by photochemical intramolecular d&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. Since this substrate has an aminal skeleton, racemization involving a ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing equilibrium process occurred under suitable conditions. Efficient racemization was observed in acetone containing a catalytic base, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). Crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization by Viedma ripening from racemic indoline was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99% ee. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of the indoline was achieved by the photochemical reaction of achiral phthalimide followed by continuous attrition&#8208;enhanced deracemization converging to 99% ee of enantiomeric crystals. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by photochemical hydrogen abstraction and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;Selective Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high identity shared among the various Hsp90 isoforms (&gt;85&#8201;%) within the N&#8208;terminal ATP&#8208;binding pocket has made the development of isoform selective inhibitors very challenging. Recently, we reported the first Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitor, which induced the degradation of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;dependent clients without induction of Hsp90 levels. Structure&#8208;activity relationships for the first Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitor are disclosed herein and led to the identification of compound 5, which exhibited &#8764;370&#8208;fold selectivity for Hsp90&#946; over Hsp90&#945;.







Abstract
The 90&#8197;kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90) are molecular chaperones that are responsible for the folding and/or trafficking of &#8764;400 client proteins, many of which are directly associated with cancer progression. Consequently, inhibition of Hsp90 can exhibit similar activity as combination therapy as multiple signaling nodes can be targeted simultaneously. In fact, seventeen small&#8208;molecule inhibitors that bind the Hsp90&#8197;N&#8208;terminus entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, all of which exhibited pan&#8208;inhibitory activity against all four Hsp90 isoforms. Unfortunately, most demonstrated undesired effects alongside induction of the pro&#8208;survival heat shock response. As a result, isoform&#8208;selective inhibitors have been sought to overcome these detriments. Described herein is a structure&#8208;based approach to design Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors along with preliminary SAR. In the end, compound 5 was shown to manifest &#8764;370&#8208;fold selectivity for Hsp90&#946; versus Hsp90&#945;, and induced the degradation of select Hsp90&#946;&#8208;dependent clients. These data support the development of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors as a new paradigm to overcome the detriments associated with pan&#8208;inhibition of Hsp90.

         <title>Covalent Linkage of BODIPY&#8208;Photosensitizers to Anderson&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates Using CLICK Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of Anderson&#8208;polyoxometalates with BODIPY light&#8208;absorbers using CLICK chemistry is reported. The resulting photosensitizer&#8208;polyoxometalate dyads are characterized by photophysical and theoretical methods, highlighting the electronic interactions between the sub&#8208;components, and their possible application in visible light&#8208;driven chemistry.







Abstract
The covalent attachment of molecular photosensitizers (PS) to polyoxometalates (POMs) opens new pathways to PS&#8208;POM dyads for light&#8208;driven charge&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;storage. Here, we report a synthetic route for the covalent linkage of BODIPY&#8208;dyes to Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdates by using CLICK chemistry (i.&#8201;e. copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, CuAAC). Photophysical properties of the dyad were investigated by combined experimental and theoretical methods and highlight the role of both sub&#8208;components for the charge&#8208;separation properties. The study demonstrates how CLICK chemistry can be used for the versatile linkage of organic functional units to molecular metal oxide clusters.

         <title>Prolonging the Triplet State Lifetimes of Rhenium Complexes with Imidazole&#8208;Pyridine Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 photoreduction: A series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) complexes with imidazole&#8208;pyridine framework based on the long&#8208;lived excited triplet state exhibit satisfactory stability and catalytic efficiency in photoreduction of CO2 to CO. This work emphasizes the practice and importance of tailored photocatalyst design on molecular level, representing appealing and potentially applications for phosphorescent catalysts in CO2 reduction to solar fuels.







Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into fuels offers the prospect for creating a new CO2 economy. Harnessing visible light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction mediated by the long&#8208;lived triplet excited state of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes is a challenging approach. We here develop a series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes (Re&#8208;1&#8722;Re&#8208;4) based on the imidazole&#8208;pyridine skeleton for photo&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction&lt;/b&gt;: A series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) complexes with imidazole-pyridine framework based on the long-lived excited triplet state exhibit satisfactory stability and catalytic efficiency in photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. This work emphasizes the practice and importance of tailored photocatalyst design on molecular level, representing appealing and potentially applications for phosphorescent catalysts in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to solar fuels.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into fuels offers the prospect for creating a new CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; economy. Harnessing visible light-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO reduction mediated by the long-lived triplet excited state of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes is a challenging approach. We here develop a series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes (&lt;b&gt;Re-1&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;&lt;b&gt;Re-4&lt;/b&gt;) based on the imidazole-pyridine skeleton for photo-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. These catalysts are featured by combining pyridyl-imidazole with the aromatic ring and different pendant organic groups onto the N1 position of 1,3-imidazole unit, which display phosphorescence under Ar-saturated solution even at ambient conditions. By contrast, {Re[9-(pyren-1-yl)-10-(pyridin-2-yl)-9H-pyreno[4,5-d]imidazole)](CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl} (&lt;b&gt;Re-4&lt;/b&gt;) by introducing pyrene ring at the N1 position of pyrene-fused imidazole unit exhibits superior catalytic performance with a higher turnover number for CO (TON&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=124) and &amp;gt;99.9&#8201;% selectivity, primarily ascribed to the strong visible light-harvesting ability, long-lived triplet lifetimes (164.2&#8197;&#956;s) and large reductive quenching constant. Moreover, the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes derived from &#960;-extended pyrene chromophore exhibit a long lifetime corresponding to its ligand-localized triplet state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;IL) evidenced from spectroscopic investigations and DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The dynamical interaction of n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butane and 1&#8208;butene with 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids is investigated by determining the temperature&#8208;dependent initial trapping probabilities by using molecular beam techniques. The adsorption and desorption energy increases with increasing length of the alkyl substituent of the cation, decreasing size of the anion and in the order iso&#8208;butane&lt;1&#8208;butene&lt;n&#8208;butane when changing the adsorbing molecule.







Abstract
The interaction of molecules, especially hydrocarbons, at the gas/ionic liquid (IL) surface plays a crucial role in supported IL catalysis. The dynamics of this process is investigated by measuring the trapping probabilities of n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butane and 1&#8208;butene on a set of frozen 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ILs [CnC1Im]X, where n=4, 8 and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, [PF6]&#8722; and [Tf2N]&#8722;. The decrease of the initial trapping probability with increasing surface temperature is used to determine the desorption energy of the hydrocarbons at the IL surfaces. It increases with increasing alkyl chain length n and decreasing anion size for the ILs studied. We attribute these effects to different degrees of alkyl chain surface enrichment, while interactions between the adsorbate and the anion do not play a significant role. The adsorption energy also depends on the adsorbing molecule: It decreases in the order n&#8208;butane&gt;1&#8208;butene&gt;iso&#8208;butane, which can be explained by different dispersion interactions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Aminomethylation of Aromatic Sulfones Promoted by Eosin Y</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic aminomethylation of heterocycles with organic dye is reported. The C&#8722;C bond formation through a aminomethyl radical formation enables access to a series of functionalized heterocycles in one step with no need of transition metals.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation of heteroaryls promoted by eosin Y under green light irradiation is reported. A large variety of &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilylamines as precursor of &#945;&#8208;aminomethyl radical species were engaged to functionalize sulfonyl&#8208;heteroaryls following a Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (HAS) pathway. This method has provided a range of &#945;&#8208;aminoheteroaryl compounds including a functionalized natural product. The mechanism of this late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryls was investigated and suggests the formation of a sulfonyl radical intermediate over a reductive quenching cycle.

         <title>Alkali Metal Complexes of a Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane Functionalized Amidinate Ligand: Synthesis and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined functionalities: A bis(diphenylphosphino)methane functionalized amidine was synthesized and employed as a ligand for the whole alkali metal series. The resulting complexes show interesting photophysical properties, revealing differences in emission with regards to the respective alkali metal. In addition, a caesium derivative was obtained by cleavage of a diphenylphosphino moiety, forming an unusual six&#8208;membered ring structure in the solid state.







Abstract
A novel bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (DPPM) functionalized amidine ligand (DPPM&#8722;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2H) (Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) was synthesized. Subsequent deprotonation with suitable alkali metal bases resulted in the corresponding complexes [M{DPPM&#8722;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2}(Ln)] (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; L=thf, Et2O). The alkali metal complexes form monomeric species in the solid state, exhibiting intramolecular metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interactions. In addition, a caesium derivative [Cs{PPh2CH2&#8208;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2}]6 was obtained by cleavage of a diphenylphosphino moiety, forming an unusual six&#8208;membered ring structure in the solid state. All complexes were fully characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. Furthermore, the photoluminescent properties of the complexes were thoroughly investigated, revealing differences in emission with regards to the respective alkali metal. Interestingly, the hexanuclear [Cs{PPh2CH2&#8208;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2}]6 metallocycle exhibits a blue emission in the solid state, which is significantly red&#8208;shifted at low temperatures. The bifunctional design of the ligand, featuring orthogonal donor atoms (N vs. P) and a high steric demand, is highly promising for the construction of advanced metal and main group complexes.

         <title>A Novel Strategy to Design and Construct AIE&#8208;active Mechanofluorochromic Materials via Regulation of Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives were synthesized and investigated with regulation of molecular structure. The results illustrated that these compounds exhibited obvious AIE characteristics. The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene rings) causes twisted conformations of the molecules that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid&#8208;state emission. Significantly, two of these compounds also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior with color changes between blue and green emissions.







Abstract
In this work, we first designed and synthesized tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives TM&#8208;1&#8211;4 via regulation of molecular structure, which were consisted of 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline, 1H&#8208;phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole, 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)dipyridine moieties and AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene units, respectively. The results illustrated that TM&#8208;1&#8211;4 exhibited clear AIE characteristics. Meanwhile, TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 show excellent solid emission properties (&#934;TM&#8208;2=13.73&#8201;% and &#934;TM&#8208;3=36.21&#8201;%), whereas TM&#8208;1 and TM&#8208;4 exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;TM&#8208;1=1.48&#8201;% and &#934;TM&#8208;4=4.83&#8201;%). The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene ring) causes twisted conformations of the molecule that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid emission(&#934;TM&#8208;2&lt;&#934;TM&#8208;3, &#934;TM&#8208;1&lt;&#934;TM&#8208;4). Significantly, TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;TM&#8208;2=43&#8197;nm and &#916;&#955;TM&#8208;3=41&#8197;nm) with color changes between blue and green emissions.

     alt="A Novel Strategy to Design and Construct AIE-active Mechanofluorochromic Materials via Regulation of Molecular Structure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this work&lt;/b&gt;, tetraphenylene-fused aryl-imidazole derivatives were synthesized and investigated with regulation of molecular structure. The results illustrated that these compounds exhibited obvious AIE characteristics. The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene rings) causes twisted conformations of the molecules that prevents &#960;-&#960; stacking and enhances solid-state emission. Significantly, two of these compounds also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior with color changes between blue and green emissions.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we first designed and synthesized tetraphenylene-fused aryl-imidazole derivatives &lt;b&gt;TM-1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; via regulation of molecular structure, which were consisted of 1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline, 1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole, 4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole, 3,3&#8242;-(1H-imidazole-4,5-diyl)dipyridine moieties and AIE-active tetraphenylethene units, respectively. The results illustrated that &lt;b&gt;TM-1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibited clear AIE characteristics. Meanwhile, &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt; show excellent solid emission properties (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;

   &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=36.21&#8201;%), whereas &lt;b&gt;TM-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TM-4&lt;/b&gt; exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TM-1&lt;/b&gt;

Significantly, &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt; also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>A Study in Red: The Overlooked Role of Azo&#8208;Moieties in Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Strongly Extended Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique optical and photoredox properties of heptazine&#8208;based polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials make them promising semiconductors for driving various productive photocatalytic conversions. However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430&#8208;450 nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting.  Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450 nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high&#8208;temperature (900 &#176;C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de&#8208;ammonification leads to the formation of azo&#8208;groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible&#8208;light (470 nm) for H  2  evolution even without any additional co&#8208;catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge&#8208;trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N &#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99.5% ee ) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers have been extensively studied in recent years. Some of these materials can exhibit several properties such as permanent porosity, high surface area, thermostability and light emission, as well as open sites for chemical functionalization. Concerning the fact that this kind of compounds are usually solids, the size and morphology of the particles are important parameters when an application is desired. Inside this context, there is a subclass of coordination polymers, named Infinite Coordination Polymers (ICPs), which auto&#8208;organize as micro&#8208; or nanoparticles with low crystallinity. Specifically, the particles exhibiting spherical shapes and reduced sizes can be better dispersed, enter cells much easier than bulk crystals and be converted to inorganic materials by topotactic transformation. Luminescent ICPs, in particular, can find applications in several areas, such as sensing probes, light&#8208;emitting devices and bioimaging. In this review, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of ICP&#8208;based spherical particles, including the growth mechanisms, some applications for luminescent ICPs and the challenges to overcome in future commercial usage of these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkoxylation of Alkynes: An Overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come fore as one of the reliable method for the construction of oxygen bearing entities. In this domain, plethora of strategies describing hydroalkoxylation/hydroalkoxylation accompanied cascade reactions of alkynes have been reported for the construction of oxygen bearing complex heterocycles in a diastereo&#8208; as well as enantioselective manner.







Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;bearing motifs, mainly the congener heterocycles are ubiquitous due to their presence in various natural products and bioactive scaffolds. Although in literature, several strategies have been developed for their synthesis, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come forward as a method of choice and has been used extensively. In particular, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has gained enormous attention from the synthetic community due to the rapid access to a very useful and reactive synthetic intermediate like &#8216;enol ether&#8217;. Furthermore, to manifold the utility of these methods, reports have been developed elaborating the generation of &#8216;enol ether&#8217; using hydroalkoxylation and their usage in various reactions in cascade or tandem manner. This review focuses on recent development on the hydroalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxygen&#8208;containing entities.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, the general thermodynamics for the formation of intermetallics have been discussed, followed by the introduction of two main approaches for the synthesis of intermetallics and the corresponding techniques. Then, the application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis has been illustrated case by case.

Abstract
Characterized by long&#8208;range atomic ordering, well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, and controlled crystal structure, intermetallics have attracted increasing attention in the area of chemical synthesis and catalytic applications. Liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics has arisen as the promising methodology due to its precise control over size, shape, and resistance toward sintering compared with the traditional metallurgy. This short review tends to provide perspectives on the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics in terms of both thermodynamics and methodology, as well as its applications in various catalytic reactions. Specifically, basic thermodynamics and kinetics in the synthesis of intermetallics will be first discussed, followed by discussing the main factors that will affect the formation of intermetallics during synthesis. The application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis will be demonstrated case by case at last. We conclude the review with perspectives on the future developments with respect to both synthesis and catalytic applications.

         <title>Lewis Superacidic Tellurenyl Cation&#8208;Induced Electrophilic Activation of an Inert Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8722;H bond activation: The Lewis superacidic aryltellurenyl cation [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te]+ increases the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the weakly coordinating carborane anion (CB11H12)&#8722; by more than 120 orders of magnitude. Upon heating, the formal B&#8722;H bond is converted into an acidic N&#8722;H bond, while a Te&#8722;B bond is formed. A mechanism for the electrophilic substitution is proposed.







Abstract
The aryltellurenyl cation [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te]+, a Lewis super acid, and the weakly coordinating carborane anion [CB11H12]&#8722;, an extremely weak Br&#248;nsted acid (pKa=131.0 in MeCN), form an isolable ion pair complex [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][CB11H12], in which the Br&#248;nsted acidity (pKa 7.4 in MeCN) of the formally hydridic B&#8722;H bonds is dramatically increased by more than 120 orders of magnitude. The electrophilic activation of B&#8722;H bonds in the carborane moiety gives rise to a proton transfer from boron to nitrogen at slightly elevated temperatures, as rationalized by the isolation of a mixture of the zwitterionic isomers 12&#8208; and 7&#8208;[2&#8208;(tBuN{H}CH)C6H4Te(CB11H11)] in ratios ranging from 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 80&#8201;:&#8201;20.

         <title>C4&#8217;&#8208;Fluorinated Oligodeoxynucleotides: Synthesis, Stability, Structural Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;Thymidine was synthesized and introduced into DNA strands based on standard solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis protocols. The 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;thymidine in the context of DNA strand is rather stable in neutral buffers. Unlike native deoxyribonucleosides whose ribose predominantly exist in the South conformation, 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;thymidine prefers the North conformation. Incorporation of 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside into nucleic acids represents an advanced approach to modulate the local structure and, hence, the function of nucleic acids.







Abstract
Fluoro&#8208;substitution on the ribose moiety (e.&#8201;g., 2&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide) represents a popular way to modulate the ribose conformation and, hence, the structure and function of nucleic acids. In the present study, we synthesized 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxythymidine (4&#8217;&#8208;FT) and introduced it to oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs). Though scission of the glycosylic bond of 4&#8217;&#8208;FT followed by strand cleavage occurred to some extent under alkaline conditions, the 4&#8217;&#8208;FT&#8208;modified ODNs were rather stable in neutral buffers. NMR studies showed that like 2&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside, 4&#8217;&#8208;FT exists predominantly in the North conformation not only in the nucleoside form but also in the context of ODN strands. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, thermal denaturing and RNase H1 footprinting studies of 4&#8217;&#8208;FT&#8208;modified ODN/cDNA and ODN/cRNA duplexes indicated that the North conformation tendency of 4&#8217;&#8208;FT is maintained in the duplexes, leading to a local structural perturbation. Collectively, 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide structurally resembles the 2&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide but imparts less structural perturbation to the duplex than the latter.

Core subjects: Two new early transition metal (Zr or Hf)&#8211;protected octaborane derivatives, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; M=Zr (1&#8208;Zr) and Hf (1&#8208;Hf)) have been isolated and structurally characterized. The solid&#8208;state structures of both 1&#8208;Zr and 1&#8208;Hf comprise a B8 dodecahedron core protected by {Cp2MBH3} moieties on both sides of the cluster. The spectroscopic data also validate the intactness of the B8 dodecahedron core in the solution as well.







Abstract
Despite the synthesis and structural characterization of closo&#8208;hydroborate dianions, [BnHn]2&#8722; (n=6&#8211;12) more than 50&#8197;years ago, some ambiguity remains about the structure of [B8H8]2&#8722;. Although the solid&#8208;state structure of [B8H8]2&#8722; was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies in 1969, fast rearrangements in solution at accessible temperatures prevented its detailed characterization. We therefore stabilized a derivative of [B8H8]2&#8722; by using Cp2MBH3 and structurally characterized two new octaborane analogues, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; M=Zr (1&#8208;Zr) and Hf (1&#8208;Hf)), so that the dynamics of the B8 skeleton were arrested. The solid&#8208;state structures of both 1&#8208;Zr and 1&#8208;Hf comprise a dodecahedron core protected by {Cp2MBH3} moieties on both sides of the cluster. Spectroscopic characterization (11B NMR) validates the intactness of the B8 dodecahedron core in solution as well. Theoretical calculations establish that the two exo&#8208;{Cp2MBH3} fragments provide structural and electronic structural stability to the B8 core and its intact dodecahedral dianionic nature. Furthermore, we propose isodesmic equations for the formation of higher analogues of the Bn core (n&gt;8) guarded by different group 4 transition metals. Our analysis suggests that, as we move to higher polyhedra (n&gt;10), the formation becomes unfavourable irrespective of metal.

   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; core (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;8) guarded by different group 4 transition metals. Our analysis suggests that, as we move to higher polyhedra (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;10), the formation becomes unfavourable irrespective of metal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Cyanation of Primary and Secondary Amines with Cyanobenzio&#8208;doxolone (CBX) Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More stability, less toxicity: We demonstrate an efficient electrophilic N&#8208;cyanation of primary and secondary amines with a stable and less&#8208;toxic cyanobenziodoxole reagent. This synthetically practicable strategy allows the construction of a wide variety of cyanamides under very mild and simple conditions with a broad functional group compatibility, which provides a complementary method to existing procedures for the synthesis of cyanamides.







Abstract
An efficient electrophilic N&#8208;cyanation of amines with a stable and less&#8208;toxic cyanobenziodoxole reagent towards the synthesis of cyanamides is disclosed. This synthetically practicable strategy allows the construction of a wide variety of cyanamides under very mild and simple conditions with a broad functional group compatibility, and showcases a huge potential in late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promoting renewable energy production: LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts have been prepared by a sol&#8208;gel protocol. Subsequent calcination at 700&#8201;&#176;C yields a macroporous material with modest surface area. Hydrogen reduction induces surface defects, in particular a high concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits a significantly higher current density at lower overpotential, with faster kinetics and superior stability for oxygen evolution for water splitting.







Abstract
Perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high efficiency and durability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influence their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700&#8201;&#176;C calcined LaNiO3 induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO3; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of 380&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ valence states, which quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Further, it reveals that the formation of oxygen vacancies is thermodynamically more favourable on the surface than in the bulk; it increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO3 in accordance with the enhanced OER activity that is observed.

         <title>A Diazirine&#8208;Modified Membrane Lipid to Study Peptide/Lipid Interactions &#8211; Chances and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can diazirine&#8208;modified lipids be used to locate the position of UV&#8208;induced cross&#8208;links between this lipid and a membrane peptide by using MS? Although DiazPC fulfils all prerequisites for a photo&#8208;activatable membrane lipid to study protein/lipid interactions and the cross&#8208;links can be exactly assigned, we observed a backfolding of the lipid's alkyl chain. This is a general phenomenon for any type of membrane lipids with a hydrophilic group in the alkyl chain.







Abstract
Although incorporation of photo&#8208;activatable lipids into membranes potentially opens up novel avenues for investigating interactions with proteins, the question of whether diazirine&#8208;modified lipids are suitable for such studies, remains under debate. Focusing on the potential for studying lipid/peptide interactions by cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS), we developed a diazirine&#8208;modified lipid (DiazPC), and examined its behaviour in membranes incorporating the model &#945;&#8208;helical peptide LAVA20. We observed an unexpected backfolding of the diazirine&#8208;containing stearoyl chain of the lipid. This surprising behaviour challenges the potential application of DiazPC for future XL&#8208;MS studies of peptide and protein/lipid interactions. The observations made for DiazPC most likely represent a general phenomenon for any type of membrane lipids with a polar moiety incorporated into the alkyl chain. Our finding is therefore of importance for future protein/lipid interaction studies relying on modified lipid probes.

The excited coinage metal catch, or how to form luminescent hetero&#8208;bimetallic lanthanide coinage metal compounds. The cover picture depicts how the ligand system dpfam, represented by an octopus, can form preformed lanthanide scaffolds that can catch silver or gold cations. Upon excitation of the system, the octopus can force the two different metal centres to interact. The new deep&#8208;sea dwellers obtained illuminate the dark ocean and reveal a new class of interesting hetero&#8208;bimetallic compounds.

         <dc:description>
There is a pressing engineering need to produce hexagonal SiGe, that is untemplated, to be able to develop optoelectronic devices with hex&#8208;SiGe and Si integrated on the same chip. We have contributed the timely, broad&#8208;interest advance of producing a bulk hexagonal SiGe landscape and explain how and under what conditions each Si&#8211;Ge composition becomes hexagonal. Moreover, the ability to synthesize different hexagonal polytypes affords further tailoring of optoelectronic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Serghiou et&#8197;al.

         <title>From the {FeIII2Ln2} butterfly's perspective: the magnetic benefits and challenges of cooperativity within 3d&#8208;4f based coordination clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this perspective review we discuss the tuning handles which can be used to steer the magnetic properties of FeIII&#8208;4f &#8220;butterfly&#8221; compounds. The majority of presented compounds were produced in the context of project A3 &#8220;Di&#8208; to tetranuclear compounds incorporating highly anisotropic paramagnetic metal ions&#8221; within the SFB/TRR88 &#8220;3MET&#8221;. These contain {FeIII2Ln2} cores encapsulated in ligand shells which are easy to tune in a &#8220;test&#8208;bed&#8221; system. We identify the following advantages and variables in such systems: (i) the complexes are structurally simple usually with one crystallographically independent FeIII and LnIII, respectively. This simplifies theory and anaylsis; (ii) choosing Fe allows 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to be used as an additional technique which can give information about oxidation levels and spin states, local moments at the iron nuclei and spin&#8208;relaxation and, more importantly, about the anisotropy not only of the studied isotope, but also of elements interacting with this isotope; (iii) isostructural analogues with all the available (i.e. not Pm) 4f ions can be synthesised, enabling a systematic survey of the influence of the 4f ion on the electronic structure; (iv) this cluster type is obtained by reacting [FeIII3O(O2CR)6(L)3](X) (X = anion, L = solvent such as H2O, py) with an ethanolamine&#8208;based ligand L&#8217; and lanthanide salts. This allows to study analogues of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(L&#8217;)2(O2CR)6] using the appropriate iron trinuclear starting materials. (v) the organic main ligand can be readily functionalised, facilitating a systematic investigation of the effect of organic substituents on the ligands on the magnetic properties of the complexes. We describe and discuss 34 {MIII2Ln2} (M = Fe or in one case Al) butterfly compounds which have been reported up to 2020. The analysis of these gives perspectives for designing new SMM systems with specific electronic and magnetic signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation of mechanical properties of polymer materials with those of their molecular constituents is the foundation for their holistic comprehension and eventually for improved material designs and syntheses. Over the last decade, optical force probes (OFPs) were developed, shedding light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials. The properties of polymers are diverse, ranging from soft hydrogels to ultra&#8208;tough composites, from purely elastic rubbers to viscous colloidal solutions, and from transparent glasses to super black dyed coatings. Only very recently, researchers started to develop tailored OFP solutions that account for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. We here highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Slow&#8208;Magnetic Relaxation in Pristine Ferrocenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the spin dynamic properties of non&#8208;substituted ferrocenium complexes. Ferrocenium shows a field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in DMF solution while cobaltocene lacks of slow spin relaxation neither in powder nor in solution. Multireference quantum mechanical calculations give a non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation for ferrocenium with small first excitation energy that agrees with the relatively large measured magnetic anisotropy for a transition metal S=1/2 system. The analysis of the spin relaxation shows an important participation of quantum tunnelling, Raman, direct and local&#8208;mode mechanisms which depend on temperature and the external field conditions. The calculation of spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants for the vibrational modes shows that the first vibrational mode, despite having a low spin&#8208;phonon constant, is the most efficient process for the spin relaxation at low temperatures. In such conditions, vibrational modes with higher spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants are not populated. Additionally, the vibrational energy of this first mode is in excellent agreement with the experimental fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing&#8208;Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Breathing exercises: Two Zn&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks showed reversible structural flexibility through the breathing phenomenon upon the addition and removal of guest molecules. Moreover, these two MOF compounds demonstrated selective sorption of C8 alkyl aromatics in their binary mixtures.







Abstract
The breathing phenomenon in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has revealed supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions that could be beneficial for chemical separation in numerous industrial applications. The cost&#8208;effective purification of C8 alkyl aromatics such as o&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, p&#8208;xylene, and ethylbenzene remains challenging owing to their similar molecular structures, boiling points, kinetic diameters, polarities, etc. Herein, we report two Zn&#8208;based pillar&#8208;bilayered MOFs, denoted [Zn2(aip)2(pillar)] (aip=5&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid; pillar: bpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or bpe=1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) that exhibit a breathing effect depending on the adsorbed guest molecules. Guest&#8208;dependent sorption studies in organic solvents such as N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide, methanol, benzene, and water vapor display reversible structural flexibility through the breathing effect in both framework compounds. The experiments conducted on C8&#8208;alkyl aromatics resulting in both MOF compounds can access these isomers in the shrunken pores, and thereby expand the pore size by framework breathing. In C8 binary mixtures, these Zn&#8208;MOFs exhibit selective sorption properties based on the different interactions between guest C8 aromatics and the framework structure.

         <dc:description>Carbonyl and iminyl based radical anions are reactive intermediates in a variety of transformations in organic synthesis. Herein, the isolation of ketyl, and more importantly unprecedented ketiminyl and aldiminyl radical anions coordinated to cobalt and iron complexes is presented. Insights into the electronic structure of these unusual metal bound radical anions is provided by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis, NMR, IR, UV/Vis and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, solid and solution state magnetometry, as well as a by a detailed computational analysis. The metal bound radical anions are very reactive and facilitate the activation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular C&#8211;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane as a Source of 1,2&#8208;Diphosphacyclobutadiene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of iron and cobalt metalates with di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane readily afford 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The corresponding 1,3&#8208;isomers were accessed by dimerisation of tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne on the metal centre. The reactivity of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward electrophiles was studied and the electronic structures of the new metalates were investigated by spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Reactions of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (1) with cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208; or anthracene&#8208;stabilised metalate anions of iron and cobalt consistently afford complexes of the rarely encountered 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene ligand, which have previously been very challenging synthetic targets. The subsequent reactivity of 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward various electrophiles has also been investigated and is compared to reactions of related 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The results highlight the distinct reactivity of such isomeric species, showing that the 1,2&#8208;isomers can act as precursors for previously unknown triphospholium ligands. The electronic structures of the new complexes were investigated by several methods, including NMR, EPR and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopies as well as quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Revisiting Alkane Hydroxylation with m&#8208;CPBA (m&#8208;Chloroperbenzoic Acid) Catalyzed by Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylation of alkanes with m&#8208;CPBA (m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid) catalyzed by NiII&#8208;complexes was investigated. Based on the detailed mechanistic studies, we propose that both (L)NiII&#8722;O. and aroyloxyl radical species generated by the O&#8722;O bond homolysis of a (L)NiII&#8208;m&#8208;CPBA adduct a contribute to the hydrogen atom abstraction process from the substrates in the alkane hydroxylation reaction.







Abstract
Mechanistic studies are performed on the alkane hydroxylation with m&#8208;CPBA (m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid) catalyzed by nickel(II) complexes, NiII(L). In the oxidation of cycloalkanes, NiII(TPA) acts as an efficient catalyst with a high yield and a high alcohol selectivity. In the oxidation of adamantane, the tertiary carbon is predominantly oxidized. The reaction rate shows first&#8208;order dependence on [substrate] and [NiII(L)] but is independent on [m&#8208;CPBA]; vobs=k2[substrate][NiII(L)]. The reaction exhibited a relatively large kinetic deuterium isotope effect (KIE) of 6.7, demonstrating that the hydrogen atom abstraction is involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, NiII(L) supported by related tetradentate ligands exhibit apparently different catalytic activity, suggesting contribution of the NiII(L) in the catalytic cycle. Based on the kinetic analysis and the significant effects of O2 and CCl4 on the product distribution pattern, possible contributions of (L)NiII&#8722;O. and the aroyloxyl radical as the reactive oxidants are discussed.

         <title>An Adjustable Cleft Based on an 8&#8208;Sulfonamide&#8208;2&#8208;Naphthoic Acid with Oxyanion Hole Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The torsion angle around the sulfonamide bond gives these oxyanion hole&#8208;like receptors a variable size cleft. As stronger H&#8208;bonds imply shorter distances between H&#8208;bond donors and acceptors, these clefts with sulfonamide and carboxamide functions might be of interest in catalysis. X&#8208;ray crystal structures confirm the formation of two strong linear H&#8208;bonds between the NHs and carbonyl or alcohol oxygens, showing the adaptability of the cleft.







Abstract
Cleft type receptors showing the oxyanion hole motif have been prepared in a straightforward synthesis starting from the commercial 3,7&#8208;dihidroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic acid. The double H&#8208;bond donor pattern is achieved by the introduction of a sulfonamide group in the C&#8208;8 position of naphthalene and a carboxamide at the C&#8208;2 position. This cleft, for which the geometry resembles that of an oxyanion hole, is able to adjust to different guests, as shown by the analysis of the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of associates with methanol or acetic acid. Combination of hydrogen bonds and charge&#8208;transfer interactions led to further stabilization of the complexes, in which the electron&#8208;rich aromatic ring of the receptor was close in space to the electron&#8208;deficient dinitroaromatic guests. Modelling studies and bidimensional NMR experiments have been carried out to provide additional information.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Glucocerebrosidase Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited deficiencies in &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Current treatments require rapid disease diagnosis and a means of monitoring therapeutic efficacy, both of which may be supported by the use of GBA&#8208;targeting activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). Here, we report the synthesis and structural analysis of a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs for GBA. We demonstrate their covalent mechanism&#8208;based mode of action and uncover binding of the new  N&#8208;  functionalised aziridines to the ligand binding cleft. These inhibitors became scaffolds for the development of ABPs; the O6&#8208;fluorescent tags of which bind in an allosteric site at the dimer interface. Considering GBA&#8217;s preference for O6&#8208; and  N  &#8208;functionalised reagents, we synthesised a bi&#8208;functional aziridine ABP which we hoped would offer a more powerful imaging agent. Whilst this ABP binds to two unique active site clefts of GBA, no further benefit in potency was achieved over our first generation ABPs. Nevertheless, such ABPs should serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to GD and inform the design of future probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reactions of thiophenolates with geminal bis(acceptor)&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in DMSO at 20 &#176;C was monitored by photometric methods. The determined second&#8208;order rate constants of the S  N  2 reactions followed linear relationships with Mayr nucleophilicity parameters (  N  /  s  N  ) and Br&#248;nsted basicities (p  K  aH  ) of the thiophenolates as well as with Hammett substituent parameters (&#963;) for groups attached to the thiophenolates. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted by up to a factor of 15 faster than their unsubstituted analogues, in accord with the known activating effect of adjacent &#960;&#8208;systems in S  N  2 reactions. Variation of electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, inherent S  N  2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;systems because of more advanced C1&#8208;C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, also electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.</dc:description>

Variation of electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, inherent S  N  2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron-rich &#960;-systems because of more advanced C1-C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, also electron-poor &#960;-systems lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The innate immunity TLR4/MD&#8208;2 system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We here combine  ab&#8208;initio  calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies reveal functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular TIR domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)  2  architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8211; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8211;N = bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#183;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2. The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;3CH3CN and [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;2SO2 were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations.

         <title>Effect of Arylmethylene Substitutions on Molecular Structure, Optoelectronic Properties and Photovoltaic Performance of Dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>
Arylmethylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains: Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains have been developed to systemically investigate the impact of arylmethylene substitution and its number on molecular structure, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Better light&#8208;harvesting properties and molecular planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMO levels are achieved, enabling improvements in device efficiency both for halogenated and non&#8208;halogenated processing solvents.







Abstract
Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) were developed that feature methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains, to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA without conjugated side chains. The synthesized SMAs were tested in polymer solar cells for examples of their applicability. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.

         <title>Elastic organic crystals based on barbituric derivative: multifaceted bending and flexible optical waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multifaceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative  DBDT  , which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH  3  OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (  H  ) and elastic modulus (  E  ) were 0.28 &#177; 0.01 GPa and 4.56 &#177; 0.03 GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O) and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627 nm were 0.7 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 0.9 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 1.8 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state) at 567 nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterated Indocyanine Green (ICG) with Extended Aqueous Storage Shelf&#8208;Life: Chemical and Clinical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuterium atom in the right place mitigates the 60&#8208;year problem of aqueous Indocyanine Green (ICG) instability. A clinical stock solution of heavy ICG in water can be stored for an extended period without significant loss of fluorescence brightness; this will improve the effectiveness of various biomedical imaging, diagnostic and therapy procedures.







Abstract
Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dye that is used extensively for various imaging and diagnostic procedures. One drawback with ICG is its instability in water, which means that reconstituted clinical doses have to be used very shortly after preparation. Two deuterated versions of ICG were prepared with deuterium atoms on the heptamethine chain, and the spectral, physiochemical, and photostability properties were quantified. A notable mechanistic finding is that self&#8208;aggregation of ICG in water strongly favors dye degradation by a photochemical oxidative dimerization reaction that gives a nonfluorescent product. Storage stability studies showed that replacement of C&#8722;H with C&#8722;D decreased the dimerization rate constant by a factor of 3.1, and it is likely that many medical and preclinical procedures will benefit from the longer shelf&#8208;lives of these two deuterated ICG dyes. The discovery that ICG self&#8208;aggregation promotes photoinduced electron transfer can be exploited as a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation photodynamic therapies.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting tetrahydrides: First&#8208;principles calculations show that the distance between the hydrogen atoms comprising the quasi&#8208;molecular H2 units in the metal tetrahydrides that emerge as being stable under pressure can be tuned via the choice of the metal, as well as chemical and physical pressure. Vibrations of the H&#8722;H bond are important for the superconducting mechanism.







Abstract
Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr2Si2 structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these 
 symmetry MH4 compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H
 units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH4, ScH4 and ZrH4 reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H
 units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH4, modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms are also key contributors, and soften substantially at lower pressures.

         <title>Revised Structures of Dehydrostenines A and B: Total Syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;Dehydrostenine A and Structure Assigned to Dehydrostenine B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total syntheses of the Stemona alkaloid dehydrostenine A and the structure assigned to dehydrostenine B have been completed from a simple pyrrole substrate in 10 and 11 steps, respectively. Two independent Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular Michael additions were exploited to construct the tetracyclic dehydrostenine core. As a result of our synthetic studies and associated analysis of the relevant literature, we propose revisions of the structures originally assigned to dehydrostenines A and B.

         <title>The Synthesis of Porous Na3V2(PO4)3 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. We first review the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials. Furthermore, we outline the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field.







Abstract
Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to its excellent structural stability and rapid Na+ conductivity. However, its electrochemical performances are restricted by the large bulk structure and poor electronic conductivity. The construction of porous NVP materials is a powerful method to improve the electrochemical properties. This concept aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. Herein, the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials are reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field are outlined.

         <title>Protection of Ag Clusters by Metal&#8208;Oxo Modules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules have emerged as the new stars of silver nanoclusters, exhibiting enhanced and unique properties. Three types of metal&#8208;oxo modules are identified in these systems. Some insights into fabricating such clusters and problems to be solved are discussed in this Concept article.







Abstract
Monodisperse and atomically precise Ag nanoclusters have attracted considerable recent research interest. A conventional silver cluster usually consists of a silver metallic kernel and an organic peripheral ligand shell. Nevertheless, the present inevitable problem is the unsatisfied stability of such nanoclusters. In this concept, we will give an introduction to Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules, which exhibit enhanced stability and unique properties. Accordingly, three different types of clusters are summarized: (1) Ag clusters protected by mononuclear oxometallates; (2) Ag clusters protected by block&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters; (3) Ag clusters protected by hollow&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters. The aim of this concept is to offer possible general guidance and insight into future rational design of more metal&#8208;oxo clusters protected silver clusters or even other coinage metal nanoclusters.

Our question was how to regioselectively introduce a halogen atom into valuable phenylalanine derivatives without using a heavy protecting group in order to rapidly construct nonproteinogenic amino acids. The proposed solution was a Pd&#8208;catalyzed and sustainable regioselective C&#8722;H halogenation process directed by a native amine functional group.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein, we summarize the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Then, we also introduce the recent new insight about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High Fidelity Enzyme&#8208;Free Primer Extension with an Ethynylpyridone Thymidine Analog</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High fidelity base pairing is important for the transmission of genetic information. Weak base pairs can lower fidelity, complicating sequencing, amplification and replication of DNA.&#160; Thymidine 5'&#8208;monophosphate (TMP) is the most weakly pairing nucleotide among the canonical deoxynucleotides, causing high errors rates in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. &#160;Here we report the synthesis of an ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside analog of 3'&#8208;amino&#8208;2',3'&#8208;dideoxythymidine monophosphate and its incorporation in a growing strand by enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. The ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleotide accelerates extension more than five&#8208;fold, reduces misincorporation and readily displaces TMP in competition experiments. The results bode well for the use of the  C  &#8208;nucleoside as replacements for thymidine in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals.

         <title>Development of the Peripheral Functionalization Chemistry of meso&#8208;Free Corroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since reliable synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles were developed, the peripheral functionalization chemistry of corroles has blossomed again. In this Minireview, classical electrophilic reactions, SNAr reactions, and unique oxidation behavior are introduced, and their impact on the structures, electronic states, optical properties, and aromaticities of corroles are highlighted.







Abstract
In contrast to the extensive development of the meso&#8208;functionalization of porphyrins, that of corroles had rarely been explored until the development of practical synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles in 2015. The ready availability of meso&#8208;free corroles opened up meso&#8208;functionalization chemistry of corroles, giving rise to successful synthesis of various meso&#8208;substituted corroles such as meso&#8208;halogen, meso&#8208;nitro, meso&#8208;amino, meso&#8208;oxo, and meso&#8208;iminocorroles as well as meso&#8211;meso&#8208;linked corrole dimers and corrole tapes. In some cases, 2NH corroles exist as stable or transient radical species. The impact of meso&#8208;functionalization on the structures, electronic properties, optical characteristics, and aromaticity of corroles are highlighted in this Minireview.

         <title>DNA Adduct Detection after Post&#8208;Labeling Technique with PCR Amplification (DNA&#8208;ADAPT&#8211;qPCR) Identifies the Pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA Gene as a Direct Target of Platinum&#8211;Acridine Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA damage caused by a platinum&#8211;acridine agent in cancer cells was studied by using an assay that combines post&#8208;labeling of click chemistry&#8208;enabled DNA adducts, affinity pull&#8208;down purification, and PCR amplification. The method demonstrates that rDNA repeats are a cellular, and potentially pharmacological, target of the hybrid agents.







Abstract
To study the DNA damage caused by a potent platinum&#8211;acridine anticancer agent (PA) in cancer cells, an assay based on biorthogonal post&#8208;labeling using a click chemistry&#8208;enabled, azide&#8208;modified derivative (APA) was developed. The method involves biotinylation, affinity capture, and bead&#8208;based enrichment of APA&#8208;modified genomic DNA. The key steps of the assay were validated and optimized in model duplexes, including full&#8208;length plasmids, restriction fragments, and a DNA ladder. Native DNA treated with APA and subsequently subjected to post&#8208;labeling with a biotin affinity tag was enzymatically digested and fragments were analyzed by in&#8208;line LC&#8211;MS and MS/MS. The monofunctional&#8211;intercalative adducts formed by APA in 5&#8242;&#8208;pyrimidine/guanine sequences in double&#8208;stranded DNA were quantitatively biotinylated by strain&#8208;promoted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition chemistry. When applied to DNA extracted from A549 lung cancer cells, the assay in combination with qPCR amplification demonstrates that platinum&#8211;acridines form adducts in the gene sequences encoding pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA, a potential pharmacological target of these agents.

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Blue OLEDs with EQE up to 7.5% Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with HLCT state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, we successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters,  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  and  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  , featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high PLQYs and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  and  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an EQE  max  of 4.32% and 5.41%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  was achieved with an excellent CE  max  of 5.83 cd A  &#8208;1  , EQE  max  of 4.6% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly,  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  &#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQE  max  of 7.51% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIE  y&#160;  &#65308;&#160;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T  7  to S  2  . Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Supramolecular Organic Frameworks Constructed by Amidinium&#8208;Carboxylate Salt Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation, TPE4+, and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. These self&#8208;assembled structures can be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli and are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8201;%&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation.







Abstract
We report here a set of fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) that incorporate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) units within their frameworks. The fluorescent SOFs of this study were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation TPE4+ and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray di&#64256;raction analyses revealed that the length of the dicarboxylate anion bridges has a considerable impact on the structural features of the resulting frameworks. Nevertheless, all SOFs prepared in the context of the present study were found to display emissive features characteristic of TPE&#8208;based AIE luminogens with only a modest dependence on the structural specifics being seen. The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli. This reversible structural behavior is consistent with their SOF nature.

         <title>Hybrid EuIII Coordination Luminophore Standing on Two Legs on Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hold tight, shine bright: A novel method for the development of lanthanide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, taking advantage of an EuIII complex with an organic ligand covalently bound to the silica nanoparticle supports at two binding sites has been demonstrated. The hybrid nanoluminophore exhibited higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previous EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials.







Abstract
In this study, we have demonstrated a two&#8208;legged, upright molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent LnIII&#8208;silica nanomaterials. A novel EuIII&#8208;silica hybrid nanoparticle was developed by using a doubly binding TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 (TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) linker. The TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 was confirmed by 1H, 31P, 29Si NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Luminescent Eu(hfa)3 and Eu(tfc)3 moieties (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3&#8208;(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed onto TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3&#8208;modified silica nanoparticles, producing Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2 and Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2, respectively. Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 exhibited the higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 showed an extra&#8208;large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54&#8201;%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3)2 was found to be 39&#8201;%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 linker is a promising candidate for development of EuIII&#8208;based luminescent materials.

         <title>Large Isotope Effects in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs, kH/kD) above the typical limit of 7 are reviewed, for organometallic reaction types from protonation of clusters to catalytic C&#8722;H activation. The KIEs are as large as 105, or even so large that reactivity is unobserved for deuterium. Large KIEs in organometallics have been explained by a combination of (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step.







Abstract
The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is key to understanding reaction mechanisms in many areas of chemistry and chemical biology, including organometallic chemistry. This ratio of rate constants, kH/kD, typically falls between 1&#8211;7. However, KIEs up to 105 have been reported, and can even be so large that reactivity with deuterium is unobserved. We collect here examples of large KIEs across organometallic chemistry, in catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, along with their mechanistic interpretations. Large KIEs occur in proton transfer reactions such as protonation of organometallic complexes and clusters, protonolysis of metal&#8211;carbon bonds, and dihydrogen reactivity. C&#8722;H activation reactions with large KIEs occur with late and early transition metals, photogenerated intermediates, and abstraction by metal&#8208;oxo complexes. We categorize the mechanistic interpretations of large KIEs into the following three types: (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step. This comprehensive collection of large KIEs in organometallics provides context for future mechanistic interpretation.

         <title>Domino dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension &#8211; a facile path to extended perylenes and terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new method of synthesis of extended perylenes and terrylenes. The technique is based on the cascade dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) of aryl aldehydes, where stepwise annulations activate previously &#8220;dormant&#8221; substituents. Two&#8208;fold and four&#8208;fold cyclizations of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehydes offer a rapid path to unsymmetrical perylenes and elusive terrylene derivatives, respectively. DPEX of 3,3''&#8208;(phenanthrene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl)bis (([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)) leads to the biradical structure, which in situ proceeds into oxidative electrocyclization at room temperature. The described domino process complements and expands DPEX approach to a large family of fused acenes and related PAHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Synthesis of Hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines via Three&#8208;Component 1,3&#8208;Dipolar&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>

The asymmetric catalytic synthesis of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines by using a three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar&#8208;cycloaddition reaction is investigated.







Abstract
An asymmetric three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinolines, bromoacetates and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amide is realized by using a chiral N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;Y(OTf)3 complex as the catalyst. The process includes a base&#8208;promoted formation of dihydroisoquinolium ylides in&#8197;situ, and a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amides. A series of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines are obtained in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous PdNi/Ni nanoparticles assembled nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) have been synthesized via replacement reaction, in which nickel nanowires serve as sacrificial template to form tubular structure and the diblock copolymer induce the formation of mesoporous structures. Due to the mesoporous nanoparticle structure and tubular geometry, the mPdNi/Ni NTs have better catalytic performance than mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black for ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibite superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.

         <title>Ultrahigh Rate Capability and Lifespan MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF Electrode for High Performance Battery&#8208;Type Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoflower structural MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite prepared by in&#8197;situ growth of Ni&#8208;MOF on the surface of MnCo2O4 nanorods derived from Co/Mn&#8208;MOF at 600&#8201;&#176;C has a high cycling stability and outstanding rate performance as supercapacitor electrode material.







Abstract
MnCo2O4 is derived from a Co/Mn bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). Then Ni&#8208;MOF is directly grown on the surface of the obtained MnCo2O4 to form a nano&#8208;flower structure with small balls. A large surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo2O4 and porosity of Ni&#8208;MOF allow the prepared MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite material to deliver an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, an appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo2O4 precursor is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo2O4 and electrochemical performances of the resulted composite material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo2O4&#8208;600/Ni&#8208;MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance (when the current density increases from 1 to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41&#8201;%) and good cycle stability (the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74&#8201;% after 20&#8201;000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF has a good application prospect in the market.

         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300&#8197;nm) and suitable band structure was successfully synthesized, and it functioned as an efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalytst for photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines under the irradiation of white (400&#8211;830&#8197;nm), and red light (660&#8211;680&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Imines are important intermediates in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imines and has attracted great attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8211;1300&#8197;nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97&#8201;%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.

         <title>Photoinduced Water Oxidation in Chitosan Nanostructures Containing Covalently Linked RuII Chromophores and Encapsulated Iridium Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Restricted environment frees up reaction: Chitosan fibers with covalently linked RuII polypyridine complexes and encapsulated IrO2 nanoparticles exhibit a remarkable quantum yield of 0.21 for photoinduced water oxidation in sacrificial schemes. The restricted environment is held responsible for accelerating electron transfer steps, which are considered to be the basis of the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic process.







Abstract
The luminophore Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)2+ (bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; dcbpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) is covalently linked to a chitosan polymer; crosslinking by tripolyphosphate produced Ru&#8208;decorated chitosan fibers (NS&#8208;RuCh), with a 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between chitosan repeating units and RuII chromophores. The properties of the RuII compound are unperturbed by the chitosan structure, with NS&#8208;RuCh exhibiting the typical metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) absorption and emission bands of RuII complexes. When crosslinks are made in the presence of IrO2 nanoparticles, such species are encapsulated within the nanofibers, thus generating the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system, in which both RuII photosensitizers and IrO2 water oxidation catalysts are within the nanofiber structures. NS&#8208;RuCh and IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh have been characterized by dynamic light scattering, scanning electronic microscopy, and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis, which indicated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between RuII chromophores and IrO2 species. Photochemical water oxidation has been investigated by using IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh as the chromophore/catalyst assembly and persulfate anions as the sacrificial species: photochemical water oxidation yields O2 with a quantum yield (&#934;) of 0.21, definitely higher than the &#934; obtained with a similar solution containing separated Ru(bpy)32+ and IrO2 nanoparticles (0.05) or with respect to that obtained when using NS&#8208;RuCh and &#8220;free&#8221; IrO2 nanoparticles (0.10). A fast hole&#8208;scavenging process (rate constant, 7&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) involving the oxidized photosensitizer and the IrO2 catalyst within the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system is behind the improved photochemical quantum yield of IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh.

         <title>Supported CuII Single&#8208;Ion Catalyst for Total Carbon Utilization of C2 and C3 Biomass&#8208;Based Platform Molecules in the N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste not, want not: Oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based carbonyl sources such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde is catalyzed by very few CuII single sites in zeolite 5A with unprecedented 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms.







Abstract
The shift from fossil carbon sources to renewable ones is vital for developing sustainable chemical processes to produce valuable chemicals. In this work, value&#8208;added formamides were synthesized in good yields by the reaction of amines with C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based platform molecules such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. These feedstocks were selectively converted by catalysts based on Cu&#8208;containing zeolite 5A through the in&#8197;situ formation of carbonyl&#8208;containing intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which all the carbon atoms in biomass&#8208;based feedstocks could be amidated to produce formamide. Combined catalyst characterization results revealed preferably single CuII sites on the surface of Cu/5A, some of which form small clusters, but without direct linking via oxygen bridges. By combining the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin&#8208;trapping, operando attenuated total reflection (ATR) IR spectroscopy and control experiments, it was found that the formation of formamides might involve a HCOOH&#8208;like intermediate and .NHPh radicals, in which the selective formation of .OOH radicals might play a key role.

The reaction of [Mn  6  O  2  (piv)  10  (4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)  2  (pivH)  2  ] (  1  ) with  N  &#8208;methyldiethanolamine (mdeaH  2  ) and Ln(NO  3  )  3  &#183;6H  2  O in MeCN generally yields two main structure types: for Ln=Tb&#8208;Yb a previously reported Mn  5  Ln  4  motif is obtained, while for Ln=Pr&#8208;Eu a series of Mn  7  Ln  3  clusters is obtained. Within this series the Gd  III  analogue represents a special case since it shows both structural types as well as a third Mn  2  Ln  2  inverse butterfly motif. Variation in reaction conditions allows access to different structure types across the whole series. This prompts further studies into the reaction mechanism of this cluster assisted self&#8208;assembly approach. For the Mn  7  Ln  3  analogues reported here variable&#8208;temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin carriers are dominant. Compounds incorporating Ln=Nd  III  (  2  ), Sm  III  (  3  ) and Gd  III  (  5  ) display SMM behaviour. The slow relaxation of the magnetization for these compounds was confirmed by ac measurements above 1.8 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Determination of Relative Stabilities of Metal&#8208;Peptide Bonds in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding binding site preferences in biological systems as well as affinities to binding partners is a crucial aspect in metallodrug development. We here present a mass spectrometrybased method to compare relative stabilities of metal&#8208;peptide adducts in the gas phase. Angiotensin 1 and substance P were used as model peptides. Incubation with isostructural N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of Ru II , Os II , Rh III , and Ir III led to the formation of various adducts, which were subsequently studied by energy&#8208;resolved fragmentation experiments. The gas phase stability of the metalpeptide bonds depended on the metal and the binding partner. Of the four complexes used, the Os II derivative binds strongest to Met, while Ru II forms the most stable coordination bond with His. Rh III was identified as the weakest peptide binder and Ir III formed peptide adducts with intermediate stability. Probing these intrinsic gas phase properties can help in the interpretation of biological activities and the design of site&#8208;specific protein binding metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a Red&#8208;Emitting Viscosity Sensitive BODIPY Fluorophore for Intracellular Viscosity Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viscosity imaging at a microscopic scale can provide important information about biosystems, including the development of serious illnesses. Microviscosity imaging is achievable with viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores, the most popular of which are based on the BODIPY group. However, most of the BODIPY probes fluoresce green light, whereas the red luminescence is desired for the imaging of biological samples. Designing a new viscosity probe with suitable spectroscopic properties is a challenging task because it is difficult to preserve viscosity sensitivity after modifying the molecular structure. Here we describe how we developed a new red&#8208;emitting, viscosity sensitive, BODIPY fluorophore BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 that is suitable for reliable intracellular viscosity imaging of lipid droplets in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. The design of BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 was aided by DFT calculations that allowed a successful prediction of the viscosity sensitivity of fluorophores before synthesis. In summary, we report a new red viscosity probe possessing monoexponential fluorescence decay that makes it attractive for lifetime&#8208;based viscosity imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2](P2BCy4  =&#160;1,2&#8208;  bis  (di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane)is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron&#160;k1  &#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the&#160;P  2  B  Cy  4  secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)  8  ] with PhI provides [Ni  II  (P  2  B  Cy  4  )  2  (DMAP)  8  (I)]I  via  iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and&#160;  not  a [Ni  II  (Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an interesting secondary sphere effect. Last, the reactivity of [Ni  0  (P  2  B  Cy  4  )  2  ] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (  2  ) and trimer (  3  ) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in  2  adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore,  3  forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that  2  has a larger strain energy than  3  owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH  2  Cl  2  solution. The spectra of both  2  and  3  are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety. These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (  &#981;  = 0.70&#8211;0.82) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|  g  CPL  | = 1.6 &#215; 10  &#8211;3  ) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Chemoselectivity of Reactive Intermediates Formation and Their Direct Use in a Flow Microreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a chemoselectivity switchable flowmicro reaction to generate reactive and unstable intermediates. The switchable chemoselectivity of this reaction enables a selection for one of two different intermediates, an aryllithium or a benzyl lithium, at will from the same starting material. Starting from bromo&#8208;substituted styrenes, the aryllithium intermediates were converted to the substituted styrenes, whereas the benzyl lithium intermediates were engaged in an anionic polymerization. These chemoselectivity&#8208;switchable reactions can be integrated to produce polymers that cannot be formed during typical polymerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Oligomers Containing Main&#8208;Chain B(sp2)&#8208;B(sp2) Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) are prepared by salt metathesis, and the appended alkynyl groups are subjected to hydroboration. Their reactions with monohydroboranes lead to discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species, while dihydroboranes induce their catenation to oligomeric species, the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with B&#8211;B bonds. The oligomeric species were found to comprise 4&#8208;19 repeat units and are soluble in common organic solvents. Some of the oligomeric species have good air stability and all were characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene (C60) Microstructures Featuring Surface Cracks with Enhanced Photoluminescence and Microscopic Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface cracks could improve the optical and photoelectronic properties of crystalline materials due to the increased specific surface area, but controlled self&#8208;assembly of fullerene (C60) molecules into micro&#8208;/nanostructures with surface cracks is still challenging. Herein, we report the morphology engineering of novel C60 microstructures bearing surface cracks for the first time, selecting phenetole and n&#8208;propanol (NPA) as the good and poor solvents, respectively. Our systematic investigations reveal that phenetole molecules initially participate in the formation of the ends of the C60 microstructures, and then NPA molecules are involved in the gradual growth of the sidewalls of the microstructures. Therefore, the surface cracks of C60 microstructures can be finely regulated by adjusting the addition of NPA and the crystallization time. Interestingly, the cracked C60 microstructures show superior photoluminescence properties relative to the smooth microstructures due to the increased specific surface area. Besides, C60 microstructures with wide cracks show preferential recognition of silica particles over C60 particles owing to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged C60 microstructures and the positively charged silica microparticles. Our work introduces surface cracks into C60 crystals for the first time, demonstrating their potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Local field induced mass transfer: New insight in nano&#8208;electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unravelling complex kinetics of electrocatalysis is essential for the design of electrocatalysts with high performance. Mass transfer and electron transfer are two primary factors need to be optimized in order to enhance electrocatalytic reaction. Utilization of nano&#8208;catalysts proves to be promising ways promoting performance of electrocatalytic reactions, which is usually attributed to their ability of enhancing the electron transfer. However, when catalysts downsize to the nanoscale, their size is comparable to the thickness of electrical double layer, so that curvatures of nano&#8208;catalysts may lead to inhomogeneous local electric field on the electrode, which then changes essentially the mass transfer. In this review, we introduce the new concept of local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer in nano&#8208;electrocatalytic systems, and provide a brief review of recent progresses revealing its effect on nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, which may bring new insight in future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Propensity in Solution: Direct Observation and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind  coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind  accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.</dc:description>

         <title>Study of the cycloaddition of CO2 with styrene oxide over 6&#8208;connected spn topology MOFs (Zr, Hf) at room temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a series of MOFs with a 6&#8208;connected spn topology (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(Zr, Hf), PCN&#8208;777&#8208;(Zr, Hf), MOF&#8208;818&#8208;(Zr, Hf)). Through the in&#8208;situ DRIFTS of NH  3  &#160;adsorption&#8208;desorption, we found that the activated catalyst mainly contains Lewis acid sites. The effects of different organic ligands on the Lewis acid of the Zr  6  &#160;cluster were analyzed by XPS and NH  3  &#8208;TPD, and the relative Lewis acidity of the same metal was obtained: PCN&#8208;777&gt;MOF&#8208;808&gt;MOF&#8208;818.&#160;In the Py&#8208;FTIR results, we confirmed that MOF&#8208;818 has a higher acid site density. In the activity test, MOFs with mesoporous structure showed better catalytic activity under normal temperature and pressure. Among them, MOF&#8208;818 can still maintain a high degree of crystallinity after catalysis. Finally, we use density functional theory to propose the mechanism of the cycloaddition reaction of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. The results show that the metal is coordinated with styrene oxide and halogens attack the &#946; carbon of the epoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named  1a  , is reported. Complex  1a  low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H  2  elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol-containing compounds widely distributed in non-tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)-hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named  1a  , is reported. Complex  1a  low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H  2  elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD-DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two-photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating Inner Workings of Naturally Sourced Organic Optoelectronic Materials with Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in sustainable optoelectronics including photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, transistors, and semiconductors have been enabled by &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules. A fundamental understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions involving these materials can be realized by time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies. In this Minireview, the photoinduced mechanisms including charge/energy transfer, electronic (de)localization, and excited&#8208;state proton transfer are correlated with functional properties encompassing optical absorption, fluorescence quantum yield, conductivity, and photostability. Four naturally derived molecules (xylindein, dimethylxylindein, alizarin, indigo) with ultrafast spectral insights showcase efficient energy dissipation involving H&#8208;bonding networks and proton motions, which yield high photostability. Rational design principles derived from such investigations could increase the efficiency for light harvesting, triplet formation, and photosensitivity for improved and versatile optoelectronic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type Oxidation of Olefins to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron complex FePcF16 was recently shown to convert olefins into ketones in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of triethylsilane in ethanol at room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere. Herein, we describe an extensive mechanistic investigation for the conversion of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene into 2&#8208;acetylnaphthalene as model reaction. A variety of studies including deuterium&#8208; and 18O2&#8208;labeling experiments, ESI&#8208;MS, and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy have been performed to identify the intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle of the oxidation process. Finally, a detailed and well&#8208;supported reaction mechanism for the FePcF16&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type oxidation has been proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Patterns of Aryl&#8208;Group Substituted Silanediols and &#8208;triols from Alkoxy&#8208; and Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilanols typically show a high condensation tendency and only exist as stable isolable molecules under very specific steric and electronic conditions at the silicon atom. In the present work, various novel representatives of this class of compounds were synthesized by hydrolysis of alkoxy&#8208; or chlorosilanes. Phenyl, 1&#8209;naphthyl, and 9&#8209;phenanthrenyl substituents at the silicon atom were applied to systematically study the influence of the aromatic substituents on the structure and reactivity of the compounds. Chemical shifts in 29Si NMR spectroscopy in solution, correlated well with the expected electronic situation induced by the substitution pattern on the Si atom. 1H&#160;NMR studies allowed the detection of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the alkoxides and the chlorosilanes are dominated by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of the aromatic systems, which are substituted by strong hydrogen bonding interactions representing various structural motifs in the respective organosilanol structures.</dc:description>

Energy decomposition analysis indicates that the encapsulation is the main responsible for most of the energy barrier reduction.&#160; Microsolvation and encapsulation effects are not equally contributing for both metal systems and consequently, the reasons of the rate acceleration are not the same for both metallic systems despite the similarity between them.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphosphino&#8208;Functionalized 1,8&#8208;Naphthyridines: a Multifaceted Ligand Platform for Boranes and Diboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine diphosphine (NDP) reacts with boroncontaining Lewis acids to generate complexes featuring a number of different naphthyridine bonding modes. When exposed to diborane B  2  Br  4  , NDP underwent self&#8208;deprotonation to afford [NDP&#8208;B  2  Br  3  ]Br, an unsymmetrical diborane comprised of four fused rings. The reaction of two equivalents of monoborane BBr  3  and NDP in a non&#8208;polar solvent provided the simple phosphine&#8208;borane adduct NDP(BBr  3  )  2  , which then underwent intramolecular halide abstraction to furnish the salt [NDP&#8208;BBr  2  ][BBr  4  ], featuring a different coordination mode from that of [NDP&#8208;B  2  Br  3  ]Br. Direct deprotonation of NDP by KHMDS or PhCH  2  K generates mono&#8208; and dipotassium reagents, respectively. The monopotassium reagent reacts with one or half an equivalent of B  2  (NMe  2  )  2  Cl  2  to afford NDP&#8208;based diboranes with three or four amino substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching the Mechanism of NADH Photooxidation by Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of three Ru(II) polypyridine complexes was investigated for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)  +  in water. A combination of (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic studies and photocatalysis experiments revealed that ligand design can be used to control the mechanism of the photooxidation: For prototypical Ru(II) complexes a  1  O  2  pathway was found.  Rudppz  ([(tbbpy)  2  Ru(dppz)]Cl  2  , tbbpy = 4,4&#180;&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz = dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine), instead, initiated the cofactor oxidation by electron transfer from NAD(P)H enabled by supramolecular binding between substrate and catalyst. Expulsion of the photoproduct NAD(P)  +  from the supramolecular binding site in  Rudppz  allowed very efficient turnover. Therefore,  Rudppz  permits repetitive selective assembly and oxidative conversion of reduced naturally occurring nicotinamides by recognizing the redox state of the cofactor under formation of H  2  O  2  as additional product. This photocatalytic process can fuel discontinuous photobiocatalysis.</dc:description>

Rudppz  ([(tbbpy)  2  Ru(dppz)]Cl  2  , tbbpy = 4,4&#180;-di-  tert  -butyl-2,2&#180;-bipyridine, dppz = dipyrido[3,2-a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-c]phenazine), instead, initiated the cofactor oxidation by electron transfer from NAD(P)H enabled by supramolecular binding between substrate and catalyst. Expulsion of the photoproduct NAD(P)  +  from the supramolecular binding site in  Rudppz  allowed very efficient turnover. Therefore,  Rudppz  permits repetitive selective assembly and oxidative conversion of reduced naturally occurring nicotinamides by recognizing the redox state of the cofactor under formation of H  2  O  2  as additional product. This photocatalytic process can fuel discontinuous photobiocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The carboarylation reaction of biphenyl&#8208;alkynes was successfully triggered by electrophilic attack of 1,1&#8208;bis(triflyl)ethylene on the alkyne moiety to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decorated by superacidic carbon acid functionality. Neutralisation of thus obtained acids with NaHCO  3  yielded the corresponding sodium salts, which showed improved solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Mirror symmetry breaking and network formation in achiral polycatenars with thioether tail</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mirror symmetry breaking in systems composed of achiral molecules is of importance for the design of functional materials for technological applications as well as for the understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous emergence of chirality. Herein, we report the design and molecular self&#8208;assembly of two series of rod&#8208;like achiral polycatenar molecules derived from a &#960;&#8208;conjugated 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene core with a fork&#8208;like triple alkoxylated end and a variable single alkylthio chain at the other end. In both series of liquid crystalline materials, differing in the chain length at the trialkoxylated end, helical self&#8208;assembly of the  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated rods in networks occurs, leading to wide temperature range (&gt; 200 K) of bicontinuous cubic network phases, in some cases being stable even around ambient temperatures. The achiral bicontinuous cubic  I  a3  d  phase (gyroid) is replaced upon alkylthio chain elongation by a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken bicontinuous cubic phase (  I  23) and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso  1  [  *  ]  ). Further chain elongation results in removing the  I  23 phase and the re&#8208;appearance of the  Ia3  d  phase with &#160;different pitch lengths. In the second series an additional tetragonal phase separates the two cubic phase types.</dc:description>
