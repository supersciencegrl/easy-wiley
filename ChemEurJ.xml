         <title>Stereospecific on&#8208;Surface Cyclodehydrogenation of Bishelicenes: Preservation of Handedness from Helical to Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flattening helices while keeping the handedness: On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of bishelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically to (M,M) and (P,P) chiral planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This is followed by their homochiral aggregation into a 2D conglomerate. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds stereospecifically to chiral, planar coronocoronene. Such a reaction is a special example of topochemistry in which enantiospecific conversion is supported by the alignment of the reactant by the surface.

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable? The activity and functional group tolerance of metal alkylidyne canopy catalysts for alkyne metathesis is excellent, but their stability leaves room for optimization. The search for the Achilles&#8242; heels unveiled a new decomposition pathway through bimolecular coupling and led to the discovery of a facile cyclo&#8208;tetramerization reaction by (reversible) opening of the tripodal ligand cage.







Abstract
Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex 1&#8201;a endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is the most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway that engages the Mo&#8801;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple&#8208;bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#8801;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex, 8, with a Mo&#8801;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques, 95Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex 6, endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework, is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining visible light and passing DC current through a carbon nitride material doped with copper atoms catalyzes the selective reduction of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to an important chemical intermediate, carbon monoxide. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to show how visible light increases the current and activity of the material. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101820).

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is one of the unresolved issues of prebiotic chemistry. Why are the amino acids found in proteins of the l configuration? Perhaps peptido nucleotides could have played a role as transitional species, as suggested visually by the Archaeopteryx in the image. It was recently shown that these phosphoramidate&#8208;linked species form spontaneously from simple precursors. Now, the diastereoselectivity of the the dipeptide&#8208;forming step has been determined by in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy, revealing that homochiral products are preferred. This is reported in the Full Paper by C. Richert et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101630).

A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) for the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamides is reported. The six&#8208;membered cyclic sulfamide products can be easily converted into a variety of useful 1,3&#8208;diamines. The present amination that effectively proceeds under ambient conditions, features operationally simple, practical, and scalable methodology.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diamines are an important class of compounds that are broadly found in natural products and are also widely used as building blocks in organic synthesis. Although the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamide derivatives is a reliable method for the construction of 1,3&#8208;diamine structures, the majority of these methods involve the use of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst. We herein report on a new transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS), enabling secondary non&#8208;benzylic and tertiary C&#8722;H amination reactions to proceed. The cyclic sulfamide products can be easily transformed into 1,3&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that amination reactions using t&#8208;BuOI or NIS each proceed via different pathways.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;symmetry organometallic sandwiches of lanthanides are of current high interest because of their magnetic and optical properties. When trivalent lanthanide complexes feature the large monoanionic cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligand, an interesting hapticity switching is observed along with a decrease in the size of the metal center. This cover shows the structural evolution from the terbium to the lutecium metal ion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;W. Roesky, G. Nocton, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101599).

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest applications of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with multifunctional nanomaterials in tumor treatment are summarized. Nanomaterials with different characteristics can optimize the Fenton reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction to make CDT produce distinctive enhancement effects. The combination of nanomaterials, CDT and various other therapies would promote the multi&#8208;functionalization of the treatment system, thereby enhancing the anticancer effect.







Abstract
During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to summarize the recent advances comprehensively and systematically in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.

         <title>Target&#8208;Dependent Protection of DNA Aptamers Against Nucleolytic Digestion Enables Signal&#8208;On Biosensing with Toehold&#8208;Mediated Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5 &#162; &#8208;end protects it from 3 &#162; &#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn&#8208;on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real&#8208;time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay,</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido&#8208;Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8722; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12310-12319, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of isomorphous lanthanide Gd to Er complexes containing the tetraimido sulfate ligand renders these compounds compelling to be investigated for their single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The displayed Dy dimer shows slow magnetic relaxation at zero field. The monomeric Tb and Dy complexes show field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The ligand holds great potential for higher blocking systems, that is, removal of chloride ions, lithium transmetalation and promotion of the magnetic communication between the metal ions.







Abstract
Lanthanide ions are particularly well&#8208;suited for the design of single&#8208;molecule magnets owing to their large unquenched orbital angular momentum and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling that gives rise to high magnetic anisotropy. Such nanoscopic bar magnets can potentially revolutionize high&#8208;density information storage and processing technologies, if blocking temperatures can be increased substantially. Exploring non&#8208;classical ligand scaffolds with the aim to boost the barriers to spin&#8208;relaxation are prerequisite. Here, the synthesis, crystallographic and magnetic characterization of a series of each isomorphous mono&#8208; and dinuclear lanthanide (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) complexes comprising tetraimido sulfate ligands are presented. The dinuclear Dy complex [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2DyCl2}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClLi(thf)2] (1c) shows true signatures of single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior in the absence of a dc field. In addition, the mononuclear Dy and Tb complexes [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2LnCl2(thf)2] (2b,c) show slow magnetic relaxation under applied dc fields.

         <title>Polymerization of Allenes by Using an Iron(II) &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Pre&#8208;Catalyst to Generate High Mn Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12335-12340, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare example of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of aryl allenes is presented. Reactions are mild and generate very high Mn polymers with narrow polydispersity by using a well&#8208;defined Fe(II) pre&#8208;catalyst and a hydride additive. [2+2] cycloaddition to form cyclobutanes is also viable using the same catalytic system.







Abstract
Herein, we report an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co&#8208;catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to Mn=189 000&#8197;Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically, we postulate that the co&#8208;catalyst does not react to form an iron(II) hydride in&#8197;situ, but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclobutane side&#8208;product is also investigated.

&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; polymers with narrow polydispersity by using a well-defined Fe(II) pre-catalyst and a hydride additive. [2+2] cycloaddition to form cyclobutanes is also viable using the same catalytic system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report an iron(II)-catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co-catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=189 000&#8197;Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically, we postulate that the co-catalyst does not react to form an iron(II) hydride in&#8197;situ, but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3-substituted cyclobutane side-product is also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>(NH4)2V7O16 Microbricks as a Novel Anode for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with Good Cyclability</title>

Recharging your batteries: Brick&#8208;like (NH4)2V7O16, which features an open&#8208;layered structure with two NH4+ ions residing in the V7O16 layers, undergoes ammonium ion extraction and insertion processes during cycling. Two novel full cell systems, (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 and (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 (shown), both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance, thus suggesting that the layered (NH4)2V7O16 could be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Searching for novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH4)2V7O16 with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li+/Na+ hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 and (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. A capacity retention of 78.61&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 was demonstrated in the (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 system, whereas no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH4)2V7O16 electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells were also researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that layered (NH4)2V7O16 can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12395-12409, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial structures of the active complex of midkine and synthetic chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides have been solved by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The rigid ligand is enclosed by a flexible receptor, with an intrinsically disordered region. The 3D structure of the ligands remains as a helical, almost lineal structure, independently of the aromatic substituents introduced.







Abstract
Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells.

The importance of connections: The photoactivity of dihydroazulene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;dihydroazulene (DHA&#8208;AZB&#8208;DHA) triad photoswitches depends strongly on the para/meta connectivity at the central azobenzene unit. The synthesis and switching properties of two triad systems are presented here. The meta connectivity allowed reversible photo&#8208;/thermoswitching between DHA&#8208;trans&#8208;AZB&#8208;DHA and VHF&#8208;cis&#8208;AZB&#8208;VHF where VHF is the vinylheptafulvene photoisomer of DHA. Ultrafast spectroscopy revealed the DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization to be faster than the trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis AZB photoisomerization.







Abstract
Photoswitch triads comprising two dihydroazulene (DHA) units in conjugation with a central trans&#8208;azobenzene (AZB) unit were prepared in stepwise protocols starting from meta&#8208; and para&#8208;disubstituted azobenzenes. The para&#8208;connected triad had significantly altered optical properties and lacked the photoactivity of the separate photochromes. In contrast, for the meta&#8208;connected triad, all three photochromes could be photoisomerized to generate an isomer with two vinylheptafulvene (VHF) units and a cis&#8208;azobenzene unit. Ultrafast spectroscopy of the photoisomerizations revealed a fast DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization and a slower trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis AZB photoisomerization. This meta triad underwent thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;conversion with a similar rate of all VHFs, independent of the identity of the neighboring units, and in parallel thermal cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans AZB conversion. The experimental observations were supported by computation (excitation spectra and orbital analysis of the transitions).

         <title>Synthesis and Absorption Properties of Long Acenoacenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes was developed. The presented strategy is general enough to be employed also for the construction of substituted analogues and potentially their heteroanalogues. The structure of these acenoacenes represent, in fact, formal stitching of two acene units that share one double bond in the final product. This angular topology significantly improves their stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts.







Abstract
Acenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings have received immense attention due to their performance as semiconductors in organic optoelectronic applications. Their appealing physicochemical properties, such as extended delocalization, high charge carrier mobilities, narrow HOMO&#8208;LOMO gaps and partially radical character in the ground state make them very attractive targets for many potential applications. However, the intrinsic synthetic challenges of unsubstituted members such as high reactivity and poor solubility are still limiting factors for their wider exploitation. Herein, we report a simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes with improved stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts. The synthesis and comprehensive characterization of pentacenopentacene, pentacenohexacene and hexacenohexacene, with lengths between decacene and dodecacene, are disclosed.

A versatile method is presented for the direct N&#8208;arylation of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) providing a variety of functionalized derivatives.

Investigations on optical and redox properties led to valuable structure&#8208;property relationships. Further functionalization of an acceptor&#8208;substituted DTP yielded cruciform&#8208;type donor&#8722;acceptor oligomers, which were implemented into single material organic solar cells.







Abstract
A novel and versatile method for the N&#8208;arylation of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is presented. By Pd&#8208; or Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling a variety of arenes and acenes were directly attached at the DTP&#8722;nitrogen yielding a variety of functionalized DTPs. Investigations on optical and redox properties led to valuable structure&#8208;property relationships, which were corroborated by quantum chemical calculations. Further functionalization and elongation of the conjugation of an acceptor&#8208;substituted DTP was elaborated to result in complex cruciform&#8208;type donor&#8722;acceptor oligomers, which were investigated and implemented in single material organic solar cells.

         <title>Structural Transformation of Surface&#8208;Confined Porphyrin Networks by Addition of Co Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12430-12436, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural transformation of a porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional network from its H&#8208;bonded phase to a porous metal&#8208;coordinated phase after the addition of Co&#8208;atoms on Au(111) under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions was inverstigated. The networks were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy, low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a nickel&#8208;porphyrin derivative (Ni&#8208;DPPyP) containing two pyridyl coordinating sites and two pentyl chains at trans meso positions was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) on Au(111). Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl's nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423&#8197;K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.

         <title>Ionization and Photofragmentation of Isolated Metalloporphyrin Cations Investigated by VUV Action Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12371-12379, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated metalloporphyrin cations FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+ have been studied in the gas phase by action spectroscopy in the vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) range using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and synchrotron radiation. The ionization energy of each compound has been measured. Photoexcitation and photoionization lead to strikingly different fragmentation pathways. Evidence for non&#8208;statistical dissociation processes including water losses were identified. Fragment assignments have been supported by additional high&#8208;resolution collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments on a hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbital mass spectrometer.







Abstract
We investigated the photoionization and fragmentation of isolated metal protoporphyrin IX cations (MPPIX+ with M=Fe, Co, Zn) by means of vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) action spectroscopy in the energy range of 8.5&#8211;35&#8197;eV. Experiments were carried out in the gas phase by interfacing an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer with a synchrotron beamline. The mass spectra and partial ion yields show that photoexcitation of the precursor ions predominantly leads to .CH2COOH radical side&#8208;chain losses of the macrocycle with additional methyl radical (.CH3) side&#8208;chain losses. Ionization, in contrast, leads to the formation of the intact ionized precursor and various doubly charged fragments which are mostly due to side&#8208;chain cleavages. Although statistical fragmentation dominates, we found evidence for non&#8208;statistical processes such as new fragments involving for example single and double H2O losses, indicating that different relaxation mechanisms are at play upon photoionization compared to photoexcitation. The measured ionization energies were 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV, 9.4&#177;0.2&#8197;eV and 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV for FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+, respectively.

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12352-12361, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbanion cartography: This study maps the stability/reactivity space for &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions leading to the prediction of novel species. Free carbanionic intermediates can be described as borata&#8208;alkene species with a C&#8722;B &#960;&#8208;interaction strongly polarized towards the carbon, whereas multi&#8208;boryl species have very polar C&#8722;B bonds. Extensive analysis of &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors identifies three structural patterns that can be related to reactivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions shows remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tuning its reactivity. Here, the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions are described. DFT&#8208;derived parameters were used to capture their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carbanion cartography&lt;/b&gt;: This study maps the stability/reactivity space for &#945;-boryl carbanions leading to the prediction of novel species. Free carbanionic intermediates can be described as borata-alkene species with a C&#8722;B &#960;-interaction strongly polarized towards the carbon, whereas multi-boryl species have very polar C&#8722;B bonds. Extensive analysis of &#945;-boryl alkylidene metal precursors identifies three structural patterns that can be related to reactivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of stabilized &#945;-boryl carbanions shows remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. The electron-deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tuning its reactivity. Here, the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;-boryl carbanions are described. DFT-derived parameters were used to capture their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic center, the number of &#945;-boryl motifs, and the metal counterion. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata-alkene species with C&#8722;B &#960; interactions polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, it was possible to classify the &#945;-boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1)&#8197;nucleophilic borata-alkene salts with alkali and alkaline earth metals, 2)&#8197;nucleophilic &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

Blue emissive materials: boron containing fluorescent compounds have been prepared starting from imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine phenols. Large Stokes shift, high absolute quantum yields and good photostability are observed in solution. TD&#8208;DFT calculations allowed to find a linear correlation between the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of these compounds and the Hammett constants of substituents R para to the hydroxyl group of the phenols.







Abstract
Several boron compounds with 2&#8208;(imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols, differentiated by the nature of the substituent (R) in the para position of the hydroxy group, have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized both in solution (1H, 13C, 11B, 19F NMR) and in the solid state (X&#8208;ray). All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations allowed to define the main electronic transitions as intra ligand transitions (1ILT), which was corroborated by the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) shapes. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap was correlated to the electronic properties of the substituent R on the phenolic ring, as quantified by its &#963;p Hammett constant.

         <title>Factors Controlling the Aluminum(I)&#8208;meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation in Arenes</title>

The factors controlling the so&#8208;far poorly understood complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by different aluminyl anions are revealed by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods.







Abstract
The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, namely the activation strain model of reactivity and energy decomposition analysis, has been applied to quantitatively unveil the origin of the selectivity of the transformation as well as the influence of the associated potassium cation. It is found that the selectivity takes place during the initial nucleophilic addition step where the key LP(Al)&#8594;&#960;*(C=C) molecular orbital interaction is more stabilizing for the meta&#8208;pathway, which results in a stronger interaction between the reactants along the entire transformation.

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132} Cluster Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12327-12334, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral resolution of racemic amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) has been achieved by using a chirally coordinated enantiopure polyoxometalate host, {Mo132(lactate)30}. NMR spectroscopic methods, including DOSY measurements, were applied to determine the enantiomeric excesses of guest mixtures in addition to the association constants of the host&#8208;guest system binding process.







Abstract
Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents interact noncovalently with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy; this is then reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules has been synthesised. By exploiting the interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores, the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent was establish and their enantiomeric excess was determined by 1H NMR using shifts of &#916;&#916;&#948;=0.06&#8197;ppm. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of a class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.

         <title>Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations: Synthetic Studies on Pimarane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12410-12421, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of pimaranes is based on two consecutive cyclization reactions of the linear polyene geranylgeranyl diphosphate. In contrast, our synthetic studies on pimaranes involve a tetracyclization reaction of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether. The modified isoprene enabled a transannular endo&#8208;termination step and rapid assembly of the natural product pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;diol.







Abstract
Polyene cyclizations generate molecular complexity from a linear polyene in a single step. While methods to initiate these cyclizations have been continuously expanded and improved over the years, the majority of polyene substrates are still limited to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes. In this study, we took advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized bifunctional alkenes. The realization of a polyene tetracyclization of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether involving a transannular endo&#8208;termination step enabled the total synthesis of the tricyclic diterpenoid pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;diol. The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic nor&#8208;diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.

The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic &lt;i&gt;nor&lt;/i&gt;-diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12320-12326, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni(II)&#8208;allyl complexes supported by bulky terphenyl phosphine ligands have been prepared and characterized. These complexes have been used as precatalysts in the formation of C&#8722;S bonds, allowing the efficient coupling between a variety of electrophiles, including aryl chlorides and, for the first time, tosylates, with aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Moreover, differentiated reactivity of the electrophilic partners enables tandem formation of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds in a single step.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have received less attention compared with other C&#8208;heteroatom couplings. Most reported examples comprise the thioetherification of most reactive aryl iodides with aromatic thiols. The use of C&#8722;O electrophiles in this context is almost uncharted. Here, we describe that preformed Ni(II) precatalysts of the type NiCl(allyl)(PMe2Ar&#8217;) (Ar&#8217;=terphenyl group) efficiently couple a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides, including challenging aryl chlorides, with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Aryl and alkenyl tosylates are also well tolerated, demonstrating, for the first time, to be competent electrophilic partners in Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S bond formation. The chemoselective functionalization of the C&#8722;I bond in the presence of a C&#8722;Cl bond allows for designing site&#8208;selective tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N couplings. The formation of the two C&#8208;heteroatom bonds takes place in a single operation and represents a rare example of dual electrophile/nucleophile chemoselective process.

Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have great potential application in a range of pioneering areas, such as quantum computing, spintronics, and high&#8208;density information storage. The properties of the molecules presented here are based on the molecular total spin and the magnetic anisotropy created by the lanthanides in a particular crystal field. An important element in SMMs&#8217; optimization is the ligand design. Poly imido sulfur ligands are perfectly suited as the polar S+&#8722;N&#8722;&#8208;bond facilitates electronic and geometric adaptability to various f&#8208;metals. Particularly the acute N&#8211;Dy&#8211;N bite angle generates advantageous magnetic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Demir, D. Stalke et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts with unique electronic structures and irreplaceable comprehensive properties play crucial roles in electrocatalysis. Anion engineering can create a series of PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) that provide a promising prospect for improving the electrocatalytic performance and use of Pt&#8208;group noble metals. This review seeks the electrochemical activity origin of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds, and systematically analyzes and summarizes their synthetic strategies and energy&#8208;relevant applications in electrocatalysis. For more information, see the Mini Review on p.&#8197;12257&#8201;ff.

In a cooperative effort between research groups from Dortmund (Germany, coat of arms on the left) and Cuernavaca (Morelos, M&#233;xico, coat of arms on the right), novel molecular cages were synthesized and characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art analytical methods and DFT calculations. Among these novel compounds, the spacer&#8208;bridged tetraorganodistannoxane in the centre showing a double&#8208;ladder structure exhibits a record spacing between the opposite tin centres. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Jurkschat, H. H&#246;pfl, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101055).

Greatness in simplicity: A general, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be used to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on a gram scale with both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed some of its unique chemical properties. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Wang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102369).

Energy efficiency and electrocatalysts: Modulating Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, which can effectively improve the PGM compounds&#8242; activity and reduce the use of noble metals. This review looks at the origin of the electrochemical activity of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds and systematically summarizes the progress of their synthetic strategies and applications in energy&#8208;relevant electrocatalysis to date.







Abstract
Pt&#8208;group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts with unique electronic structures and irreplaceable comprehensive properties play crucial roles in electrocatalysis. Anion engineering can create a series of PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) that provide a promising prospect for improving the electrocatalytic performance and use of Pt&#8208;group noble metals. This review seeks the electrochemical activity origin of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds, and systematically analyzes and summarizes their synthetic strategies and energy&#8208;relevant applications in electrocatalysis. Orientation towards the sustainable development of nonfossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion&#8208;modulated strategy for Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy a future green electrochemical energy conversion system. Based on the previous work of our group and others, this review summarizes the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) in energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis from the origin of their activity and synthetic strategies to electrochemical applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, the key problems, countermeasures and future development orientations of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds toward electrocatalytic applications are proposed.

Various Si/C materials by different synthetic methods are reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by Si and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of Si are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li2TiO3 materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, become a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon&#8208;based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.

         <title>Molecular Cage Assembly by Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn Bridging of Di&#8208;, Tri&#8208; and Tetranuclear Organotin Tectons: Extending the Spacing in Double Ladder Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12276-12283, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an alternative approach to metal&#8208;containing cage assemblies, air&#8208;stable di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetranuclear organotin compounds were explored in a combined experimental and theoretical approach for the synthesis of hexa&#8208; and octanuclear metal cages based on halide&#8208;oxide (hydrolysis) reactions at the metal centres. Among these, there are two novel bis(tetraorganodistannoxanes) showing double&#8208;ladder&#8208;type structures with record of head&#8208;to&#8208;toe dimensions. From this contribution, multiple options for future development in different directions arise.







Abstract
Hydrolysis reactions of di&#8208; and trinuclear organotin halides yielded large novel cage compounds containing Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn bridges. The molecular structures of two octanuclear tetraorganodistannoxanes showing double&#8208;ladder motifs, viz., [{Me3SiCH2(Cl)SnCH2YCH2Sn(OH)CH2SiMe3}2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]2 [1, Y=p&#8208;(Me)2SiC6H4&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2] and [{Me3SiCH2(I)SnCH2YCH2Sn(OH)CH2SiMe3}2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2 [2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2, Y=p&#8208;(Me)2SiC6H4&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2], and the hexanuclear cage&#8208;compound 1,3,6&#8208;C6H3(p&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2CH2Sn(R)2OSn(R)2CH2Si(Me)2C6H4&#8208;p)3C6H3&#8208;1,3,6 (3, R=CH2SiMe3) are reported. Of these, the co&#8208;crystal 2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2 exhibits the largest spacing of 16.7&#8197;&#197; reported to date for distannoxane&#8208;based double ladders. DFT calculations for the hexanuclear cage and a related octanuclear congener accompany the experimental work.

     alt="Molecular Cage Assembly by Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn Bridging of Di-, Tri- and Tetranuclear Organotin Tectons: Extending the Spacing in Double Ladder Structures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In an alternative&lt;/b&gt; approach to metal-containing cage assemblies, air-stable di-, tri- and tetranuclear organotin compounds were explored in a combined experimental and theoretical approach for the synthesis of hexa- and octanuclear metal cages based on halide-oxide (hydrolysis) reactions at the metal centres. Among these, there are two novel bis(tetraorganodistannoxanes) showing double-ladder-type structures with record of head-to-toe dimensions. From this contribution, multiple options for future development in different directions arise.

         <title>Cata&#8208;Annulated Azaacene Bisimides</title>

How high can you go? Cata&#8208;annulation of dicarboximides onto azaacenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and increases reduction potentials up to &#8722;0.35&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+, but does not stabilize a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene which dimerized regioselectively to its butterfly adduct.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient azaacenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes with chlorinated mellophanic diimide followed by oxidation of the intermediate N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydro compounds with MnO2 or PbO2. The resulting cata&#8208;annulated bisimide azaacenes have ultrahigh electron affinities with first reduction potentials as low as &#8722;0.35&#8197;V recorded for a tetraazapentacene. Attempts to prepare a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene resulted in the formation of a symmetric butterfly dimer.

         <title>General, Straightforward, and Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Vinyl Triflimides</title>

         <dc:description>
Greatness in simplicity: A general, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be utilized to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on gram scale using both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed part of its unique chemical properties.







Abstract
Vinyl triflimides were only accessible recently and their chemistry is yet to be discovered. Herein, we describe a general, straightforward and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of these materials from alkynes and triflimide. A vast array of terminal and internal alkynes with broad spectrum of functionalities could be employed to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides regiospecifically with high to specific stereoselectivity. Moreover, the protocol could be conducted on gram scale using terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides revealed part of its chemical properties.

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12289-12293, August 25, 2021. </description>

A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a disulphide bond to obtain a redox&#8208;responsive contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that can be used to label the lumen of alginate&#8208;based cell embedding capsules. The increase of reducing potential within the capsule microenvironment, that is related to hypoxia, can be readily detected by a decrease of MRI contrast enhancement.







Abstract
One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T1&#8208;weighted MR images.

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>

RNA editing: Site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing was engineered to be under control of the plant hormone gibberellic acid, applying the mechanism of chemically induced dimerization. Tight control and editing yields up to 44&#8201;% where achieved on endogenous targets in human cell culture.







Abstract
Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20&#8201;% and 44&#8201;% in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease&#8208;relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42&#8201;%.

     alt="Controlling Site-Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RNA editing&lt;/b&gt;: Site-directed adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing was engineered to be under control of the plant hormone gibberellic acid, applying the mechanism of chemically induced dimerization. Tight control and editing yields up to 44&#8201;% where achieved on endogenous targets in human cell culture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various RNA-targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site-directed adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose-dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20&#8201;% and 44&#8201;% in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease-relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42&#8201;%. The introduced principle will enable new applications where temporal or spatiotemporal control of an RNA-targeting mechanism is desired.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multilevel Chirality Transfer from Amino Acid Derivatives to Circularly Polarized Luminescence&#8208;Active Nanoparticles in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 48, Page 12305-12309, August 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5), and l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochlorides, two&#8208;step chirality&#8208;transferring systems have been successfully fabricated in aqueous solution. The chirality originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochloride, and transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, two kinds of chiral nanoparticle were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Chirality at different levels is widely observed in nature, but the clue to connect it all together, and the way chirality transfers among different levels are still obscure. Herein, a l&#8208;/d&#8208;lysine&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly system was constructed, in which two&#8208;step chirality transfer among three different levels was observed in aqueous solution. The chirality originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochloride, and was transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, with the aid of pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5, nanoparticles were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of up to &#177;0.001, arising from pyrene chiral excimers. This multilevel chirality transfer not only provides a perspective to trace potential clues, and to pursue certain ways by which the chirality transfers, but also offers a strategy to create controllable CPL emission in aqueous media.

Giving directions: A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was directed by the 2&#8208;pyridyl on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was easily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.







Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the N&#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example of the direct C6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron&#8208;rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.

&#8220;In this study, the first coordination of S&#8208;N moieties in the form of tetraimido sulfate ligands to lanthanide ions is showcased, which resulted in the isolation of unprecedented mono&#8208; and bimetallic lanthanide tetraimido sulfate complexes with gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, and erbium.

         <title>Formation and Structure of Hydrolytic Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me  3  Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen and Halogen Bonding in Homogeneous External Electric Fields: Modulating the Bond Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The sensitivity of single and multiple hydrogen (H) and halogen (X) bonding to external electric fields (EEFs) was analyzed. Computations show that the variations of X&#8208;bonds mainly stem from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect governs the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference from H&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. The sensitivity in multiple&#8208;bonding cases can be regulated by the permutations of noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both ab initio valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change to EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8722;95.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at the EEF strength 0.005&#8197;a.u.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of the Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid&#8208;mediated activation of an S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxide allows for the cyclization of peptides through metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation of arenes. The less electrophilic S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine sulfoxide serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of nucleophilic cysteine in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride under acidic conditions. It is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization, which results in the synthesis of an Amatoxin derivative and stapled peptide possessing a tryptathionine structure.







Abstract
Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapled peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol, which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of a thioether linkage between tryptophan and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapled peptides possessing the Cys&#8208;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less&#8208;electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of a Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Quinoidal Polymers Based on Dipyrrolopyrazinedione for Application in All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers (PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT) based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were developed for the use as polymer acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The all&#8208;PSCs with pseudo&#8208;bilayer structure exhibited PCEs of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;% for PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules and polymers with intrinsic quinoidal structure are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, which have been reported for application in field&#8208;effect transistors and thermoelectric devices. In principle, the molecular and electronic characteristics of quinoidal polymers can also enable their application in organic solar cells. Herein, two quinoidal polymers, named PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were synthesized and used as electron acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Both PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT showed suitable energy levels and wide light absorption range that extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. When combined with the polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the resulting all&#8208;PSCs based on PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;%, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;PSCs was revealed to be mainly limited by the relatively poor and imbalanced charge transport, considerable charge recombination. Detailed investigations on the structure&#8208;performance relationship suggested that synergistic optimization of light absorption, energy levels, and charge transport properties is needed to achieve more successful application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Engineered Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrion is a promising target in cancer therapy. However, gaining access to this organelle is difficult due to the obstacles to cross the complicated mitochondrial membrane. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability, named mitochondrion&#8208;targeting peptides (MTPs), are efficient tools to deliver exogenous therapeutics into mitochondria. Herein, we report several new MTPs, which can be readily synthesized via resin&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. In particular, MTP3 (compound 5), consisting of three positively charged arginines and two D&#8208; and L&#8208; alternating naphthylalanines, demonstrated excellent mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability with high Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient, suggesting that MTP3 has good potential for mitochondrion&#8208;targeted drug delivery. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the feasibility of MTP3 was validated by the preparation of a mitochondrion&#8208;targeting prodrug (compound 17, doxorubicin&#8208;based prodrug). This prodrug was subsequently confirmed to be specifically transported to the mitochondria of tumour cells, where it was able to release the native doxorubicin upon intracellular GSH activation, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and eventually cell death. Importantly, compound 17 showed good cytotoxicity against human tumour cells while negligible toxicity towards normal cells, indicating its potential as a potent mitochondrial medicine for targeted cancer therapy. Our study thus opens a way for engineered CPPs to be used to deliver bioactive cargos in mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Large&#8208;Polarization Ferroelectric with Second Harmonic Generation Response in a Novel Crown Ether Clathrate</title>

         <dc:description>
A modern material: A novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric, [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4], has successfully been synthesized; it underwent a reversible structural phase transition around Tc=348&#8197;K, with a wide band gap of 4.43&#8197;eV. The chief contributors to this are the C, H and O atoms of the crystals, the obvious second harmonic generation response and the large value of spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of around 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase transitions are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper is described the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4] (1) that shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348&#8197;K (heating) and 331&#8197;K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17&#8197;K by differential scanning calorimetry measurements, thus indicating that 1 undergoes a reversible structural phase transition. Variable&#8208;temperature PXRD and temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase&#8208;transition behavior of 1. The second harmonic response demonstrates that 1 belongs to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. In its semiconducting properties, 1 shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43&#8197;eV that comes chiefly from the C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of 1 exhibit a typical polarization&#8208;electric hysteresis loop with a large spontaneous polarization (Ps) of about 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic&#8208;inorganic and other hybrid crystals.

         <title>Molecular recognition of natural and non&#8208;natural substrates by cellodextrin phosphorylase from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum investigated by NMR spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;1&#8594;4&#8208;glucan polysaccharides like cellulose, derivatives and analogues, are attracting attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, as ideal candidates for many different applications in biotechnology. Access to these polysaccharides with a high level of purity at scale is still challenging, and eco&#8208;friendly alternatives using enzymes  in vitro  are highly desirable. One prominent candidate enzyme is cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from  Ruminiclostridium thermocellum  , which is able to yield cellulose oligomers from short cellodextrins and &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose 1&#8208;phosphate (Glc&#8208;1&#8208;P) as substrates. Remarkably, its broad specificity towards donors and acceptors allows the generation of highly diverse cellulose&#8208;based structures to produce novel materials. However, to fully exploit this CDP broad specificity, a detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of substrates by this enzyme in solution is needed. Herein we provide a detailed investigation of the molecular recognition of ligands by CDP in solution by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, tr&#8208;NOESY and protein&#8208;ligand docking. Our results, discussed in the context of previous reaction kinetics data in the literature, allow a better understanding of the structural basis of the broad binding specificity of this biotechnologically relevant enzyme.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite the synthesis and structural characterization of closo&#8208;hydroborate dianions, [BnHn2&#8208;(n = 6&#8208;12) more than 50 years ago, some ambiguity remains about the structure of B8H82&#8208;. Although solid state structure of&#160;B8H82&#8208;&#160;was established by single crystal X&#8208;ray studies in 1969, fast rearrangements in solution at accessible temperatures prevented its detailed characterization. We have therefore stabilized a derivative of&#160;B8H8(2&#8208;)&#160; using Cp2MBH3&#160;and structurally characterized two new octaborane analogues, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6)]&#160;(Cp = &#414;5&#8208;C5H5; M = Zr (1&#8208;Zr) and Hf (1&#8208;Hf)). The solid&#8208;state structures of both 1&#8208;Zr and 1&#8208;Hf comprise of a dodecahedron core, protected by Cp2MBH3 moieties on both sides of the cluster. The spectroscopic characterizations (11B NMR) validate the intactness of B8 dodecahedron core in solution as well. Theoretical calculations establish that the two exo&#8208;{Cp2MBH3} fragments provide structural and electronic structural stability to the B8 core and its intact dodecahedral dianionic nature. Furthermore, we have proposed isodesmic equations for the formation of higher analogue of Bn core&#160; guarded by different group 4 transition metals. Our analysis suggests that as we move to higher polyhedra (n &gt;10), the formation becomes unfavourable irrespective of metal.</dc:description>

We have therefore stabilized a derivative of&#160;B8H8(2-)&#160; using Cp2MBH3&#160;and structurally characterized two new octaborane analogues, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6)]&#160;(Cp = &#414;5-C5H5; M = Zr (1-Zr) and Hf (1-Hf)). The solid-state structures of both 1-Zr and 1-Hf comprise of a dodecahedron core, protected by Cp2MBH3 moieties on both sides of the cluster. The spectroscopic characterizations (11B NMR) validate the intactness of B8 dodecahedron core in solution as well. Theoretical calculations establish that the two exo-{Cp2MBH3} fragments provide structural and electronic structural stability to the B8 core and its intact dodecahedral dianionic nature. Furthermore, we have proposed isodesmic equations for the formation of higher analogue of Bn core&#160; guarded by different group 4 transition metals. Our analysis suggests that as we move to higher polyhedra (n &amp;gt;10), the formation becomes unfavourable irrespective of metal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Extending the FLP library: Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl or imidazolyl substituents act as intramolecular N/P frustrated Lewis pairs that are capable of small molecule activation, that is, reversible CO2 sequestration and binding of carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes.







Abstract
Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl (3[OTf]) or imidazolyl (4[OTf])&#8208;substituents act as intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) and reversibly form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts with CO2 (5+ and 6+). An unusual and labile spirocyclic tetrahedral intermediate (72+) is observed in CO2&#8208;pressurized (0.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;bar) solutions of cation 4+ at low temperatures, as demonstrated by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies, which were confirmed crystallographically. In addition, cations 3+ and 4+ actively bind carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, as shown by selected examples.

         <title>Segregated Protein&#8208;Cucurbit[7]uril Crystalline Architectures via Modulatory Peptide Tectons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One approach to protein assembly involves water&#8208;soluble supramolecular receptors that act like glue. Bionano&#8208;architectures directed by these scaffolds are often system&#8208;specific with few studies investigating their customization. Here, we describe the modulation of cucurbituril&#8208;mediated protein assemblies via the inclusion of peptide tectons. Three peptides of varying length and structural order were N&#8208;terminally appended to RSL, a &#946;&#8208;propeller building block. Each fusion protein was incorporated into crystalline architectures mediated by cucurbit[7]uril (Q7). A trimeric coiled coil served as a spacer within a  Q7 &#8208;directed sheet assembly of RSL, giving rise to a layered material of varying porosity. Within the spacer layers, the coiled coils were dynamic. This result prompted consideration of intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs) as modulatory tectons. Similar to the coiled coil, a mussel adhesion peptide (Mefp) also acted as a spacer between protein&#8208;Q7  sheets. In contrast, the fusion of a nucleoporin peptide (Nup) to RSL did not recapitulate the sheet assembly. Instead, a  Q  &#8208;directed cage was adopted, within which disordered Nup peptides were partially &#8220;captured&#8221; by  Q7  receptors. IDP capture occurred by macrocycle recognition of an intrapeptide Phe&#8208;Gly motif in which the benzyl side chain was encapsulated by  Q7. The modularity of these protein&#8208;cucurbituril architectures adds a new dimension to macrocycle&#8208;mediated protein assembly. In addition, the segregated crystals, with alternating layers of high and low porosity, provide a basis for new types of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication&#160;of ZnSe/C Hollow Polyhedrons for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnSe has got extensive attention for high&#8208;performance LIBs anode due to its remarkable theoretical capacity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the large volume variation for the ZnSe in the discharge/charge processes brings about rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance. Herein, ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons are successfully synthesized through selenization of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) coating. The protection of C layer derived from RF coating layer and Ostwald ripening during the process of selenization play important roles in promoting formation of ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons. The ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons exhibit good rate behavior and long&#8208;term cycle stability (345 mAh g  &#8722;1  up to 1000 cycles at 1 A g  &#8208;1  ) for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) anode. The improved electrochemical performance is benefit from the unique ZnSe/C hollow architecture, in which the hollow structure can effectively avoid terrible volume expansion, and the thin ZnSe/C shell can not only provide adequate diffusion paths of lithium ions and but also enhance the electronic conductivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoro&#8208;substitution on the ribose moiety (e.g., 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide) represents a popular way to modulate the ribose conformation and, hence, the structure and function of nucleic acids. In the present study, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxythymidine (  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T) and introduced it to oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs). Though scission of the glycosylic bond of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T followed by strand cleavage occurred to some extent under alkaline conditions, the  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T&#8208;modified ODNs were rather stable in neutral buffers. NMR studies showed that like 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside,  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T exists predominantly in the North conformation not only in the nucleoside form but also in the context of ODN strands. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, thermal denaturing and RNase H1 footprinting studies of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T&#8208;modified ODN/cDNA and ODN/cRNA duplexes indicated that the North conformation tendency of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T is maintained in the duplexes, leading to a local structural perturbation. Collectively, 4&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide structurally resembles the 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide but imparts less structural perturbation to the duplex than the latter.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals: growth, composition determination and phase stability in highly moist atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solutions have shown superior optoelectronic properties and better stability than their ABX  3  simple perovskite counterparts under ambient conditions. However, crystal growth and identification of the accurate composition of these complex crystalline compounds remain challenging, and their stability under extreme conditions such as in highly moist atmosphere is unknown. Herein, large&#8208;size (up to 2 cm) single crystals of ternary perovskite 0.80FAPbI  3  &#183;x'FAPbBr  3  &#183;y'CsPbI  3  (x' + y' = 0.20) are grown. An elemental analysis method based on wavelength dispersive X&#8208;ray fluorescence is proposed to determine their accurate compositions. Among these single crystals, the composition with y' = 0.12 shows the best moisture stability at 90% relative humidity for 15 days. Other components with richer or poorer Cs  +  ions undergo different phase segregation behaviours. The performance and stability of photodetectors based on these single crystals are tested. This work offers a deeper insight into phase stability of ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution crystals in highly moist atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the intrinsic activity and electrochemical surface area of MoS2 via tiny Zn doping: toward an efficient HER catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum sulfide (MoS  2  ) is considered as an alternative material for commercial platinum catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Improving the apparent HER activity of MoS  2  to a level comparable to that of Pt is an essential premise for the commercial use of MoS  2  . In this work, a Zn&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to enhance the HER performance of MoS  2  . We prove that tiny Zn doping into MoS  2  leads to the enhancement of the electrochemical surface area, increases in proportion of HER active 1T phase in the material and formation of catalytic sites of higher intrinsic activity. These benefits result in a high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 190 mV(@10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec  &#8208;1  . The origin for the excellent electrochemical performance of the doped MoS  2  is rationalized with both experimental and theoretical investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Quenched Lewis Acidity: Studies on the Medium Dependent Fluorescence of Zinc(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new zinc(II) coordination units  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  based on planar&#8208;directing tetradentate Schiff base&#8208;like ligands  H  2  (1  &#8211;  3)  were synthesized. Their solid&#8208;state structures were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing the tendency to overcome the square&#8208;planar coordination sphere by axial ligation. Affinity in solution towards axial ligation has been tested by extended spectroscopic studies, both in the absorption and emission mode. The electronic spectrum of the pyridine complex  [Zn(1)(py)]  has been characterized by multiconfiguration pair&#8208;DFT to validate the results of extended TD&#8208;DFT studies. Green emission of non&#8208;emissive solutions of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  in chloroform could be switched on in the presence of potent Lewis&#8208;bases. While interpretation in terms of an equilibrium of stacked/non&#8208;fluorescent and destacked/fluorescent species is in line with precedents from literature, the sensitivity of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  was greatly reduced. Results of a computation&#8208;based structure search allow to trace the hidden Lewis acidity of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  to a new stacking motif, resulting in a strongly enhanced stability of the dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolonging the Triplet State Lifetimes of Rhenium Complexes with Imidazole&#8208;pyridine Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into fuels offers the prospect for creating a new CO  2  economy. Harnessing visible light&#8208;driven CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction mediated by the long&#8208;lived triplet excited state of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes is a challenging approach. We here develop a series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes (  Re&#8208;1  &#8722;  Re&#8208;4  ) based on the imidazole&#8208;pyridine skeleton for photo&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction. These catalysts are featured by combining pyridyl&#8208;imidazole with the aromatic ring and different pendant organic groups onto the N1 position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit, which display phosphorescence under Ar&#8208;saturated solution even at ambient conditions. By contrast, {Re[9&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;10&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;pyreno[4,5&#8208;d]imidazole)](CO)  3  Cl} (  Re&#8208;4  ) by introducing pyrene ring at the N1 position of pyrene&#8208;fused imidazole unit exhibits superior catalytic performance with a higher turnover number for CO (TON  CO  = 124) and &gt;99.9% selectivity, primarily ascribed to the strong visible light&#8208;harvesting ability, long&#8208;lived triplet lifetimes (164.2 &#181;s) and large reductive quenching constant. Moreover, the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes derived from &#960;&#8208;extended pyrene chromophore exhibit a long lifetime corresponding to its ligand&#8208;localized triplet state (  3  IL) evidenced from spectroscopic investigations and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Shape&#8208;persistent Tetrahedral Porphyrin System: Light&#8208;induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraphenylmethane appended with four pyridylpyridinium units works as a scaffold to self&#8208;assemble four ruthenium porphyrins in a tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent giant architecture. The resulting supramolecular structure has been characterised in the solid state by X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis and in solution by various techniques. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirms the 1:4 stoichiometry with the formation of a highly symmetric structure. The self&#8208;assembly process can be monitored by changes of the redox potentials, as well as by modifications in the visible absorption spectrum of the ruthenium porphyrin and by a complete quenching of both the bright fluorescence of the tetracationic scaffold and the weak phosphorescence of the ruthenium porphyrin. An ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer is responsible for this quenching process. The lifetime of the resulting charge separated state (800 ps) is about four times longer in the giant supramolecular structure compared to the model 1:1 complex formed by the ruthenium porphyrin and a single pyridylpyridinium unit. Electron delocalization over the tetrameric pyridinium structure is likely to be responsible for this effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Arylmethylene Substitutions on Molecular Structure, Optoelectronic Properties and Photovoltaic Performance of Dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we developed two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based SMAs (DTCFSV&#8208;IC and DTCFDV&#8208;IC) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA (DTCFO&#8208;IC) without conjugated side chains. Combined with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, DTCFSV&#8208;IC&#8208;based polymer solar cells (PSCs) delivered an inferior PCE but an increased Voc of 1.04 V relative to DTCFO&#8208;IC. Whereas, an enhanced PCE of 8.89% was realized for DTCFDV&#8208;IC&#8208;based PSCs due to concurrently increased Voc (1.04 V) and Jsc (15.98 mA cm&#8208;2). When PBDB&#8208;T was substituted with PBDB&#8208;TF, the DTCFDV&#8208;IC&#8208;based PSC produced a further increased Voc of 1.14 V, but a slightly reduced PCE of 8.30%. Encouragingly, for the PBDB&#8208;TF:DTCFDV&#8208;IC system, a comparably high PCE of 8.82% was achieved when o&#8208;xylene (XY) was used to replace chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvent. The superior device performance of PSCs based on PBDB&#8208;T:DTCFDV&#8208;IC (CB) and PBDB&#8208;TF:DTCFDV&#8208;IC (XY) could be ascribed to higher and more balanced carrier mobility, more efficiently charge transfer, weaker bimolecular recombination, and better active layer morphology and miscibility. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device&#160;physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.</dc:description>

Combined with polymer donor PBDB-T, DTCFSV-IC-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) delivered an inferior PCE but an increased Voc of 1.04 V relative to DTCFO-IC. Whereas, an enhanced PCE of 8.89% was realized for DTCFDV-IC-based PSCs due to concurrently increased Voc (1.04 V) and Jsc (15.98 mA cm-2). When PBDB-T was substituted with PBDB-TF, the DTCFDV-IC-based PSC produced a further increased Voc of 1.14 V, but a slightly reduced PCE of 8.30%. Encouragingly, for the PBDB-TF:DTCFDV-IC system, a comparably high PCE of 8.82% was achieved when o-xylene (XY) was used to replace chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvent. The superior device performance of PSCs based on PBDB-T:DTCFDV-IC (CB) and PBDB-TF:DTCFDV-IC (XY) could be ascribed to higher and more balanced carrier mobility, more efficiently charge transfer, weaker bimolecular recombination, and better active layer morphology and miscibility. This work argues that the introduction of methylene-functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device&#160;physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermetallic Compounds: Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Characterized by long&#8208;range atomic ordering, well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, and controlled crystal structure, intermetallics have attracted increasing attention in the area of chemical synthesis and catalytic applications. Liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics has arisen as the promising methodology due to its precise control over size, shape, and resistance toward sintering compared with the traditional metallurgy. This short review tends to provide perspectives on the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics in terms of both thermodynamics and methodology, as well as its applications in various catalytic reactions. Specifically, basic thermodynamics and kinetics in the synthesis of intermetallics will be first discussed, followed by discussing the main factors that will affect the formation of intermetallics during synthesis. The application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis will be demonstrated case by case at last. We conclude the review with perspectives on the future developments with respect to both synthesis and catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breathing phenomenon in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has revealed supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions, which could be beneficial for chemical separation in numerous industrial applications. The cost&#8208;effective purification of C  8  alkyl aromatics such as o&#8208;xylene, p&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, and ethylbenzene still remains challenging owing to their similar molecular structures, boiling points, kinetic diameters, polarities, etc. Herein, we report two Zn&#8208;based pillar&#8208;bilayered MOFs, denoted as [Zn  2  (aip)  2  (pillar)]; aip = 5&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid; pillar: bpy = 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or bpe = 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane, which exhibit a breathing effect depending on the adsorbed guest molecules. Guest&#8208;dependent sorption studies using organic solvents such as  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylformamide, methanol,&#160; benzene, and water vapor displays reversible structural flexibility through breathing effect in both framework compounds. Motivated by these sorption studies, the conducted experiments on C  8&#8208;alkyl aromatics resulting in both MOF compounds can access these isomers in the shrunken pores and, thereby expand the pore size by framework breathing. In C  8  binary mixtures, these Zn&#8208;MOFs exhibit selective sorption properties based on the different interactions between guest C  8  aromatics interactions and framework structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Strategy to Design and Construct AIE&#8208;active Mechanofluorochromic Materials via Regulation of Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we first designed and synthesized tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives  TM&#8208;1~4  via regulation of molecular structure,which were consisted of 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline, 1H&#8208;phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole, 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole, 3,3'&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)dipyridine moieties and AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene units, respectively. The results illustrated that  TM&#8208;1~4  exhibited obvious AIE characteristics. Meanwhile,  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  show excellent solid emission properties (&#934;  TM&#8208;2  =13.73% and &#934;  TM&#8208;3  =36.21%), whereas  TM&#8208;1  and  TM&#8208;4  exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;  TM&#8208;1  =1.48% and &#934;  TM&#8208;4  =4.83%). The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene ring) causes twisted conformations of the molecule that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid emission(&#934;  TM&#8208;2  &lt;&#934;  TM&#8208;3  , &#934;  TM&#8208;1  &lt;&#934;  TM&#8208;4  ). Significantly,  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;  TM&#8208;2  =43 nm and &#916;&#955;  TM&#8208;3  =41 nm) with color changes between blue and green emissions. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) suggested the disordered state of ground sample could be readily returned to an ordered crystalline. Therefore, the mechanochromisms of  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  are ascribable to the phase transformation between crystal and amorphous structure. The single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of  TM&#8208;2  reveals a twisted conformation for  TPE  moiety and the absence of &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular stacking. These excellent optical properties of  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  make them potentially applications in mechanochromic materials and imaging agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Functional Differences of Cysteine and 3&#8208;Mercaptopropionate Dioxygenases: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spheres of influence: Although cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase bind and react similar substrates, there are key differences in the first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination spheres that affect their catalytic reaction mechanism and reactivity, as highlighted by density functional theory studies on large enzyme clusters.







Abstract
Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health; they are involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine. As such, these enzymes have relevance to the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large, active&#8208;site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo&#8208;bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes in substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.

         <dc:description>
Going against the grain: Photocatalytic, contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is described. The reaction permits the geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The reaction manifold was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is disclosed. The reaction, based on the transient formation of a suitable chromophore with a BINOL derivative as the catalyst, allowed geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The mechanism of this E&#8594;Z contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization was studied, and the formation of a transient chromophore species is suggested.

         <title>Rational Design of a Confacial Pentaoctahedron Anisotropic Exchange in a Linear ZnIIFeIIIFeIIIFeIIIZnII Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first confacial pentaoctahedron comprised of transition metal ions namely Zn  II  Fe  III  A  Fe  III  B  Fe  III  A  Zn  II  has been synthesized using a dinucleating nonadentate ligand. The face&#8208;sharing bridging mode enforces short Zn  II  &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Fe  III  A  and Fe  III  A  &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Fe  III  B  distances of 2.83 and 2.72 &#197;, respectively.  Ab&#8208;initio  CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations provide significant negative zero&#8208;field splittings for Fe  III  A  and Fe  III  B  with \  D  A  \ &gt; \  D  B  \ with the main component along the  C  3  axis. Hence, a spin&#8208;Hamiltonian comprised of anisotropic exchange, zero&#8208;field, and Zeeman term was employed. This allowed by following the boundary conditions from the theoretical results the simulation in a theory&#8208;guided parameter determination with  J  xy  =+0.37,  J  z  =&#8208;0.32,  D  A  =&#8208;1.21,  E  A  =&#8208;0.24,  D  B  =&#8208;0.35, and  E  B  =&#8208;0.01 cm  &#8208;1  supported by simulations of high&#8208;field magnetic M&#246;ssbauer spectra recorded at 2 K. The weak but ferromagnetic Fe  III  A  Fe  III  B  interaction arises from the small bridging angle of 84.8&#176; being at the switch from anti&#8208; to ferromagnetic for the face&#8208;sharing bridging mode.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Conductance Switching Realized by a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Imine Polymer Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving your memory: Combining the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer pore of pillar[5]arene with the nanometer pore structure of two&#8208;dimensional polymers provides a multichannel for Ag+ migration so that a ternary&#8208;state memristor based on the conductive filament mechanism could be designed. The obtained Ag/2DPTPAZ+TAPB/ITO devices show excellent ternary memory performance, including low threshold voltage, steady retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio, considerable ternary yield, and good thermal stability and flexibility.







Abstract
Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.&#8201;e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired so as to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report the first multichannel strategy to realize a ternary&#8208;state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of a two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with multilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2=1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;103), and high ternary yield (75&#8201;%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DPTPAZ+TAPB can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after being bent 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a temperature as high as 300&#8201;&#176;C. It is envisioned that the results of this work will open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption, and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;Phase Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native mass spectrometry is now widely used in protein structural studies. We present a methodology for probing the importance of specific residues in the stabilization of compact protein structure in the gas&#8208;phase using a combination of chemical modification and collision induced unfolding ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.

         <title>On the roles of electron transfer in catalysis by nanoclusters and nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron transfer plays a major role in chemical reactions and processes, and this is particularly true in catalysis by nanomaterials. The advent of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts recently including atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs) as parts of nanocalyst devices has brought an increased control of the relationship between the NP and NC structures and their catalytic functions. Consequently, the molecular definition of these new nanocatalysts has allowed a better understanding and management of various kinds of electron transfers involved in the catalytic processes. In this mini&#8208;review I am bringing a chemist's view of several major aspects of electron transfer functions concerning NPs and NCs in catalytic processes. Particular focus concerns the role of NPs and NCs as electron reservoirs and light&#8208;induced antenna in catalytic processes from H  2  generation to more complex reactions and sustainable energy production.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Metal Complexes of a Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane Functionalized Amidinate Ligand: Synthesis and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (DPPM) functionalized amidine ligand (DPPM&#8208;C(N&#8208;Dipp)  2  H) (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) was synthesized. Subsequent deprotonation with suitable alkali metal bases resulted in the corresponding complexes [M{DPPM&#8208;C(N&#8208;Dipp)  2  }(L  n  )] (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; L = thf, Et  2  O).

         <title>Facile Preparation of CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Moving one step further beyond lithium? A nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 material has been synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Its excellent rate performance, outstanding cycling stability and pseudocapacitive energy storage properties give it promise for use as an efficient cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered a promising energy&#8208;storage device due to their high energy density and high safety, but they still suffer from a lack of high&#8208;rate performance and cycle performance of the cathode. Nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites have been synthesized for the first time by a facile solvothermal method. Herein, the magnesium ion storage behavior when applied in the cathode for RMBs is discussed. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 256&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and an outstanding long&#8208;term cyclic stability over 300&#8197;cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the electrochemical storage mechanism demonstrated that the storage process of magnesium ion in the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 cathode is mainly driven by strong pseudocapacitive effects.

         <dc:description>The first total syntheses of the  Stemona  alkaloid dehydrostenine A and the structure assigned to dehydrostenine B have been completed from a simple pyrrole substrate in 10 and 11 steps, respectively. Two independent Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular Michael additions were exploited to construct the tetracyclic dehydrostenine core. As a result of our synthetic studies and associated analysis of the relevant literature, we propose revisions of the structures originally assigned to dehydrostenines A and B.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazophosphonates: Effective surrogates for Diazoalkanes in Pyrazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazophosphonates, readily prepared from a&#8208;ketophosphonates by oxidation of the corresponding hydrazones in batch or in flow, are useful partners in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles, including the first intramolecular examples of such a process. The phosphoryl group imbues a number of desirable properties in the diazo 1,3&#8208;dipole. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the phosphoryl stabilizes the diazo compound making it easier to handle, whilst the ability of the phosphoryl group to migrate readily in a [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enables its transfer from C to N to aromatize the initial cycloadduct, and hence its facile removal from the final pyrazole product. Overall, the diazophosphonate acts as a surrogate for the much less stable diazoalkane in cycloadditions, with the phosphoryl group playing a vital, but traceless, role. The cycloaddition proceeds more readily with alkynes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, and is regiospecific with unsymmetrical alkynes. The potential for use of diazophosphonates in bioorthogonal cycloadditions is demonstrated by their facile addition to strained alkynes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe oxidatively induced regioselective intramolecular C&#8208;C bond formations based on the Rh  III  complexes synthesized from dirhodium(II) trifluoroacetate with 2&#8208;arylpyridines. With the selection of electron donating groups on the arene rings of 2&#8208;arylpyridines, the unusual  meta  &#8208;  ortho  C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming was favored, which led to the formation of  meta  &#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylpyridine homocoupling dimers. On the contrary, the electron withdrawing groups have tendency to occur conventional  ortho&#8208;ortho  bond&#8208;forming, resulting in the formation of new Rh  III  complexes possessing the intriguing Rh  III  (TFA)  3  fragment. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of Rh  III  occurred in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported CuII Single Ion Catalyst for Total&#8208;carbon Utilization of C2&#8208;C3 Biomass&#8208;based Platform Molecules in N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shift from fossil carbon sources to renewable ones is vital for developing sustainable chemical processes to produce valuable chemicals. In this work, value&#8208;added formamides were synthesized in good yields by the reaction of amines with C2&#8208;C3 biomass&#8208;based platform molecules such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. These feedstocks were selectively converted by catalysts based on Cu&#8208;containing zeolite 5A via in&#8208;situ formation of carbonyl&#8208;containing intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which all the carbon atoms in biomass&#8208;based feedstocks might be amidated to result in the formamide product. Combined catalyst characterization results revealed preferably single CuII sites on the surface of Cu/5A, some of which form small clusters, but without direct linkage via oxygen bridges. By combing the results of EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spin&#8208;trapping, operando ATR&#8208;IR (attenuated total reflection infrared) spectroscopy and control experiments, it has been found that the formation of formamides might involve a HCOOH&#8208;like intermediate and &#8226;NHPh radicals, where the selective formation of &#8226;OOH radicals might play a key role.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (  1  ) with cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208; or anthracene&#8208;stabilised metalate anions of iron and cobalt consistently afford complexes of the rarely encountered 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene ligand, which have previously been very challenging synthetic targets. The subsequent reactivity of 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward various electrophiles has also been investigated and is compared to reactions of related 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The results highlight the distinct reactivity of such isomeric species, showing that the 1,2&#8208;isomers can act as precursors for previously unknown triphospholium ligands. The electronic structures of the new complexes were investigated by several methods, including NMR, EPR and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopies as well as quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared spectrum of the first excited state of Au2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au  2  +  is a simple but crucial model system for understanding the diverse catalytic activity of gold. While the Au  2  +  ground state (X  2  S  g  +  ) is understood reasonably well from mass spectrometry and computations, no spectroscopic information is available its first excited state (A  2  S  u  +  ). Herein, we present the vibrationallyresolved electronic spectrum of this state for cold Ar&#8208;tagged Au  2  +  cations. This exceptionally low&#8208;lying and well isolated A  2  S  (u)  +  &#172;X  2  S  (g)  +  transition occurs in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. The observed band origin (5738 cm  &#8208;1  , 1742.9 nm, 0.711 eV) and harmonic Au&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Ar stretch frequencies (201 and 133 cm  &#8208;1  ) agree surprisingly well with those predicted by standard time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. The linearly&#8208;bonded Ar tag has only little impact on both the geometric and electronic structure of Au  2  +  , because the Au  2  +  &#8230;Ar bond (0.4 eV) is much weaker than the Au&#8208;Au bond (2.2 eV). As a result of 6s&#172;5d excitation of an electron from the antibonding s  u  * orbital (HOMO&#8208;1) into the bonding s  g  orbital (SOMO), the Au&#8208;Au bond contracts substantially (by 0.1 &#197;).</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trivalent lanthanide heteroleptic sandwich complexes with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) and cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligands shows a significant bending of the Cnt ligand when the size of the ion decreases, implying a size&#8208;controlled hapticity switch.







Abstract
Sandwich complexes of lanthanides have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as Single Molecule Magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln=Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by 1H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.

         <title>Achieving High Efficiency at High Luminance in Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Triplet&#8211;Triplet Fusion Based on Phenanthroimidazole&#8208;Benzothiadiazole Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
On a high: A series of phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;based fluorescent donor&#8211;acceptor molecules were designed and synthesized. They exhibited emissions ranging from green to red with high photoluminescence quantum yield in the solid state. These molecules also showed highly efficient electroluminescence at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application of any kind of light&#8208;emitting diode (LED). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP&#8208;, PIBzPCN&#8208;, and PIBzTPA&#8208;based devices showed EQEs of 8.27, 9.15, and 8.64&#8201;%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselectivity of the peptide coupling between aminoacidylnucleotides and amino acid esters in aqueous condensation buffer was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Homochiral dipeptides were found as the preferred products.







Abstract
Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in&#8197;situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5&#8242;&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios&#8804;62&#8201;:&#8201;38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.

An attractive precursor 3&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) with coplanar bicyclic backbone was synthesized. Two nitrated products of 5 were prepared, and a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich energetic salts were obtained and systematically characterized. These 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials exhibited high combined nitrogen and oxygen content and outstanding enthalpies of formation along with good detonation performance and an acceptable safety profile. Among them, N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide and its dihydroxylammonium salt were screened as the most balanced energetic materials.







Abstract
Combining different nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine&#8208;tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Here, 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4&#8208;triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3&#8208;(5&#8208;Amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) was designed and synthesized. Nitramino&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (6) and N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (7) were also obtained, and two series of corresponding nitrogen&#8208;rich salts were prepared, leading to the creation of new energetic compounds. All derivatives were fully characterized, and five of them were further confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials were studied. Compound 7 and its dihydroxylammonium salt (7&#8201;c) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to that of RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.

         <title>Stepwise Stress&#8208;Induced Transformations of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedral Cluster&#8208;Based Assemblies: Where Conformational and Supramolecular Features Meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squeezed to change: We demonstrate that a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered metal complex with remote phenyl rings can undergo reversible pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events.







Abstract
Understanding the factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity to the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergoing pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events. The observed phase transitions illustrate the key role of an interplay between the low&#8208;energy conformation perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722;, Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) containing the weakly coordinating anion [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722; are reported. Some phenyl derivatives in combination with different alkyl chains were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window. In contrast to gallates with standard cations (EMIM, BMIM) the gallate&#8208;TAAILs are stable even up to high electrochemical potentials. Thus, they are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications. More information can be found in the Communication by B. Hoge, T. Strassner, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102097).

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert on the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like the arms of a dancer, which are waved following the rhythm of the music but avoid colliding with her head or her body; the flexible arms of expanded helicenes find different pathways to reverse their position depending on the size and nature of the insert placed in the innermost zone of their fjord. This work presents the synthesis of a series of in&#8208;fjord substituted expanded helicenes and an estimation of their inversion barriers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum calculations. Interestingly, the energetic profile of the inversions is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions.

         <title>Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent lithium storage is achieved by the double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8208;SiO2@N&#8208;C anode material. The outermost N&#8208;C shell can improve the electronic conductivity and promote the dispersion of PMo12 clusters. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion and accelerate Li+ diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. He, W. Chen, Y.&#8208;F. Song et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101638).

         <title>Photoinduced water oxidation in chitosan nanostructures containing covalently&#8208;linked Ru(II) chromophores and encapsulated iridium oxide nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The luminophore Ru(bpy)  2  (dcbpy)  2+&#160;  is covalently&#8208;linked to a chitosan polymer; cross&#8208;linking by tripolyphosphate produced Ru&#8208;decorated chitosan fibers (NP&#8208;RuCh  ), with a 20:1 ratio between chitosan repeating units and Ru(II) chomophores. The properties of the Ru(II) compound are unperturbed by the chitosan structure, with  NP&#8208;RuCh  exhibiting&#160; metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) absorption and emission bands of Ru(II) complexes. When cross&#8208;linking is made in the presence of IrO  2  nanoparticles, such species are encapsulated within the nanofibers, so generating the  IrO  2&#8208;  NP&#8208;RuCh  system, in which both Ru(II) photosensitizers and IrO  2  water oxidation catalysts are within the nanofiber structures.  NP&#8208;RuCh  and  IrO  2&#8208;  NP&#8208;RuCh  have been characterized by DLS, SEM, and EDX, which indicated a 2:1 ratio between Ru(II) chromophores and IrO  2  species. Photochemical water oxidation has been investigated using  IrO  2&#8208;  NP&#8208;RuCh  as the chromophore/catalyst assembly and persulfate anions as sacrificial species: the photochemical water oxidation yields O  2  with a quantum yield (F) of 0.21, definitely higher than the F obtained by a similar solution containing separated Ru(bpy)  3  2+  and IrO  2  nanoparticles (0.05) as well as with respect to that obtained using  NP&#8208;RuCh  and &#8220;free&#8221; IrO  2  nanoparticles (0.10).A fast hole scavenging process (rate constant, 7 x 10  4  s  &#8208;1  ) involving the oxidized photosensitizer and the IrO  2  catalyst within the  IrO  2  &#8208;NP&#8208;RuCh  system is at the basis of the improved photochemical quantum yield of  IrO  2  &#8208;NP&#8208;RuCh  .</dc:description>

         <title>Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Gallium(III)&#8208;Polypyridyl Complexes Bearing Diflunisal</title>

Breaking &#8216;hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill&#8217; bone cancer cells with gallium: Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) are linked to the poor prognosis of metastasised osteosarcoma. Here a gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complex is reported, containing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, diflunisal, capable of killing OSCs more effectively than frontline and secondary anti&#8208;osteosarcoma drugs. The complex evokes cell death by inhibiting cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series, 6 (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably, 6 exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that 6 downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore, 6 induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, 6 is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.

         <title>Topological Transformation of Mg&#8208;Containing Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Efficient Photodriven CH4 Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructural Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst, MgCo&#8208;800, was synthesized by topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MgCo&#8208;LDH) precursor. With its highly dispersed active sites and abundant interfaces, MgCo&#8208;800 enabled surface activation of CH4 to methyl species and showed remarkable photodriven CH4 coupling to C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane (CH4) to fuels and other high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive technology in the chemical industry; however, practical challenges to sustainable processes remain. Herein, we report the preparation of a heterostructured Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst through topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) calcination from 200 to 1100&#8201;&#176;C. Remarkably, the catalyst can activate CH4 coupling to produce C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation through calcination of LDH at 800&#8201;&#176;C. Characterization studies and catalytic results suggest that the highly dispersed active sites and large interfaces amongst the Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalysts enable surface activation of CH4 to methyl (CH3*), in turn promoting coupling of CH3* to C2H6. This study introduces a promising pathway for photodriven CH4 coupling to give high value&#8208;added chemicals by using layered double hydroxides as a precursor.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Stabilized Pnictinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair, 1, with trichlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony allowed the isolation of oxidative addition products. Reduction of these compounds with sodium metal or LiBHEt3 led to the synthesis of a phosphinidene, an arsinidene and a stibinidene. After halide abstraction, a germaphosphene, 8, was isolated, and its 31P NMR data were analyzed by using quantum chemical calculations. The product of an Al&#8722;H addition was found upon treating the phosphinidene with [iBu2AlH]2.







Abstract
The reaction of the intramolecular germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4GeAr* (1) with Group 15 element trichlorides ECl3 (E=P, As, Sb) was investigated. After oxidative addition, the resulting compounds (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)ECl2 (2: E=P, 3: E=As, 4: E=Sb) were reduced by using sodium metal or LiHBEt3. The molecular structures of the phosphine&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)P (5), arsinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)As (6) and stibinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)Sb (7) are presented; they feature a two&#8208;coordinate low&#8208;valent Group 15 element. After chloride abstraction, a cyclic germaphosphene [(o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)GeP] [B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (8) was isolated. The 31P NMR data of the germaphosphene were compared with literature examples and analyzed by quantum chemical calculations. The phosphinidene was treated with [iBu2AlH]2, and the product of an Al&#8722;H addition to the low&#8208;valent phosphorus atom (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(H)P(H)Al(C4H9)2 (9) was characterized.

         <title>Electrocatalytic H2 Generation from Water Relying on Cooperative Ligand Electron Transfer in &#8220;PN3P&#8221; Pincer&#8208;Supported NiII Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Towards sustainable H2 production: To bring electrocatalytic hydrogen production into the sustainable realm, earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts should function with water as the substrate. These newly reported hydrogen&#8208;generating catalysts of NiII are robust, stable in air and electrocatalytically reduce water to hydrogen with excellent Faradaic efficiency. Computations supplemented our understanding of a unique ligand&#8208;based electron transfer with the cooperativity of the PN3P ligand as an electron reservoir as a requirement for successful catalysis.







Abstract
Water is the most sustainable source for H2 production, and the efficient electrocatalytic production of H2 from mixed water/acetonitrile solutions by using two new air&#8208;stable nickel(II) pincer complexes, [Ni(&#954;3&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=H I, Me II) is reported. Hydrogen generation from H2O/CH3CN solutions is initiated at &#8722;2&#8197;V against Fc+/0, and bulk electrocatalysis studies showed that the catalyst functions with an excellent Faradaic efficiency and a turnover frequency of 160&#8197;s&#8722;1. A DFT computational investigation of the reduction behavior of I and II revealed a correlation of H2 formation with charge donation from electrons originating in a reduced ligand&#8208;localized orbital. As a result, these catalysts are proposed to proceed by a novel mechanism involving electron/proton transfer between a Ni0I species bonded to an anionic PN3P ligand (&#8220;L&#8722;/Ni0I&#8221;) and a NiI&#8208;hydride (&#8220;Ni&#8722;H&#8221;). Furthermore, these catalysts are able to reduce phenol and acetic acid, more active proton sources, at lower potentials that correlate with the substrate pKa.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Ultra&#8208;Stretchable Strain Sensors Based on Emulsion Gels with Broad Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking the strain: An emulsion gel with high stretchability and conductivity was fabricated and could be used as a strain sensor to detect human motion over a broad operating temperature. First, an emulsion that was ultra&#8208;stable at high and low temperatures was prepared by introducing glycerol into a W/W emulsion. Then, the continuous phase was polymerized to produce a macroporous emulsion gel. Finally, an emulsion&#8208;gel&#8208;based strain sensor with good flexibility, conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and adhesion properties was fabricated to detect the full range of human body movement. The sensor exhibited remarkable sensing sensitivity, rapid responsiveness, and reliability. For more information, see the Full Paper by J. Hao et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101472).

         <title>Octapalladium Strings Trap C60 and C70 Fullerenes Affording Metal&#8208;Chain&#8208;Wired Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover picture shows octapalladium metal strings catching a soccer ball of C60 or C70 fullerene in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction to give metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired bucky balls. The enantiopure chiral Pd8 strings also afforded the chiral bucky balls through dimensionally and chirality controlled self&#8208;assembly. These findings could provide a new platform for developing functional metal&#8208;carbon nanocomposite materials, including nano&#8208;electronics with unusual properties derived from the combination of redox active fullerenes and metal chains.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our understanding of the factors affecting the stability of cyclic  d  /  l  peptide (CP) nanotubes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CP nanotube stability through X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterise the distinct CP&#8208;CP alignments that can form and identify stable and unstable dimers by MD simulation. We measure H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives of synthesised CPs by  1  H&#8208;D exchange experiments and find good correlation with predicted CP&#8208;CP stabilities. We find that hydrophobic amino acids improve CP dimer stability but experimentally reduce solubility. Charged amino acids either increase or decrease CP dimer stability depending on the relative orientation and composition of charged groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are solved for two CPs, revealing non&#8208;tubular folded conformations. Ultimately, this work will assist the educated design of stable tubular structures for potential applications in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Agile Detection of Chemical Warfare Agents by Machine Vision: a Supramolecular Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart(phone) recognition: A new fluorescent sensor able to interact noncovalently with DMMP, a CWA simulant, has been synthetized and tested both in solution and in the gas phase. The detection limit in solution is much lower than the toxicity values of CWAs; in the gas phase sensing can be performed on a simple smartphone. With acid/base treatment, the solid device can be reused. This prototype paves the way for the smart detection of nerve agents.







Abstract
The supramolecular detection by image analysis of a simulant chemical warfare agent on a solid device containing a selective molecular sensor based on a BODIPY scaffold is reported. The recognition properties were investigated in solution, demonstrating high affinity (log&#8201;K&#8197;6.60) and sensitivity (LOD 10&#8197;ppt). A test strip also confirmed the sensing properties in gas phase. Image analysis of the solid device allows quantitative information about the simulant to be obtained, recovering the sensor almost 5&#8197;times and thus confirming the goal of the supramolecular approach.

         <title>Novel Cofacial Porphyrin&#8208;Based Homo&#8208; and Heterotrimetallic Complexes of Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde is presented in this work. Besides the novel aryl&#8208;based, trans&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene trisporphyrin, we investigated the respective cis&#8208;isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar&#8208;chiral trisporphyrin. The homotrimetallic Mn(III)&#8208;, Fe(III)&#8208;, Ni(II)&#8208;, Cu(II)&#8208;, Zn(II)&#8208; and Pd(II) complexes and the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) heterotrimetalic complex were synthesized, the metal ion insertion process studied and the resulting compounds investigated by e.&#8201;g. UV&#8208;Vis, photoluminescence or high&#8208;resolution IMS measurements.







Abstract
We present a straightforward and generally applicable synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes. The protocol encompasses synthesising the first aryl&#8208;based, trans&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene trisporphyrin starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde with an overall yield of 3.6&#8201;%. It also allows investigating the respective cis&#8208;isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar&#8208;chiral trisporphyrin. The free&#8208;base ligand was used in subsequent metalation reactions to afford the corresponding homotrimetallic Mn(III)&#8208;, Fe(III)&#8208;, Ni(II)&#8208;, Cu(II)&#8208;, Zn(II)&#8208; and Pd(II) complexes &#8211; additionally, a small adaptation of the protocol resulted in the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) complex in a total yield of 2.3&#8201;%. By monitoring Ni(II) insertion into the empty trimeric ligands, we affirmed that the outer porphyrin rings are filled before the internal ring. The molecular species were characterised by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, photoluminescence, IR, MS, CID, and high&#8208;resolution IMS measurements.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A synthesis route&lt;/b&gt; for cofacially linked homo- and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde is presented in this work. Besides the novel aryl-based, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene trisporphyrin, we investigated the respective &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar-chiral trisporphyrin. The homotrimetallic Mn(III)-, Fe(III)-, Ni(II)-, Cu(II)-, Zn(II)- and Pd(II) complexes and the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) heterotrimetalic complex were synthesized, the metal ion insertion process studied and the resulting compounds investigated by e.&#8201;g.

         <title>Syntheses, Structures, Reactivities, and Basicities of Quinolinyl and Isoquinolinyl Complexes of an Electron Rich Chiral Rhenium Fragment and Their Electrophilic Addition Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title complexes exhibit much higher basicities than the parent heterocycles, undergo facile N&#8208;methylation followed by diastereselective nucleophile additions, and can serve as nucleophilic catalysts. These attributes are interpreted with the aid of crystal structures and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Reactions of Li+ [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)]&#8722; with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;chloroquinoline or 1&#8208;chloroisoquinoline give the corresponding &#963; quinolinyl and isoquinolinyl complexes 3, 6, and 8. With 3 and 8 there is further protonation to yield HCl adducts, but additions of KH give the free bases. Treatment of 3 with HBF4&#8901;OEt2 or H(OEt2)2+ BArf&#8722; gives the quinolinium salts [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NH)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+ X&#8722; (3&#8208;H+ X&#8722;; X&#8722;=BF4&#8722;/BArf&#8722;, 94&#8211;98&#8201;%). Addition of CF3SO3CH3 to 3, 6, or 8 affords the corresponding N&#8208;methyl quinolinium salts. In the case of [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+ CF3SO3&#8722; (3&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722;), addition of CH3Li gives the dihydroquinolinium complex (SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;[(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CHCH3)(CH2))]+ CF3SO3&#8722; ((SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;5+ CF3SO3&#8722;, 76&#8201;%) in diastereomerically pure form. Crystal structures of 3&#8208;H+ BArf&#8722;, 3&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722;, (SReRC, RReSC)&#8208;5+ Cl&#8722;, and 6&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722; show that the quinolinium ligands adopt Re&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C conformations that maximize overlap of their acceptor orbitals with the rhenium fragment HOMO, minimize steric interactions with the bulky PPh3 ligand, and promote various &#960; interactions. NMR experiments establish the Br&#248;nsted basicity order 3&gt;8&gt;6, with Ka(BH+) values &gt;10 orders of magnitude greater than the parent heterocycles, although they remain less active nucleophilic catalysts in the reactions tested. DFT calculations provide additional insights regarding Re&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C bonding and conformations, basicities, and the stereochemistry of CH3Li addition.

         <title>Trigonal Prismatic Coordination of Discrete Rare Earth Ions, Enforced by the Polyoxotungstate [P4W27O99(H2O)]16&#8211;</title>

Controlled partial decomposition of the organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized V&#8208;shaped polyoxotungstate [P4W24O92(C6H5PVO)2]16&#8722; generates a {Na&#8834;P4W27} macrocycle with an endo&#8208;oriented pocket that defines an isosceles trigonal&#8208;prismatic coordination environment for yttrium(III) and a wide range of lanthanide(III) ions. The [Na&#8834;{LnIII(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]12&#8722; series undergoes five consecutive (quasi&#8208;)reversible redox transformations.

Abstract
A family of solution&#8208;stable polyanions [Na&#8834;{LnIII(H2O)}{WVIO(H2O)}PV4WVI26O98]12&#8722; (Ln=Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu and Y) represent the first examples of polyoxometalates comprising a single lanthanide(III) or yttrium(III) ion in a rare trigonal prismatic O6 environment. Their synthesis exploits the reactivity of the organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized precursor [P4W24O92(C6H5PVO)2]16&#8722; with heterometal ions and yields hydrated potassium or mixed lithium/potassium salts of composition KxLnyH12&#8211;x&#8211;y[Na&#8834;{Ln(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]&#8901;nH2O&#8901;mLiCl (x=8.5&#8211;11; y=0&#8211;2; n=24&#8211;34; m=0&#8211;1.5).

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali&#8208;Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI=Li&#8722;Cs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI[SeCN] with AI=Li&#8722;Rb were synthesized by oxidation of cyanides with selenium or by metathesis (AI=Cs). Whereas all reactions proceed in solution, LiSeCN can only be obtained solvent free by ball milling. All compounds were crystallographically characterized, their structures optimized by DFT methods and their vibrational spectra recorded. DSC measurements showed congruent melting and allowed for extraction of the melting points.







Abstract
The full series of quasibinary alkali&#8208;metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (A=Li&#8722;Rb) or by metathesis (A=Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O).

A catalytic domino reduction / imine formation / intramolecular cyclization / oxidation allows the synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles. The reported process employs an inexpensive and nontoxic dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex as catalyst, easily available nitroarenes as starting materials and different glycols as reducing agents with reuse of the waste reduction carbonyl byproduct, which is embodied into the final compounds.







Abstract
A catalytic domino reduction&#8211;imine formation&#8211;intramolecular cyclization&#8211;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of a Synthetic Route to Biaryls by the Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Arylsulfonium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational investigations revealed that, depending on the structure and electronic features of the substrates in the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols, the reaction pathway of the rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangements of the interrupted Pummerer intermediates can vary due to changes in energy synchronicity. As an extreme case, when an electron&#8208;rich phenol is involved, the rearrangement is no longer concerted, but instead stepwise via a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding aryl sulfide and phenoxonium cation.







Abstract
A comprehensive mechanistic investigation was conducted on the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by using trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield biaryls. NMR experiments revealed that our previously proposed mechanism, which consists of a cascade of an interrupted Pummerer reaction and a rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, is reasonable. The electronic effects of the substrates were also evaluated to elucidate the nature of the rearrangement step. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we conclude that the rearrangement is highly asynchronous and stepwise rather than concerted when electron&#8208;rich phenols are employed for the reaction.

         <title>Hybrid Self&#8208;Assembled Gel Beads for Tuneable pH&#8208;Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s all in the delivery: Self&#8208;assembled gel beads have been fabricated using different supramolecular gelators in combination with a calcium alginate polymer gelator and loaded with the statin drug rosuvastatin. The rate of rosuvastatin release is shown to depend on both the pH of the receiving solution and the precise gel bead composition. As such, these gel beads are capable of doubly controlled release.







Abstract
This article describes the fabrication of new pH&#8208;responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;d&#8208;sorbitol: pH&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;COOH and thermally responsive DBS&#8208;CONHNH2, thus clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads by using this approach. We also demonstrate that self&#8208;assembled multicomponent gel beads can be formed by using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS&#8208;COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present upon raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid&#8208;lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH&#8208;dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the pKa of the API. The extent of pH&#8208;mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS&#8208;COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three&#8208;component DBS&#8208;COOH/DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug&#8208;delivery applications.

     alt="Hybrid Self-Assembled Gel Beads for Tuneable pH-Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&#8242;s all in the delivery&lt;/b&gt;: Self-assembled gel beads have been fabricated using different supramolecular gelators in combination with a calcium alginate polymer gelator and loaded with the statin drug rosuvastatin. The rate of rosuvastatin release is shown to depend on both the pH of the receiving solution and the precise gel bead composition. As such, these gel beads are capable of doubly controlled release.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article describes the fabrication of new pH-responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4-dibenzylidene-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-sorbitol: pH-responsive DBS-COOH and thermally responsive DBS-CONHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads by using this approach. We also demonstrate that self-assembled multicomponent gel beads can be formed by using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS-COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present upon raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid-lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH-dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the API. The extent of pH-mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS-COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three-component DBS-COOH/DBS-CONHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug-delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study of Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin cycle: The IR spectra of molecular platinum fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. PtF4 is formed almost quantitatively under blue light radiation of PtF6, while PtF5 and PtF3 were produced by subsequent UV radiation of PtF4. The coexistence of a singlet and a triplet electronic spin state of PtF4 caused by competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrix.







Abstract
Molecular platinum fluorides PtFn, n=1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF6 embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser&#8208;ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices under cryogenic conditions provide, for the first time, experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF3, PtF4 and PtF5. Photolysis of PtF6 enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF4, whereas both PtF5 and PtF3 were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF4. The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help of one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computation to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF4, for which a spin&#8208;triplet (3B2g, D2h) coexists with an electronic singlet state (1A1g, D4h) in solid neon matrices.

         <dc:description>Despite common occurrence in molecules of value, methods for transforming sulfonamides are distinctly lacking. Here we introduce easy&#8208;to&#8208;access sulfonyl pyrroles as synthetic linchpins for sulfonamide functionalization. The versatility of the sulfonyl pyrrole unit is shown by generating a variety of products through chemical, electrochemical and photochemical pathways. Preliminary results on the direct functionalization of primary sulfonamides are also provided, which may lead to new modes of activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Eu(III) Coordination luminophore Standing on Silica Nanoparticles By Two Legs for Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we demonstrated a two&#8208;legs standing&#8208;up molecular design method for mono&#8208;chromatic and bright red luminescent Ln(III)&#8208;silica nanomaterials. A novel Eu(III)&#8208;silica hybrid nanoparticle using double binding TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3  (TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) linker were developed. The TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3&#160;  was determined by  1  H,  31  P,  29  Si NMR spectroscopy and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Luminescent Eu(hfa)  3&#160;  and Eu(tfc)  3&#160;  parts (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3&#8208;(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed on the TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3&#160;  modified silica nanoparticles, producing in Eu(hfa)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2&#160;  and Eu(tfc)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2  , respectively. The Eu(hfa)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2&#160;  exhibited higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98 ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported Eu(III)&#8208;based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2&#160;  also showed extra&#8208;large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3  )  2&#160;  was found to be 39%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3&#160;  linker is a promising candidate for development of Eu(III)&#8208;based luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the synthetic and biological potential of organotellurium substances, we describe here the synthesis and characterization of a series of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring organotelluranes containing a Te&#8211;O bond. Theoretical calculations elucidated the mechanism for the oxidation&#8208;cyclization processes involved in the formation of the heterocycles, consistent with chlorine transfer to hydroxy telluride, followed by cyclization step with simultaneous formation of the new Te&#8211;O bond and the OH group deprotonation. Moreover, theoretical calculations also indicated anti &#8208;diastereoisomers as major products for two&#8208;chirality center&#8208;containing compounds. Antileishmanial assays against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes disclosed 1,2&#955; 4 &#8208;oxatellurane LQ50 (IC 50 = 4.1&#177;1.0; SI = 12), 1,2&#955; 4 &#8208;oxatellurolane LQ04 (IC 50 = 7.0&#177;1.3; SI = 7) and 1,2&#955; 4 &#8208;benzoxatellurole LQ56 (IC 50 = 5.7&#177;0.3; SI = 6) as more powerful and more selective compounds, up to four times more active than the reference. Stability study supported by 125 Te NMR analyses showed that these heterocycles do not suffer structural modifications in aqueous&#8208;organic media and up to 65 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Although incorporation of photo&#8208;activatable lipids into membranes potentially opens up novel avenues for investigating interactions with proteins, the question of whether diazirine&#8208;modified lipids are suitable for such studies, remains under debate. Focusing on the potential for studying lipid/peptide interactions by cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS), we developed a diazirine&#8208;modified lipid (DiazPC), and examined its behavior in membranes incorporating the model &#945;&#8208;helical peptide LAVA20. We observed an unexpected backfolding of the diazirine&#8208;containing stearoyl chain of the lipid. This surprising behavior challenges the potential application of DiazPC for future XL&#8722;MS studies of peptide and protein/lipid interactions. The observations made for DiazPC most likely represent a general phenomenon for any type of membrane lipids with a polar moiety incorporated into the alkyl chain. Our finding is therefore of importance for future protein/lipid interaction studies relying on modified lipid probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C^N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, characterization and photoluminescent properties of four cyclometalated (C^N)&#8208;type gold(III) complexes bearing a bidentate diacetylide ligand, tolan&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diacetylide (tda), are reported. The complexes exhibit highly tunable excited state properties and show photoluminescence (PL) across the entire visible spectrum from sky&#8208;blue (&#955;  PL  = 493 nm) to red (&#955;  PL  = 675 nm) with absolute PL quantum yields (PLQY) of up to 75% in solution, the highest PLQY found for any monocyclometalated Au(III) complex in solution. As a consequence of the use of the strongly rigidifying diacetylide bidentate ligand, a significant increase in the excited state lifetimes (&#964;  0  = 16&#8211;258 &#956;s) was found in solution and in thin films. The complexes showed remarkable singlet oxygen generation in aerated solution with absolute singlet oxygen quantum yields (&#981;  1&#916;  ) values reaching up to 7.5 x 10  &#8211;5  and singlet oxygen lifetimes (&#964;  0  1&#916;  ) in the range of 66&#8211;95 &#956;s. Furthermore, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates of singlet oxygen were determined using the &#981;  1&#916;  and &#964;  0  1&#916;  values and correlations are drawn between the formation of singlet oxygen and its interaction with cyclometalated (C^N) gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Masked N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;isocyanates: Support for Oxadiazolones as Blocked N&#8208;Isocyanate precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to carbon&#8208;substituted isocyanates that are common building blocks,  nitrogen  &#8208;substituted isocyanates remain underdeveloped and reports on their  N  &#8208;acyl derivatives (i.e. amidoisocyanates) are exceedingly rare. Herein amido&#8208;isocyanates were investigated in the context of syntheses of aza&#8208;tripeptide and hydantoins subunits starting from simple bench&#8208;stable precursors. A key finding is that the amido&#8208;isocyanate formed  in situ  cyclized to yield an oxadiazolone, and that under suitable reaction conditions this heterocycle is a traceless blocked (masked)  N  &#8208;isocyanate. Using organic bases as catalysts and upon heating, oxadiazolone formation is observed, and various nucleophiles to provide the desired azadipeptides or hydantoins in moderate to high yields. Further support for an amido&#8208;isocyanate intermediate was obtained using carboxylic acids as nucleophiles, affording  N  &#8208;acylhydrazide products.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited state charge separation in an azobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide dimer &#8211; effect of photochemical trans&#8208;cis isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced charge transfer and separation events in a newly synthesized azobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide&#8208;dimer (PDIdimer) are demonstrated. Trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis coversion (~50% efficiency) from the initial trans PDI&#8208;dimer by 355 nm pulsed laser light, and its reversal, cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans, process by 435 nm laser light irradiation has been possible to accomplish. Efficient fluorescence quenching in the PDI&#8208;dimer, more so for the cis isomer was witnessed, and such quenching increased with increasing solvent polarity. DFT&#8208;calculated geometry and electronic structures helped in visualizing the charge transfer in the PDI&#8208;dimer in both isomeric forms, and also revealed certain degree of participation of the azobenzene entity in the charge transfer events. Femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies confirmed occurrence of both charge transfer followed by charge separation in the studied PDI&#8208;dimer in both trans and cis forms in polar solvents, and the evaluated time constants from target data analysis revealed accelarated events in the cis PDI&#8208;dimer due to proximity effects. The present study offers key insights on the role of the azobenzene bridge, and the dimer geometry in governing the excited state charge transfer and separation in symmetrically linked PDI dimer.</dc:description>

In the present study, a two&#8208;component donor&#8211;acceptor approach has been applied to create a variety of organic MCL composites that exhibit remarkable emission&#8208;wavelength switching.

         <title>Analyzing Anisotropic Exchange in a Pentanuclear Os2Ni3 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic properties of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 complex have been calculated from complete active space wave function calculations including spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The calculated anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange interactions in combination with a negative g value for octahedral OsIII centres reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility.







Abstract
Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence&#8208;type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin&#8208;orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a single&#8208;step procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size. The one&#8208;centre parameters (local 
 matrices and single&#8208;ion zero field splitting tensors) are within an expected range, the anisotropic exchange parameters obtained in this work for an Os&#8722;Ni pair are not exceedingly large but determine the low&#8208;T part of the experimental &#967;T curve. Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange coupling constant is 
&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and the D parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange is 
&#8722;1, so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic J (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large&#8208;temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative g value of the Os centres. This negative g value is a universal feature of a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination with 
 configuration and strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN)
 is a versatile building block for the synthesis of 
/
 magnetic materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnetic properties&lt;/b&gt; of a pentanuclear Os
Ni

The calculated anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange interactions in combination with a negative &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; value for octahedral Os&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centres reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence-type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin-orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a single-step procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size. The one-centre parameters (local 
 matrices and single-ion zero field splitting tensors) are within an expected range, the anisotropic exchange parameters obtained in this work for an Os&#8722;Ni pair are not exceedingly large but determine the low-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; part of the experimental &lt;i&gt;&#967;T&lt;/i&gt; curve. Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange coupling constant is 
&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange is 
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt; (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large-temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; value of the Os centres. This negative &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; value is a universal feature of a pseudo-octahedral coordination with 
 configuration and strong spin-orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN)

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8722;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic functionalization: The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most important transformations in organic synthesis, but its efficiency depends on its selectivity, which can be controlled by the innate reactivity of the substrate or a directing group. While this last strategy has turned out to be efficient, the directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation. These two undesired synthetic operations can be avoided by using the transient directing group strategy that is comprehensively overviewed in this review article.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8722;H bond, this selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8722;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8722;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are sometimes still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the in&#8197;situ installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8722;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of DFT calculations, we show that the experimental orthorhombic (Pbca) structure of the argentate AgF2, which displays an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order perpendicular to the long axis of the lattice, comes from a cooperative trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion of (AgF6)4&#8722; complexes in a cubic Pa&#8208;3 high&#8208;symmetry reference phase. As a consequence, the system, displaying three equivalent minima, is ferroelastic and displays a strong magneto&#8208;elastic effect that controls the orientation of the AFM order.







Abstract
In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2 and the cuprate La2CuO4. We explored the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2 by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2. Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2 and AgF2. Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2 is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+ ions occupy trigonal sites that, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local E&#8855;e trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+&#8722;F&#8722; bonds increase their distance by 15&#8201;% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors, and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes might be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, these results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2 is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using an atomic hydrogen source and a supersonic molecular beam of oxygen, the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) was covalently functionalized with molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen. Investigation of the system by high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that only the pores of the nanomesh are functionalized whereas the wires remain unaffected. This selectivity leads to spatially defined chemical functionalization of the corrugated two&#8208;dimensional material. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Papp et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101946).

         <title>Polymorphic Phosphorescence from Separable Aggregates with Unique Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions causing the action: Square planar platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to unique photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated by column chromatography. Solid&#8208;state structures, quantum chemical calculations, concentration&#8208;dependent excitation&#8211;emission spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state emission spectroscopy help to rationalize and shed light on the nature of this phenomenon.







Abstract
Platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to different photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated directly by column chromatography. Solid&#8208;state structures as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirmed the effect of the interactions on the photophysical properties.

         <title>Covalent Patterning of 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach to patterning 2D MoS2 through covalent functionalization of electron beam lithography (EBL)&#8208;defined guiding patterns has been demonstrated by A. Hirsch et al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102021). This approach opens a convenient avenue for spatially designing and engineering MoS2 nanostructures, and would benefit further exploration of MoS2&#8208;based devices and facilitate efficient manufacture.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photothermal properties of nanoparticles (NP), i.e. their ability to convert absorbed light into heat, have been studied since the end of the past century mainly on gold NP. In the new millennium these studies developed into a burst of research dedicated to the photothermal ablation of tumors. However, beside this strictly medical theme, researches have flourished also in the connected areas of photothermal antibacterial surface coatings, gels and polymers, of photothermal surfaces for cell stimulation, as well as in purely technological areas that do not involve medical biotechnology. These include the direct conversion of solar light into heat, a more efficient sun generation of steam and the use of inkjet printed patterns of photothermal NP for anticounterfeit printing based on temperature reading, to cite a few. After an analysis on the photothermal effect (PTE) and of its mechanism, this minireview briefly considers the antitumoral therapy theme and dedicates in deep to all the other technological and biomedical applications of the PTE, with a particular attention to the photothermal materials whose NP have joined those based on Au</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 by Activation of Binary Nitrides ScN and TiN with NH4F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinary transition metal nitrides and oxonitrides are a versatile and intriguing class of compounds. However, in comparison to pure oxides, they are much less investigated. The compounds Sc  5  P  12  N  23  O  3  and Ti  5  P  12  N  24  O  2  were now synthesized from the binary nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively, following a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 8 GPa and 1400 &#8211; 1700 &#176;C. NH  4  F acts as a mineralizing agent that supports product formation and crystallization. The starting materials ScN and TiN are seemingly an uncommon choice because of their chemical inertness but react nevertheless under these conditions. Sc  5  P  12  N  23  O  3  and Ti  5  P  12  N  24  O  2  crystallize isotypically with Ti  5  B  12  O  26,  consisting of solely vertex&#8208;sharing P(O/N)  4  tetrahedra forming two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like nets which host  TM  (O/N)  6  (  TM  = Sc, Ti) octahedra. Ti  5  P  12  N  24  O  2  is a mixed&#8208;valence compound and shows ordering of Ti  3+  and Ti  4+  ions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonding between ions of like charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonding occurs between molecules featuring Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases. It is often rationalized as a predominantly electrostatic interaction and thus interactions between ions of like charge (e.g. of anionic halogen bond donors with halides) seem counter&#8208;intuitive. Herein, we provide an overview on such complexes. First, theoretical studies are described and their findings are compared. Next, experimental evidence is presented in the form of crystal structure database analyses, recent examples of strong &#8220;anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonding in crystals, and the observation of such interactions also in solution. We then compare these complexes to select examples of &#8220;counter&#8208;intuitive&#8221; adducts formed by other interactions, like hydrogen bonding. Finally, we comment on key differences between charge&#8208;transfer and electrostatic polarization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced catalytic performance of Quasi&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 for the tandem Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu  3  (BTC)  2  (H  2  O)  3  ]  n  &#183;nH  2  OMeOH (HKUST&#8208;1) has been submitted to thermolysis under air atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 &#176;C. This treatment produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as  quasi  MOFs, were subsequently employed as heterogeneous catalysts in the one pot synthesis of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline from aniline and benzyl alcohol in open air as terminal oxidant at 70 &#176;C under base&#8208; and dehydrating agent&#8208;free conditions. The Q&#8208;HKUST catalysts calcined at 240 &#176;C (QH&#8208;240) was the most efficient in the series, promoting imine synthesis. Data from Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile shows that in QH&#8208;240 the distances of Cu ions in HKUST&#8208;1 cavities are preserved, increasing the Knoevenagel activity, but a strong rearrangement takes place at 300  o  C or above. The unsaturated copper active sites with simultaneous presence of micro&#8208; and mesopores in QH&#8208;240 are responsible for this excellent catalytic performance. The effective parameters on catalytic activity of QH&#8208;240 including deligandation temperature, the amount of catalyst, the ratio of reactants, and reaction temperature as well as the stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also investigated. The possible mechanism used by QH&#8208;240 follows alcohol aerobic oxidation and subsequent anaerobic condensation of aldehyde intermediate with aniline.</dc:description>

         <title>Backbonding in Thorium(IV) and Uranium(IV) Diarsenido Complexes with tBuNC and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination of tBuNC and CO with the diarsenido complexes, (C5Me5)2An(&#951;2&#8208;As2Mes2), An = Th, U, has been investigated. For the first time, a comparison between isostructural complexes of Th(IV) and U(IV) has been possible with CO, indicating an appreciable amount of &#960; backbonding which originates from charge transfer from an actinide&#8208;arsenic sigma bond according to density functional calculations. The calculated CO stretching frequencies in the Th(IV) and U(IV) diarsenido complexes are consistent with the experimental measurements, both with large red shifts. We demonstrate that the &#960; backbonding is crucial in explaining the red shifts of CO frequency upon An(IV) formation. Interestingly, this interaction essentially correlates to the parallel orientation of &#960;*(C&#8208;O) orbital relative to the An&#8208;As bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterated Indocyanine Green (ICG) With Extended Aqueous

Storage Shelf&#8208;Life: Chemical and Clinical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dye that is used extensively for various imaging and diagnostic procedures. A drawback with ICG is its instability in water which means that reconstituted clinical doses have to be utilized very shortly after preparation. Two deuterated versions of ICG were prepared with deuterium atoms on the heptamethine chain, and the spectral, physiochemical, and photostability properties were quantified. A notable mechanistic finding is that self&#8208;aggregation of ICG in water strongly favors dye degradation by a photochemical oxidative dimerization reaction that gives a non&#8208;fluorescent product. Storage stability studies showed that replacement of C&#8208;H with C&#8208;D slowed the dimerization rate constant by a factor of 3.1, and it is likely that many medical and pre&#8208;clinical procedures will benefit from the longer shelf&#8208;lives of these two deuterated ICG dyes. The discovery that ICG self&#8208;aggregation promotes photoinduced electron transfer can be exploited as a new paradigm to design next&#8208;generation photodynamic therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;valent Germanylidene Anions: Efficient Single&#8208;site Nucleophiles for Activation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare mononuclear and helical chain low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene and hypermetallyl ligands were synthesized by stepwise reduction from corresponding germylene precursors via stable acyclic germanium radicals. The germanylidene anions can be described with ylidene and ylidone resonance forms of which the latter becomes prevalent when engaging with electrophiles. Reactions of CO  2  resulted in the formation of &#956;&#8208;CO  2  &#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O adducts, a previously uncharacterized coordination mode for low&#8208;valent germanium and inaccessible for related neutral ylidones. These results implicate low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions as efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles for activation of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of saturated carbon&#8208;carbon fragment is the critical challenge of organic synthesis; therefore, developing new methods for formation of these bonds is paramount. The rising interest for reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions is conditioned by its versatile applications, allowing the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The review aims to highlight the advantages and disadvantage of reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions to total synthesis of pharmaceutical substances in order to summarize knowledge, and encourage further investigation of the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting Alkane Hydroxylation with m&#8208;CPBA (mChloroperbenzoic Acid) Catalyzed by Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies are performed on the alkane hydroxylation with  m  &#8208;CPBA (  m  &#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid) catalyzed by nickel(II) complexes, Ni  II  (L). In the oxidation of cycloalkanes, Ni  II  (TPA) acts as an efficient catalyst with a high yield and a high alcohol selectivity. In the oxidation of adamantane, the tertiary carbon is predominantly oxidized. The reaction rate shows first&#8208;order dependence on [substrate] and [Ni  II  (L)] but is independent on [  m  CPBA];  v  obs  =  k  2  [substrate][ Ni  II  (L)]. The reaction exhibited a relatively large kinetic deuterium isotope effect (  KIE  ) of 6.7, demonstrating that the hydrogen atom abstraction is involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, Ni  II  (L) supported by related tetradentate ligands exhibit apparently different catalytic activity, suggesting contribution of the Ni  II  (L) in the catalytic cycle. Based on the kinetic analysis and the significant effects of O  2  and CCl  4  on the product distribution pattern, possible contributions of (L)Ni  II  &#8211;O&#8226; and the acyloxyl radical as the reactive oxidants are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Atypical And Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;P,N&#8208;Ligands: The Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of Cycloiminophosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel 7&#8208;membered cyclic imine&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;P,N&#8208;ligands were obtained by capturing an  in situ  generated Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These &#8216;cycloiminophosphanes&#8217; possess flexible non&#8208;isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity, which sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated using their P&#8208;&#954;  1  &#8208; and P,N&#8208;&#954;  2  &#8208;tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the  trans  &#8208;CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl  2  ]  2  demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, by giving a dynamic equilibrium of &#954;  1  &#8208; and &#954;  2  &#8208;species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the &#954;  2  &#8208;complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the Ru  II  &#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free hydration of benzonitrile and the Ru  II  &#8208; and Ir  I  &#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from  l  &#8208;menthone, as well as their P,N&#8208;&#954;  2  &#8208;Rh  III  &#8208; and a P&#8208;&#954;  1  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural Diversity of Molecular Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Polyphosphides: From Supramolecular Wheel to Zintl Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of molecular group&#8208;2 polyphosphides has been synthesized by using air&#8208;stable [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )] (Cp* = C  5  Me  5  ) or white phosphorus as polyphosphorus precursors. Different types of group&#8208;2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium, and molecular calcium&#8208;hydride complexes have been investigated to activate these polyphosphorus sources. The organo&#8208;magnesium complex [(  Dipp  BDI&#8208;Mg(CH  3  ))  2  ] (  Dipp  BDI = {[2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  NCMe]  2  CH}  &#8722;  ) reacts with [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )] to give an unprecedented Mg/Fe&#8208;supramolecular wheel. Kinetically controlled activation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )] by different mono&#8208;valent magnesium complexes allowed the isolation of Mg&#8208;coordinated formally mono&#8208; and di&#8208;reduced products of [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )]. To obtain the first examples of molecular calcium&#8208;polyphosphides, a molecular calcium&#8208;hydride complex was used to reduce the aromatic  cyclo  &#8208;P  5  ring of [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )]. The Ca&#8208;Fe&#8208;polyphosphide is also characterized by quantum chemical calculations and compared with the corresponding Mg complex. Moreover, a calcium coordinated Zintl ion (P  7  )  3&#8208;  was obtained by molecular calcium&#8208;hydride mediated P  4  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ca[B8O11(OH)4]:Eu2+&#8722;a Highly Efficient Deep Blue&#8208;emitting Phosphor Prepared by Low&#8208;temperature Self&#8208;reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B  8  O11(OH)  4  ]:Eu  2+  (CBH:Eu  2+  ). The crystal structure, morphology, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence (PL) properties of CBH:Eu  2+  phosphor have been investigated. By using a screened hybrid functional (HSE06), the calculated band gap (  E  g  ) of CBH was 7.48 eV. The results shows that almost all the added raw materials of Eu  3+  can be reduced to Eu  2+  in CBH crystal with a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH:Eu  2+  phosphor show broad excitation spectrum in the range of 220 to 400 nm, and narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428 nm in the range of 400 to 500 nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35 nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH: 2%Eu  2+  exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0%) and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6%). The PL intensity of CBH: 2%Eu  2+  remained 62.6% of the initial intensity at 150  o  C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH:2%Eu  2+  , excited by a 365 nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825 K. The above results show that CBH:Eu  2+  might be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to develop and design new type high&#8208;efficiency phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, we prepared molecular crystals containing a cationic amphiphile having azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from Systems Chemistry viewpoint.</dc:description>

         <title>Galactose Grafted Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets as a Scaffold for the In&#8208;situ Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles: A Potential Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8208;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8208;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines through Aryne Three&#8208;Component Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into position: Aryne multicomponent coupling triggered by pyridines allows the broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines bearing a &#8722;CF3 group by engaging &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be used as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway.







Abstract

New gallate&#8208;TAAILs (imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids) containing the weakly coordinating tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate anion, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8208;, are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications. Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) in combination with different alkyl chain lengths from 1&#8211;12 carbon atoms were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Contrary to the gallate&#8208;TAAIls, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability.







Abstract
We synthesized new imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) with the weakly coordinating tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate anion, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722;. Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) were combined with varying alkyl chain lengths at the imidazolium core leading to TAAILs, which were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity, and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Remarkable low viscosities of 29 cP at 25&#8201;&#176;C for [BMIM][Ga(C2F5)4] were achieved. However, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability, releasing pentafluoroethane at a voltage of 1.5&#8197;V. The 2&#8208;Me&#8208;substituted gallate&#8208;TAAILs slowly decompose over several weeks, whereas all other gallate&#8208;TAAILs showed no decomposition at all. With electrochemical windows of up to 5.15&#8197;V and low viscosities in a range of 66&#8211;162&#8197;cP, the gallate&#8208;TAAILs are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are capable to generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation with green light only, when bound to polynucleotides by intercalation, whereas they slowly decompose when irradiated in water showing poor sensitization activity. Enhanced sensitization activity is observed upon interaction with AT but not GC base pairs. This makes them interesting for applications, where singlet oxygen has to be generated with local control.







Abstract
There is an ongoing interest in 1O2 sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes 2&#8201;o&#8211;p and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for 1O2. In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA 1O2 is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of 2&#8201;o&#8211;p with DNA were investigated by thermal DNA melting studies, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and linear and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer 2&#8201;o in poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of 1O2 was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of 1O2 quenchers. When bound to poly(dG&#8201;:&#8201;dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers 2&#8201;o and 2&#8201;m, namely the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical 1O2 generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.

In the metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8211;&#948;Ge136, a Ge framework forms 20&#8208; and 28&#8208;atom cages (drawn with gray and bluish faces) hosting the Na guest atoms. The stopwatch hands give the actual number of Na atoms found per unit cell. In type&#8208;II clathrates, the guest atoms arrange with hierarchical relation to the C15 Laves phase and the oxygen partial structure of &#946;&#8208;Cristobalite. The latter is shown by white lines between Na atoms, turning red where only this partial structure is drawn. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. B&#246;hme et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Impact of C2 Insertion into a Carbazole Donor on the Physicochemical Properties of Dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;Cored Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads</title>

Plus 2: C2 insertion into well&#8208;known electron&#8208;donating carbazole unit brought about a drastic change in the physicochemical properties of dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;core twisted donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triad compounds. The slight structural modification at the donor unit led to a thermodynamic preference for quasi&#8208;axial conformations, dual emission comprising room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation, and unique electrochemical behavior.







Abstract
Novel electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) compounds comprising dibenzo[a,j]phenazine as the central acceptor core and two 7&#8208;membered diarylamines (iminodibenzyl and iminostilbene) as the donors have been designed and synthesized. Investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C2 insertion into well&#8208;known carbazole electron donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;core D&#8208;A&#8208;D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, electrochemical analysis suggested sigma&#8208;dimer formation and electrochemical polymerization on the electrode. Quantum chemical calculations also rationalized the experimental results.

&lt;p&gt;Novel electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D-A-D) compounds comprising dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a,j&lt;/i&gt;]phenazine as the central acceptor core and two 7-membered diarylamines (iminodibenzyl and iminostilbene) as the donors have been designed and synthesized. Investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion into well-known carbazole electron donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a,j&lt;/i&gt;]phenazine-core D-A-D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room-temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, electrochemical analysis suggested sigma-dimer formation and electrochemical polymerization on the electrode. Quantum chemical calculations also rationalized the experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent lithium storage was achieved by the double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C nanocomposites. The outermost N&#8722;C shell can improve the electronic conductivity and promote the dispersion of PMo12 clusters. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can benefit a faster lithium&#8208;ion kinetics by shorten lithium&#8208;ion diffusion path and buffer volume expansion during lithiation/delithiation process. And PMo12, as an electron sponge, can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and accelerate electron transfer of the composite.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based materials, with high theoretical capacities and abundant reversible multi&#8208;electron redox properties, are considered as promising candidates in lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the poor electronic conductivity, low specific surface area and high solubility in the electrolyte limited their practical applications. Herein, a double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C nanofiber (PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C, where PMo12 is [PMo12O40]3&#8722;, N&#8722;C is nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) was fabricated for the first time by combining coaxial electrospinning technique, thermal treatment and electrostatic adsorption. As an anode material for LIBs, the PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C delivered an excellent specific capacity of 1641&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles under 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The excellent electrochemical performance benefited from the unique double&#8208;shelled hollow structure of the material, in which the outermost N&#8722;C shell cannot only hinder the agglomeration of PMo12, but also improve its electronic conductivity. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion and accelerate Li+ diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. Moreover, PMo12 can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and facilitate electron transfer of the entire composites, as evidenced by the EIS kinetics study and lithium&#8208;ion diffusion analysis. This work paves the way for the fabrication of novel POM&#8208;based LIBs anode materials with excellent lithium storage performance.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Emissive Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0), and Tungsten(0) Complexes in the Solid State at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents emissive Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual visible and NIRII emission at room temperature and represent a milestone in the design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR luminophores. The emissive excited states were characterized by luminescence lifetime investigations and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) via Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value at room temperature. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Gerhards, B. Sarkar et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102208).

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles More Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The very low basicity and nucleophilicity of the phosphorus donor in phosphinines can be drastically increased by introducing strongly &#963;&#8208;donating Me3Si substituents to the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle. The highest gas&#8208;phase basicity was found for 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine, which is even more basic in the gas phase than pyridine. This finding led to the first quantitative synthesis of a phosphinine selenide by treating red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102390).

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert on the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep in&#8208;fjord substitution is presented as a new tool to control the mechanical properties of expanded helicenes. The syntheses of a series of these compounds containing internal inserts is described and their overall inversion profile is calculated. Interestingly, the interplay between steric and dispersion interactions play a major role in shape of the inversion profiles (energies, number of transition states and intermediates).







Abstract
A series of expanded helicenes of different sizes and shapes incorporating phenyl&#8208; and biphenyl&#8208;substituents at the deepest part of their fjord have been synthesized via sequential Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of appropriately designed diynes, and their racemization barriers have been calculated employing electronic structure methods. These show that the overall profile of the inversions (energies, number of transition states and intermediates, and their relative position) is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions. Hence, in&#8208;fjord substitution constitutes an additional tool to handle the mechanical properties in helicenes of uncommonly large diameter. The photochemical characterization of the newly prepared helical structures is also reported.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Ultra&#8208;Stretchable Strain Sensors Based on Emulsion Gels with Broad Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High stretchability (more than 1000&#8201;%) and conductivity (0.67&#8197;S/m) emulsion gels were fabricated from emulsions and the introduction of glycerol endowed them with broad operating temperature (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The emulsion gel based strain sensors showed high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of full&#8208;range human motions.







Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical elasticity and conductivity are ideal materials in wearable devices. However, traditional hydrogels are fragile upon mechanical loading and lose functions in climate change because the internal water undergoes freeze and dehydration. Herein, we synthesize stable emulsions at high and low temperatures by introducing glycerol into the W/W emulsions. Then the high&#8208;stable emulsions are used as templates to produce the freestanding emulsion gels with enhanced mechanical strength and conductivity. The introduction of glycerol endows emulsions and emulsion gels with high and low temperature resistance (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The fabricated strain sensors based on emulsion gels show high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), high stretchability (1081&#8201;%), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of various human motions. These high&#8208;performance and eco&#8208;friendly emulsion gels can be promising candidates for next&#8208;generation artificial skin and human&#8208;machine interface.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High stretchability&lt;/b&gt; (more than 1000&#8201;%) and conductivity (0.67&#8197;S/m) emulsion gels were fabricated from emulsions and the introduction of glycerol endowed them with broad operating temperature (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The emulsion gel based strain sensors showed high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), fatigue resistance, self-healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of full-range human motions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels with mechanical elasticity and conductivity are ideal materials in wearable devices. However, traditional hydrogels are fragile upon mechanical loading and lose functions in climate change because the internal water undergoes freeze and dehydration. Herein, we synthesize stable emulsions at high and low temperatures by introducing glycerol into the W/W emulsions. Then the high-stable emulsions are used as templates to produce the freestanding emulsion gels with enhanced mechanical strength and conductivity. The introduction of glycerol endows emulsions and emulsion gels with high and low temperature resistance (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The fabricated strain sensors based on emulsion gels show high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), high stretchability (1081&#8201;%), fatigue resistance, self-healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of various human motions. These high-performance and eco-friendly emulsion gels can be promising candidates for next-generation artificial skin and human-machine interface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Chiral Molecular Cage Comprising Diethynylallenes and N&#8208;Heterotriangulenes for Enantioselective Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a match! A novel shape&#8208;persistent chiral cage constituting two N&#8208;heterotriangulene lids and three bis(diethynylallene) branches is reported, along with UV/vis complexation studies with both charged and neutral helicenes. Enantioselective discrimination was observed, which, in combination with the redox behavior of the host, makes the system appealing as a model for dual sensors with both chiral and electronic modulation.







Abstract
Chirality, a characteristic tool of molecular recognition in nature, is often a complement of redox active systems. Scientists, in their eagerness to mimic such sophistication, have designed numerous chiral systems based on molecular entities with cavities, such as macrocycles and cages. In an attempt to combine chirality and redox&#8208;active species, in this contribution we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of a chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage based on the combination of enantiopure diethynylallenes and electron&#8208;rich bridged triarylamines, also known as N&#8208;heterotriangulenes. Its ability for chiral recognition in solution was revealed through UV/vis titrations with enantiopure helicenes.

         <title>Modulating the Enantiodiscrimination Features of Inherently Chiral Selectors by Molecular Design: A HPLC and Voltammetry Study Case with Atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biindole&#8208;Based Monomers and Oligomer Films</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold is studied in two enantiodiscrimination contests: as probes in enantioselective HPLC and as selectors in chiral voltammetry for successful discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid.







Abstract
A family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is studied in cascade in two enantioselection contexts. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.

         <title>Engineered Cyclotides with Potent Broad in Vitro and in Vivo Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ESKAPE kit: A novel engineered cyclotide has effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed high in vivo efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen known to produce chronic lung infection in humans. These findings suggest the possibility of designing novel therapeutics based on the cyclotide scaffold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Camarero et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101438).
