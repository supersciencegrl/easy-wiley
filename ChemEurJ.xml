         <title>First Potassium Fluoroaluminate Ionic Exchanger for Rapid and Selective Removal of Sr2+ with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>90Sr, as a typical artificial radionuclide, poses a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment. The selective removal of this radionuclide from industrial nuclear waste is very necessary for our environment. Here we report a novel potassium fluoroaluminate, K2[(AlF5)H2O], which was synthesized by a simple low&#8208;temperature one&#8208;step method. It adopts a 1D AlF6&#8208;chain structure, which consists of exchangeable potassium ions in between the infinite chains of octahedral Al centers. As a remarkable inorganic ionic exchanger, K2[(AlF5)H2O] has a high chemical stability (resistance of pH= ~3&#8208;12) and thermal stability. It possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104 mL&#183;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of qm= ~120.32 mg&#183;g&#8722;1 for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions. K2[(AlF5)H2O] is the first example of fluoroaluminate ionic exchange materials that can capture Sr2+. This result opens up a new way to design and synthesize inorganic ionic exchangers for the selective removal of Sr2+ ions from radioactive waste water.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction of 1&#8208;Naphthols and Electron&#8208;Rich Phenols with Isatin&#8208;Derived Ketimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New chiral ligands could be obtained by introducing proline moieties and imidazoline moieties to binaphthyl skeletons. The chiral ligands exhibited balanced rigidity and flexibility which could allow the change of the conformations during the reactions on one hand, and could provide sufficient asymmetric induction on the other. The proline moiety could act as a linker connecting the binaphthyl skeletons and the imidazoline moieties as well as a coordinating group for the central metal, and the electronic and steric properties of the imidazoline groups could be carefully fine&#8208;tuned by the use of different substituents. In the presence of Cu(II) catalyst bearing such chiral ligands, aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines provided the desired products with good to excellent yields and up to 99% ee. The reactions showed good scalability, and excellent ee could still be obtained when the reaction was carried out in gram&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>A Study on Auto&#8208;Catalysis and Product Inhibition: A Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction Catalysed within the Cavity of an Octanuclear Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity&#8208;bound guest was studied with 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH 8.6). The rate enhancement of kcat/kuncat was determined to be 23, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto&#8208;catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red&#8208;shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red&#8208;shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4&#8208;nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH 8.6. The red&#8208;shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X&#8208;ray crystallography; and also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene: A Building Block for Design of Macrocycles with Excited State Aromatic Low&#8208;Lying High&#8208;Spin States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) is an unusual isomer of benzene. Motivated by recent synthetic progress to substituted derivatives of this scaffold, we carried out a theoretical and computational analysis with a particular focus on the extent of (anti)aromatic character in the lowest excited states of different multiplicities. We found that the parent DMCB is non&#8208;aromatic in its singlet ground state (S0), lowest triplet state (T1), and lowest singlet excited state (S1), while it is aromatic in its lowest quintet state (Q1) as this state is represented by a triplet multiplicity cyclobutadiene (CBD) ring and two uncoupled same&#8208;spin methylene radicals. Interestingly, the Q1 state, despite having four unpaired electrons, is placed merely 4.8 eV above S0, and there is a corresponding singlet tetraradical 0.16 eV above. The DMCB is potentially a highly useful structural motif for the design of larger molecular entities with interesting optoelectronic properties. Here, we designed macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units, and according to our computations, two of these have low&#8208;lying nonet states (i.e., octaradical states) at energies merely 2.40 and 0.37 eV above their S0 states as a result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromatic character of individual 6&#960;&#8208; and 4&#960;&#8208;electron monocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Bending a Cumulene with Electrons: Stepwise Chemical Reduction and Structural Study of a Tetraaryl[4]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene with cesium metal was explored, and the structural changes stemming from electron acquisition are detailed using X&#8208;ray crystallography. It is found that the [4]cumulene undergoes dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar. The structural deformation is consistent with early theoretical reports&#160; that suggests that the twisting should occur upon reduction of both even and odd [n]cumulenes. The current results, on the other hand, are inconsistent with a previous experimental study of a [3]cumulene in which the predicted twisting is not observed upon reduction . DFT computations help to reveal that the barrier to deformation was significantly lower in a [3]cumulene than a [4]cumulene, allowing the barrier to be overcome in the solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenanthrothiophene&#8208;Triazine Star&#8208;Shaped Discotic Liquid Crystals: Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophilic biphenylthiophene&#8208; and phenanthrothiophene&#8208;triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent&#8217;s polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON&#8208;OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lipophilic biphenylthiophene- and phenanthrothiophene-triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent&#8217;s polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli-responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON-OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron-withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti-counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self-assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen-bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0 mg/mL). Therefore, these star-shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transformations for the Construction of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of asymmetric carbene reactions for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary center have been summarized: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization process.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic carbene reactions have been well documented in the last few decades for the expeditious assembly of chiral molecules with structural diversity. However, the enantioselective construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a challenge in this area. In this review article, two types of asymmetric carbene reactions that beyond cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, and B&#252;chner reaction, have been summarized for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization reaction. Especially, the asymmetric metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation process, which has emerged as a practical and versatile method for the expeditious assembly of complex architectures from readily available chemical resources, is a complementary approach for the expeditious assembly of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.

         <title>Electropolymerization of Preferred&#8208;Oriented Conjugated Microporous Polymer Films for Enhanced Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive.







Abstract
High&#8208;quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP&#8208;based thin films for advanced applications.

         <title>Triplet Energy Transfer Mechanism in Copper Photocatalytic N&#8208; and O&#8208;Methylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the photochemical energy transfer mechanism of hypervalent iodine reagents. When coupled to copper catalysis we achieved successful methylation of a diverse set of N&#8208;heterocycles and (hetero&#8722;)aromatic carboxylic acids. In addition, we could show application of this methodology to more complex active pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic investigations support our observations and provide the basis for future developments.







Abstract
Methylation reactions are chemically simple but challenging to perform under mild and non&#8208;toxic conditions. A photochemical energy transfer strategy was merged with copper catalysis to enable fast reaction times of minutes and broad applicability to N&#8208;heterocycles, (hetero&#8722;)aromatic carboxylic acids, and drug&#8208;like molecules in high yields and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations, using kinetic analysis, aprotic MS, UV/Vis, and luminescence quenching experiments revealed a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism between hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and readily available photosensitizers.

Abstract
Four donor&#8208;acceptor boron difluoride complexes based on the carbazole electron donor and the [1,3,5,2]oxadiazaborinino[3,4&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridine acceptor were designed, synthesized, and systematically spectroscopically investigated in solutions, in dye&#8208;doped polymer films, and in the solid states. The dyes exhibit an intense blue to red solid&#8208;state emission with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 59&#8201;% in pure dye samples and 86&#8201;% in poly(methyl methacrylate) films. All boron complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reversible mechanofluorochromism. The optical properties of these dyes and their solid state luminescence can be tuned by substitution pattern, i.&#8201;e., the substituents at the naphthyridine unit. Exchange of CH3&#8208; for CF3&#8208;groups does not only increase the intramolecular charge transfer character, but also provides a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of B&#8592;N Adducts by the Amine&#8208;Facilitated Trimerization of the Phenylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical synthesis of boroxine&#8208;amine adducts was monitored by in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ PXRD. Amine is exchanged in 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts by a stronger amine. Experimental and DFT data show that both 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 adducts (with same or different amines) form if pKa(amine)&gt;8, that was evidenced by the first crystal structure with two different amines (DMAP and piperidine) bound to one boroxine.







Abstract
Stable boroxine&#8208;amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically&#8208;induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1H&#8208;pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). In&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, ex&#8208;situ PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 or 6&#8201;:&#8201;1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 H&#8208;bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemical synthesis of boroxine-amine adducts was monitored by &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; Raman spectroscopy and &lt;i&gt;ex-situ&lt;/i&gt; PXRD. Amine is exchanged in 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts by a stronger amine. Experimental and DFT data show that both 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 adducts (with same or different amines) form if p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(amine)&amp;gt;8, that was evidenced by the first crystal structure with two different amines (DMAP and piperidine) bound to one boroxine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable boroxine-amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically-induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;-bipyridine). &lt;i&gt;In-situ&lt;/i&gt; Raman monitoring, &lt;i&gt;ex-situ&lt;/i&gt; PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 or 6&#8201;:&#8201;1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 H-bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;-bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiropyran&#8208;Based Photoisomerizable &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid for Membrane&#8208;Active Peptide Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyran&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;amino acid was carefully designed for the synthesis of photocontrollable bioactive peptides. Dramatic changes in structure and polarity occurring upon light exposure or dark adaptation of the spiropyran side chain can cause changes in the behavior of peptides in lipid membranes and living cells, as demonstrated on spiropyran&#8208;containing analogs of the membrane&#8208;active peptide BP100 (KKLFKKILKYL&#8208;NH2).







Abstract
Photoisomerizable peptides are promising drug candidates in photopharmacology. While azobenzene&#8208; and diarylethene&#8208;containing photoisomerizable peptides have already demonstrated their potential in this regard, reports on the use of spiropyrans to photoregulate bioactive peptides are still scarce. This work focuses on the design and synthesis of a spiropyran&#8208;derived amino acid, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(6'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1',3',3'&#8208;trimethylspiro&#8208;[2H&#8208;1&#8208;benzopyran&#8208;2,2'&#8208;indolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl])propanoic acid, which is suitable for the preparation of photoisomerizable peptides. The utility of this amino acid is demonstrated by incorporating it into the backbone of BP100, a known membrane&#8208;active peptide, and by examining the photoregulation of the membrane perturbation by the spiropyran&#8208;containing peptides. The toxicity of the peptides (against the plant cell line BY&#8208;2), their bacteriotoxicity (E.&#8197;coli), and actin&#8211;auxin oscillator modulation ability were shown to be significantly dependent on the photoisomeric state of the spiropyran unit.

         <title>Metal&#8208;(Acyclic Diaminocarbene) Complexes Demonstrate Nanomolar Antiproliferative Activity against Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrolytically stable palladium and platinum diaminocarbene complexes exhibit nanomolar antiproliferative activity and high selectivity for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. Our lead drug candidate surpasses cisplatin by 300 times in vitro and exhibits superior efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice. The critical role of interference with metabolic processes and redox homeostasis in achieving excellent selectivity for cancer cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
Hydrolytically stable PdII and PtII complexes supported by acyclic diaminocarbene ligands represent a novel class of structural organometallic anticancer agents exhibiting nanomolar antiproliferative activity in a panel of cancer cell lines (IC50 0.07&#8211;0.81&#8197;&#956;M) and up to 300&#8208;fold selectivity for cancer cells over normal primary fibroblasts. The lead drug candidate was 300 times more potent than cisplatin in&#8197;vitro and showed higher efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice.

Hydrogen thermal reduction process removed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the surface of Super&#8197;P, thereby weakening interface side reactions with sulfide benefits Li&#8208;ion migration. Only 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% reduced Super&#8197;P based ASSLBs exhibited better reversible capacity of 180.2&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and high capacity retention of 81.8&#8201;% after 40&#8197;cycles, and 130.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 64.6&#8201;% for Super&#8197;P.







Abstract
Conductive additives are of great importance for the adequate utilization of active materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries by establishing conductive networks in the composite cathode. However, it usually causes severe interfacial side reactions with solid electrolytes, especially sulfide electrolytes, leading to sluggish ion transportation and accelerated performance degradation. Herein, a simple hydrogen thermal reduction process is proposed on a commonly used conductive additive Super&#8197;P, which effectively removes the surface oxygen functional groups and weakens the interfacial side reactions with sulfide. With a small amount of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% reduced Super&#8197;P, ASSLBs demonstrates a competitive capacity of 180.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than the 130.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of untreated Super&#8197;P. Impressively, reduced Super&#8197;P based ASSLBs also exhibit a higher capacity retention of 81.8&#8201;% than 64.6&#8201;% of untreated Super&#8197;P. The cathode interfacial chemical evolutions reveal that reduced Super&#8197;P could effectively alleviate the side reactions of sulfide. Reduced Super&#8197;P shows better reversible capacity compared to reduced carbon nanofiber with almost no loss of capacity retention, due to its more complete conductive network. Our results highlight the importance of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups for conductive additives, lightening the prospect of low&#8208;cost 0D conductive additives for practical ASSLBs.

         <title>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;Phenalenyls: the Yin and Yang of Heteroatom&#8208;doped&#160;&#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;doped phenalenyls are isoelectronic to phenalenyl anions and cations, respectively. They represent a pair of complementary molecules that have essentially identical structures but opposite properties as electron donors and acceptors. The NBN&#8208;phenalenyls 1&#8722;4 considered here were prepared from N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron&#8208;containing building blocks (i.e., BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1), p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4B(OH)2 (2), C6H5B(OH)2 (3), or MesBCl2/iPr2NEt (4)). Treatment of 1 with 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H2Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative 5. The BNB&#8208;phenalenyl 6 was synthesized from 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl&#8208;bridged diborane(6), PhNH2, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of 1, 4, and 5 originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl fragments, while that of 2 is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl to the p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4 fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &#952; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound 3 emits mainly from a less polar LE (&#952; &gt; 55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&#952; &lt; 55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used. An equimolar aggregate of the NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;phenalenyls 3 and 6 (in THF/H2O) shows a distinct red&#8208;shifted emission compared to that of the individual components, which originates from an intermolecular CT state.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NBN- and BNB-doped phenalenyls are isoelectronic to phenalenyl anions and cations, respectively. They represent a pair of complementary molecules that have essentially identical structures but opposite properties as electron donors and acceptors. The NBN-phenalenyls 1&#8722;4 considered here were prepared from N,N&#8217;-dimethyl-1,8-diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron-containing building blocks (i.e., BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1), p-CF3-C6H4B(OH)2 (2), C6H5B(OH)2 (3), or MesBCl2/iPr2NEt (4)). Treatment of 1 with 4-Me2N-2,6-Me2-C6H2Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative 5. The BNB-phenalenyl 6 was synthesized from 1,8-naphthalenediyl-bridged diborane(6), PhNH2, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of 1, 4, and 5 originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN-phenalenyl fragments, while that of 2 is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN-phenalenyl to the p-CF3-C6H4 fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &#952; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound 3 emits mainly from a less polar LE (&#952; &amp;gt; 55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&#952; &amp;lt; 55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used.

         <title>A Chiral&#160;[2 + 3]&#160;Covalent Organic Cage Based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [2 + 3] chiral covalent organic cage is produced through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach by mixing two readily available building units, viz. an enantiopure 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diformyl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL compound (A) with a triamino spacer (B). The two enantiomeric (R,R,R) and (S,S,S) forms of the cage&#160;C&#160;are produced nearly quantitatively thanks to the reversibility of the imine linkage. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of cage (S,S,S)&#8208;C&#160;highlights that the six OH functions of the BINOL fragments are positioned inside the cage cavity. Upon reduction of the imine bonds of cage&#160;C, the amine cage&#160;D&#160;is obtained. The ability of the cage&#160;D&#160;to host the&#160;1&#8208;phenylethylammonium cation (EH+) as a guest&#160;is evaluated through UV, CD and DOSY NMR studies. A higher binding constant for (R)&#8208;EH+&#160;cation (Ka = 1.7 106&#160;&#177; 10 % M&#8208;1)&#160;related to (S)&#8208;EH+&#160;(Ka = 0.9 106&#160;&#177; 10 % M&#8208;1)&#160;is determined in the presence of the (R,R,R)&#8208;D&#160;cage. This enantiopreference is in close agreement with molecular dynamics simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Phenyl Transfer from a Boronate to Lithium in the Gas Phase Reveals Crucial Role of Solvation in Transmetalations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; (pin = pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids. Instead, the individual coordination states and their changes over the course of the reaction must be taken into account.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type Reaction of Vinyl Iodide&#8722;Carbonyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insertion of carbonyl into C(sp2)&#8211;Pd(II) &#963;&#8208;bond (Grignard&#8208;type addition) was not established until the 1990s. While this elemental reaction has been well explored since then, its application in Pd(0) asymmetric catalysis remain elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8211;carbonyl in the presence of HCO2H additive, affording cyclic allylic alcohol with good to excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested that besides serving as an efficient reductant, HCO2H is also capable of facilitating protonation of the involved secondary alkoxyl&#8208;Pd(II), thus completely suppressing the &#946;&#8208;H elimination. Moreover, no KIE was found in the competing reaction between vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde and 1&#8208;deuterated one, demonstrating the facile step of aldehyde insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Complex of the Parent Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diatomic molecule PH is very reactive, and it serves as the parent compound for phosphinidenes featuring a monovalent phosphorus atom. Herein, we report the characterization and reactivity of a rare hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex of PH. Specifically, the molecular complex between PH and HCl has been generated by photolysis of chlorophosphine (H2PCl) at 254 nm in a solid Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K. The IR spectrum of the complex HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;HCl and quantum chemical calculations at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/haTZ level consistently prove that the phosphorus atom acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor with a binding energy (D0) of &#8211;0.6 kcal mol&#8722;1. In line with the observed absorption at 341 nm for the binary complex, the triplet phosphinidene PH undergoes prototype H&#8722;Cl bond insertion by reformation of H2PCl upon photoexcitation at 365 nm. However, this hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is unstable in the presence of N2 and HCl, as both molecules prefers stronger interactions with HCl than PH in the observed complexes HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;HCl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N2 and HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;2HCl.</dc:description>

         <title>Caged Dexamethasone to Photo&#8208;control the Development of Embryos through Activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily synthesized caged inducer for the glucocorticoid receptor is demonstrated to spatially and temporally control gene&#8208;expression and development in two well&#8208;known vertebrate models: Zebrafish and Xenopus. Biologically orthogonal to the ones for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, it brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.







Abstract
Efficient tools for controlling molecular functions with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution are much in demand to investigate biological processes in living systems. Here we report an easily synthesized caged dexamethasone for photo&#8208;activating cytoplasmic proteins fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the dark, it is stable in&#8197;vitro as well as in&#8197;vivo in both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus sp, two significant models of vertebrates. In contrast, it liberates dexamethasone upon UV illumination, which has been harnessed to interfere with developmental steps in embryos of these animals. Interestingly, this new system is biologically orthogonal to the one for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, which brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT study of Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation of ketones with diazo compounds revealed a new coordination mode of substrates which was rationalized by the trans influence. The origin of stereo&#8208;selectivity was explored based on the coordination mode. A promising new strategy to adjust stereo&#8208;selectivity by trans influence was proposed.







Abstract
Asymmetric one&#8208;carbon homologation or ring expansion of ketones with formal insertion of carbene intermediate, is a challenging but useful strategy to construct a complex skeleton. Sc(III) and chiral ligands have been employed in this regard. However, due to flexible conformations and a variety of stereo models, the origin of stereochemistry remains ambiguous. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the interactions that control the stereoselectivity of a Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation. The trans influence of counterions was found to affect the coordination mode of ketone to Sc(III), and consequently affect the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Recent Advances in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reactions of 1,n&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction provided a powerful method for the preparation of various chiral compounds containing an allylic moiety. Chiral palladium/phosphine complex efficiently promoted a wide range of difunctionalization of 1,n&#8208;dienes (n=2&#8211;4) for constructing C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N) bond simultaneously. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and highlights the significant achievements.







Abstract
Transition&#8211;metal catalyzed tandem asymmetric reactions were powerful tools to access various chiral compounds. Many strategies have been developed for the coupling of 1,n&#8208;dienes with aryl halides via a tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost process. However, the control of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemistry remains a challenging task. This minireview details the recent advances in the field of asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions catalyzed by palladium complex, which have opened new opportunities and expanded our understanding in this area of research in recent years.

         <title>Mesoporous Metal nanomaterials: Developments and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept, we primarily summarized the design and synthetic strategies of mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs), aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. MPMNs successfully make up for the unsatisfactory of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials by exposing more active sites and providing channels through interconnected pores for efficient mass transfer.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs) are pivotal in nanotechnology, especially in electrochemical applications, due to their unique structure. Unlike traditional nanomaterials, MPMNs possess hierarchical and mesoporous characteristics, providing more active sites for improved mass and electron transfer. This distinctive composition offers dual benefits, enhancing activity, stability, and selectivity for specific reactions. The intricate architecture, featuring interconnected pores, amplifies surface area, ensuring efficient use of active sites and boosting reactivity in electrocatalytic processes. Additionally, the mesoporous nature promotes superior diffusion kinetics, facilitating better transport of reactants and products. This intricate interplay of structural elements contributes not only to the increased efficiency of electrochemical reactions but also to the extended durability of MPMNs during prolonged usage. This concept focus on the synthesis and design strategies of MPMNs, aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. The synergy resulting from these advancements not only accentuates the intrinsic properties of MPMNs but also broadens their scope for practical implementation in emerging fields of electrochemistry.

         <title>Photosensitizers Enable the Formation of Biphenyls with UV&#8208;LEDs and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective synthesis of biphenyls, which are economically important pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and liquid crystals, is a challenging task. Current methods rely on metal&#8208;dependent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which unfortunately require the use of harmful halogenated aryls and heavy metal catalysts that are toxic and difficult to remove from the final products. Recently, we have circumvented these problems by developing a metal&#8208;free and broadly applicable photochemical method for biphenyl synthesis using UV&#8208;C light, called photosplicing. Here we present an improved method using photosensitizers in combination with UV&#8208;B, UVA light, or sunlight. Using a high&#8208;precision flow reactor with deep&#8208;UV LEDs, we investigated the ability of commonly available organic photosensitizers to enhance the photosplicing reaction and identified a number of suitable photosensitizers with the required triplet energy. This method allows for easy batch synthesis of biaryls in borosilicate glassware and paves the way for their large&#8208;scale production without the need for flow reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Adduct Formation of a Bidentate Boron Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bidentate boron Lewis acid based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylan&#173;thracene has been studied in detail with respect to its adduct formation with diamines and diphosphanes of different linker lengths between the donor functions. A clear correlation between the linker length of the bifunctional base and the formation of 1:1 adducts, 1:2 adducts or oligomers was found. The adducts were characterized in solution by NMR titration experiments and structurally by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, adduct formation and competition experiments of the host system with ZR3 (Z = N, P; R = H, Me) demonstrated the generally higher stability of alkylphosphane adducts compared to alkylamine adducts with boron functions. The results provide a gene&#173;ral insight into the adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with guests of different sizes as well as the differences in stability between borane&#8208;amine and borane&#8208;phosphane adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Bench&#8208;Stable Iron Precatalyst for Building Arene and Triazine Rings by [2+2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new [2+2+2] cycloaddition procedure relying on the use of an air&#8208;stable iron precatalyst is described, which allows the construction of aromatic and nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroaromatic rings in green solvents and mild conditions. Cycloadditions and cross&#8208;cycloadditions between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes are reported, with a broad functional tolerance, leading to a variety of functionalizable scaffolds.







Abstract
We report an efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition procedure leading to the construction of (hetero)aromatic rings by alkyne [2+2+2] cycloisomerization. This method relies on the use of an air&#8208;stable (N,N)Fe(II) precursor easily prepared from a commercially available ligand derived from 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, reduced in&#8197;situ into a catalytically active non&#8208;innocent (N,N &#8901;&#8722;)2Fe(II) species. This system displays a large scope application, operates under mild conditions and at low catalytic charges (25 cycloadducts formed, up to 1.5&#8197;mol% catalyst). Moreover, this method also enables access to 29 cycloadducts by cross&#8208;cycloisomerization between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes in near&#8208;equimolar conditions. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines can also be prepared with this procedure starting from the corresponding cyanamides. Scale&#8208;up reactions and post&#8208;functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.

         <title>Interaction of the Immune System TIM&#8208;3 Protein with a Model Cellular Membrane Containing Phosphatidyl&#8208;Serine Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report molecular modeling and simulation of the specific recognition of Phosphatidyl serine&#8211;containing lipids and TIM&#8208;3 immune system agent, which is particularly present in natural killer and T&#8208;cells. We also identify the thermodynamic of the interaction process, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics.







Abstract
T cell transmembrane, Immunoglobulin, and Mucin (TIM) are important immune system proteins which are especially present in T&#8208;cells and regulated the immune system by sensing cell engulfment and apoptotic processes. Their role is exerted by the capacity to detect the presence of phosphatidyl&#8211;serine lipid polar head in the outer leaflet of cellular membranes (correlated with apoptosis). In this contribution by using equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation we unravel the molecular bases and the thermodynamics of TIM, and in particular TIM&#8208;3, interaction with phosphatidyl serine in a lipid bilayer. Since TIM&#8208;3 deregulation is an important factor of pro&#8208;oncogenic tumor micro&#8208;environment understanding its functioning at a molecular level may pave the way to the development of original immunotherapeutic approaches.

         <title>Impact of the Methylene Bridge Substitution in Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Mn(I) Catalyst for Ketone Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridge substituent matters: the incorporation of phenyl group into the methylene bridge of bidentate phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand leads to significant increase of catalytic performance for the corresponding Mn(I) complex. Mechanistic studies revealed that this effect was caused by stabilization of key metal intermediates including a highly reactive anionic hydride complex due to more efficient negative charge delocalization.







Abstract
Systematic modification of the chelating NHC&#8208;phosphine ligand (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) in highly efficient ketone hydrogenation Mn(I) catalyst fac&#8208;[(Ph2PCH2NHC)Mn(CO)3Br] has been performed and the catalytic activity of the resulting complexes was evaluated using acetophenone as a benchmark substrate. While the variation of phosphine and NHC moieties led to inferior results than for a parent system, the incorporation of a phenyl substituent into the ligand methylene bridge improved catalytic performance by ca. 3 times providing maximal TON values in the range of 15000&#8211;20000. Mechanistic investigation combining experimental and computational studies allowed to rationalize this beneficial effect as an enhanced stabilization of reaction intermediates including anionic hydride species fac&#8208;[(Ph2PC(Ph)NHC)Mn(CO)3H]&#8722; playing a crucial role in the hydrogenation process. These results highlight the interest of such carbon bridge substitution strategy being rarely employed in the design of chemically non&#8208;innocent ligands.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin and Mediated Uptake of Fe(III) into the Green Seaweed Ulva</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin was stereoselectively synthesized by implementing an IrI&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective polyene cyclization. A TMS group tracelessly directed the regioselectivity. (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin is secreted by bacteria associated with the green seaweed Ulva and forms a stable 2:1 FeIII complex that the algae take up, selectively promoting their massive development. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Wichard. H.&#8208;D. Arndt and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304007). Background picture: Seaphotoart/Alamy Stock Foto.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The algal morphogen&lt;/b&gt; (&#8722;)-thallusin was stereoselectively synthesized by implementing an Ir&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed enantioselective polyene cyclization. A TMS group tracelessly directed the regioselectivity. (&#8722;)-Thallusin is secreted by bacteria associated with the green seaweed &lt;i&gt;Ulva&lt;/i&gt; and forms a stable 2:1 Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex that the algae take up, selectively promoting their massive development.

         <title>Stability of the Protactinium(V) Mono&#8208;oxo Cation Probed by First&#8208;Principle Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, protactinium(V) can exist as a mono&#8208;oxo PaO3+ cation or a Pa5+, a unique feature along the actinide series. The relative stability of these two species has been explored by relativistic correlated quantum chemical methods. The equilibrium graphic highlights that ligands positioned to the right enhance the formation of a Pa mono&#8208;oxo triple bond in the aqueous phase. In contrast, those on the left destabilize this bond making the Pa5+ more stable. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Vallet and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304068). The cover design is credited to the graphic designer Ihsan Obeid.

         <title>TiO2/Loofah&#8211;Halloysite Bio&#8211;Hybrid Composites as Efficient Systems for VOCs Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an easy and environmentally friendly synthesis of TiO2/loofah&#8211;halloysite composite from low&#8211;cost and environmentally friendly materials such as loofah fibers and halloysite nanotubes. The material has been extensively characterized. The co&#8211;presence of loofah, halloysite nanotubes, and titanium dioxide allowed a synergistic effect for application in the photooxidation of VOCs, such as toluene and ethanol.







Abstract
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), recognized as hazardous air contaminants, prompt the exploration of sustainable air purification methods. Solar photocatalytic oxidation emerges as a promising solution, utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts like titanium dioxide (TiO2). However, the raw material crisis necessitates reduced TiO2 usage, leading to investigations into TiO2 modification techniques. The study introduces a novel approach by employing natural fibers, specifically loofah sponge, as a TiO2 support. This method aims to maintain photocatalytic activity while minimizing TiO2 content. The article explores using halloysite, a natural clay mineral, as a supportive material, enhancing mechanical strength and adsorption properties. The resulting TiO2/loofah&#8211;halloysite composites are evaluated for their efficacy in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and ethanol, chosen as representative VOCs. The conversion of toluene and ethanol on the composite was 88&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively, with high selectivity toward CO2. In addition to its high performance, the bio&#8211;composite was stable for several conversion cycles, keeping the conversion activity unchanged. The study contributes to developing green hybrid materials for VOC removal, showcasing potential applications across industries.

         <title>Accessing Rare &#945;&#8208;Heterocyclic Aziridines via Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;catalyzed Michael Addition/Annulation: Scope, Limitations, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of rare 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. Our approach utilizes an inherent degradation of 1,2&#8208;chloroamines in the presence of trace acid, followed by annulation to give a diverse array of cis&#8208;aziridines which are not captured by alternative synthetic methodologies. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic insights into the selectivity are presented.







Abstract
We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition of anilines to trisubstituted heterocyclic chloroalkenes provides an intermediate 1,2&#8208;chloroamine. Diastereocontrol was found to vary significantly with solvent selection, with computational modelling confirming selective, spontaneous fragmentation in the presence of trace acids, proceeding through a pseudo&#8208;cyclic, protonated intermediate and transition state. These chloroamines can then be converted to the aziridine by treatment with LiHMDS with high stereochemical fidelity. This solvent&#8208;induced stereochemical enrichment thereby enables an efficient route to rare cis&#8208;aziridines with high dr. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic origins of selectivity are also presented.

         <title>Access to a peri&#8208;Annulated Aluminium Compound via C&#8722;H Bond Activation by a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Aluminylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I with a catalytic amount the NHC (IMe4) has been shown to afford the peri&#8208;annulated compound 4 as a colorless crystalline solid. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene 3 into the C&#8722;H bonds of HCMe2 groups. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3 while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
Carbocyclic aluminium halides [(ADC)AlX2]2 (2&#8208;X) (X=F, Cl, and I) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) framework are prepared as crystalline solids by dehydrohalogenations of the alane [(ADC)AlH2]2 (1). KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I affords the peri&#8208;annulated Al(III) compound [(ADCH)AlH]2 (4) (ADCH=PhC{N(Dipp)C2(DippH)N}, DippH=2&#8208;iPr,6&#8208;(Me2C)C6H3)) as a colorless crystalline solid in 76&#8201;% yield. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene species [(ADC)Al]2 (3) into the methine C&#8722;H bond of HCMe2 group. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3, while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61&#8197;kcal/mol. Compounds 2&#8208;F, 2&#8208;Cl, 2&#8208;I, and 4 have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their solid&#8208;state molecular structures have been established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

&lt;p&gt;Carbocyclic aluminium halides [(ADC)AlX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-X) (X=F, Cl, and I) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Dipp = 2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) framework are prepared as crystalline solids by dehydrohalogenations of the alane [(ADC)AlH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; reduction of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-I affords the &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-annulated Al(III) compound [(ADC&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;)AlH]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) (ADC&lt;sup&gt;H=&lt;/sup&gt;PhC{N(Dipp)C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Dipp&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;)N}, Dipp&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;=2-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr,6-(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)) as a colorless crystalline solid in 76&#8201;% yield. The formation of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis-aluminylene species [(ADC)Al]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) into the methine C&#8722;H bond of HCMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. Calculations predict singlet ground state for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, while the conversion of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; into &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is thermodynamically favored by 61&#8197;kcal/mol. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-F, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-Cl, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-I, and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their solid-state molecular structures have been established by single crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Unveiling the structure of new pertechnetate derivatives: a journey through 1d and 2d supramolecular polymer formation dictated by matere bonds in combination with hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
In this manuscript we evaluate the X&#8208;ray structure of five new pertechnetate derivatives of general formula [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], M=Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn (compounds 1&#8211;5) and one perrhenate compound Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 (6). In these complexes the metal center exhibits an octahedral coordination with the pertechnetate units as axial ligands. All compounds exhibit the formation of directional Tc&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Matere bonds (MaBs) that propagate the [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], into 1D supramolecular polymers in the solid state. Such 1D polymers are linked, generating 2D layers, by combining additional MaBs and hydrogen bonds (HBs). Such concurrent motifs have been analyzed theoretically, suggesting the noncovalent &#963;&#8208;hole nature of the MaBs. The interaction energies range from weak (~ &#8722;2&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaBs to strong (~ &#8722;30&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaB+HB assemblies, where HB dominates. In case of M=Zn, the corresponding perrhenate Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 complex, has been also synthesized for comparison purposes, resulting in the formation of an isostructural X&#8208;ray structure, corroborating the structure&#8208;directing role of Matere bonds.

         <title>para&#8208;Phenylenediamine Dimer as a Redox&#8208;Active Guest for Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active components are highly valuable in the construction of molecular devices. We combined two p&#8208;phenylenediamines (p&#8208;PDA) with a biphenyl (BiPhe) unit to prepare a supramolecular guest 4 consisting of three binding sites for cucurbit[7/8]uril (CBn) and/or cyclodextrins (CD). Supramolecular properties of 4 were investigated using NMR, UV&#8208;vis, mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our analysis revealed that 4 forms higher&#8208;order host&#8211;guest complexes, wherein a CD unit occupies the central BiPhe site, secured by two CBn units at the terminal p&#8208;PDA sites. Additionally, 1:1 complexes with &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CD, a 1:2 complex with &#947;&#8208;CD and 2:1 complexes with CB7 and CB8 were identified. Through UV&#8208;vis and cyclic voltammetry, redox processes leading to the formation of a stable, deep blue dication diradical of 4 are elucidated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that CB7 selectively protects oxidised 4 from reduction in the presence of a reducing agent. The supramolecular and redox properties of the structural motif represented by 4 render it an interesting candidate for the construction of supramolecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application of Colloidal and Supported Mn Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal and supported manganese nanoparticles were synthesized following an organometallic approach and applied in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of aldehydes and ketones. Reaction parameters for the preparation of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) were optimized to yield small (2&#8208;2.5 nm) and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Manganese NPs were further immobilized on an imidazolium&#8208;based supported ionic phase (SILP) and characterized to evaluate NP size, metal loading, and oxidation states. Oxidation of the Mn NPs by the support was observed resulting in an average formal oxidation state of +2.5. The MnOx@SILP material showed promising performance in the CTH of aldehydes and ketones using 2&#8208;propanol as a hydrogen donor, outperforming previously reported Mn NPs&#8208;based CTH catalysts in terms of metal loading&#8208;normalized turnover numbers. Interestingly, MnOx@SILP were found to lose activity upon air exposure, which correlates with an additional increase in the average oxidation state of Mn as revealed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The number of crystal structures of pertechnetates derived from aqueous solutions has been expanded from seven to over 30. We report the conversion of NH4TcO4 to aqueous HTcO4 via acidic cation exchange. This is followed by the synthesis and structural elucidation of pertechnetate salts of alkaline earth (AE), transition metal (TM) and lanthanoids (Ln) elements. Various degrees of hydration and coordination are discussed. Where possible, a comparison with the perrhenate homologues is made. The described syntheses and materials may be used as novel starting materials for extended technetium research.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Binuclear Copper(I) Alkynyl Complexes with Cuprophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been conceived to be promising candidates for display and lighting applications because of their multifarious structures and strong photoluminescence. Herein a string of binuclear Cu(I) complexes bearing pronounced cuprophilic interactions have been designed and synthesized. [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Ph)2] (1a) and [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;PPXZ)2] (1b) display photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 67% in doped films and solid states via TADF and exhibit reversible bicolor luminescence switching upon mechanical stimuli. Computational studies manifest that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer predominant transitions ensure a small energy splitting (&#916;EST) between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and cuprophilic interactions promote the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), favoring the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This study provides a new strategy for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;based TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments of Nontraditional Single&#8208;Molecule Toroics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule toroics (SMTs), are defined as a type of molecules with toroidal arrangement of magnetic moment associated with bi&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic ground states, making them promising candidates for high&#8208;density information storage and the development of molecule based multiferroic materials with linear magneto&#8211;electric coupling and multiferroic behavior. The design and synthesis of SMTs by arranging the magnetic anisotropy axis in a circular pattern at the molecular level has been of great interest to scientists for last two decades since the first detection of the SMT behavior in the seminal Dy3 molecules. DyIII ion has long been the ideal candidate for constructing SMTs due to its Kramer ion nature as well as high anisotropy. Nevertheless, other LnIII ions such as TbIII and HoIII ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8208;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful to design novel SMTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(vinyl chloride) Dechlorination Catalyzed by Zirconium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic amidozirconocene catalyst is shown to dechlorinate poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) under mild conditions in the presence of triethylsilane as a hydrogen donor. PVC additives containing carbonyl functional groups (e.&#8201;g. phthalates, poly(vinyl acetate)) underwent complete hydrosilylation. A procedure is reported for the deconvolution of catalyst poisoning effects by PVC additives.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl chloride) undergoes dechlorination in the presence of triethylsilane (Et3SiH) and a catalytic amount of [Cp2Zr(NPh2)][CH3B(C6F5)3] (1&#8201;b) at 40&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, with up to 91&#8201;% efficiency. Stoichiometric reactivity studies conducted on cyclohexyl chloride as a model suggest that 1&#8201;b dechlorinates PVC by initial chloride abstraction, followed by hydride transfer to the cationic PVC chain from Et3SiH. Consumer items such as pipe fitting, vinyl disc or electric cable insulation undergo either dechlorination or hydrosilylation of the carbonyl&#8208;containing copolymer (polyvinyl acetate) or plasticizer (phthalate).

         <title>Molybdenum(0)&#8208;Tricarbonyl Complex Supported by an Azacalix&#8208;pyridine Ligand: Synthesis, Characterization, Surface Deposition and Conversion to a Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Trioxo Complex with O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of a molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an azacalixpyridine ligand. This complex can activate CO and reacts with dioxygen (O2) in solution, in the solid state and on surfaces to form a molybdenum(VI) trioxo complex which mediates O&#8208;transfer from dioxygen to external substrates.







Abstract
Adsorption of metal&#8208;organic complexes on metallic surfaces to produce well&#8208;defined single site catalysts is a novel approach combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To avoid the &#8220;surface trans&#8208;effect&#8221; a dome&#8208;shaped molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an tolylazacalix[3](2,6)pyridine ligand is synthesized. This vacuum&#8208;evaporable complex both activates CO and reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form a Mo(VI) trioxo complex which in turn is capable of catalytically mediating oxygen transfer. The molybdenum tricarbonyl&#8208; and trioxo complexes are investigated in the solid state, in homogeneous solution and on noble metal surfaces (Cu, Au) employing a range of spectroscopic and analytical methods.

         <title>Electrochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Alkyl Alkenesulfonates using Styrenes, SO2 and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first of its kind electrochemical approach for the direct synthesis of alkyl alkenesulfonates using styrenes, SO2 stock solution and alcohols was developed. The reaction features the in&#8208;situ generation of a monoalkylsulfite species with subsequent radical addition to an anodically oxidized styrene substrate. The applicability of the protocol was demonstrated with a broad scope as well as a gram&#8208;scale reaction.







Abstract
A novel electrochemical approach to access alkyl alkenesulfonates via a multicomponent reaction was developed. The metal&#8208;free method features easy&#8208;to&#8208;use SO2 stock solution forming monoalkylsulfites from alcohols with an auxiliary base in&#8208;situ. These intermediates serve a dual role as starting materials and as supporting electrolyte enabling conductivity. Anodic oxidation of the substrate styrene, radical addition of these monoalkylsulfites and consecutive second oxidation and deprotonation preserve the double bond and form alkyl &#946;&#8208;styrenesulfonates in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. The feasibility of this electrosynthetic method is demonstrated in 44 examples with yields up to 81&#8201;%, employing various styrenes and related substrates as well as a diverse set of alcohols. A gram&#8208;scale experiment underlines the applicability of this process, which uses inexpensive and readily available electrode materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on &#955;5&#8208;Phosphinine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive blue &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are newly designed and developed. Among these, methylester&#8208;containing CO2Me&#8208;CHO exhibites very high photoluminescent quantum yield of 94&#8201;%, and external quantum efficiency of 4.18&#8201;% in OLED.







Abstract
Although &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are known as a promising class of blue fluorescent emitters, those photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values have been reached up to 92&#8201;%, however, only a few examples have been explored as an emitter for blue organic light&#8208;emitting device (OLED), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) has been below 2.4&#8201;% so far. In this study, we newly developed two types of blue &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives namely CN&#8208;COCF3 and CO2Me&#8208;CHO, and investigated the photophysical properties in the solid states. The photophysical analyses in solid state films suggested that the strong electron&#8208;accepting nature of these &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives caused the inferior PLQY values, and the exciplex formation with the host and neighboring materials should be avoided to improve the device efficiency. By choosing suitable host and neighboring materials with deep ionization potentials, we successfully realized efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs with EQE of over 4&#8201;% and CIE (0.14, 0.18). This is among the best in &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;based blue OLEDs so far.

&lt;p&gt;Highly emissive blue &#955;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine derivatives are newly designed and developed. Among these, methylester-containing &lt;b&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me-CHO&lt;/b&gt; exhibites very high photoluminescent quantum yield of 94&#8201;%, and external quantum efficiency of 4.18&#8201;% in OLED.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &#955;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine derivatives are known as a promising class of blue fluorescent emitters, those photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values have been reached up to 92&#8201;%, however, only a few examples have been explored as an emitter for blue organic light-emitting device (OLED), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) has been below 2.4&#8201;% so far. In this study, we newly developed two types of blue &#955;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine derivatives namely &lt;b&gt;CN-COCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me-CHO&lt;/b&gt;, and investigated the photophysical properties in the solid states. The photophysical analyses in solid state films suggested that the strong electron-accepting nature of these &#955;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine derivatives caused the inferior PLQY values, and the exciplex formation with the host and neighboring materials should be avoided to improve the device efficiency. By choosing suitable host and neighboring materials with deep ionization potentials, we successfully realized efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs with EQE of over 4&#8201;% and CIE (0.14, 0.18). This is among the best in &#955;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine-based blue OLEDs so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This study describes the investigation of the conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0)&#8208;tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI)&#8208;trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) in detail with different spectroscopic and analytical methods. The reaction takes place in solution, in solid state and as well on noble metal surface and is accelerated by exposure to light. The experimentally findings can be explained by DFT calculation and in sum a reaction mechanism is derived.







Abstract
The conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0) tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI) trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) is investigated in homogeneous solution and in a molecular film adsorbed on Au(111) using a variety of spectroscopic and analytical methods. These studies in particular show that the dome&#8208;shaped carbonyl complex adsorbed on the metal surface has the ability to bind and activate gaseous oxygen, overcoming the so&#8208;called surface trans&#8208;effect. Furthermore, the rate of the conversion dramatically increases by irradiation with light. This observation is explained with the help of complementary DFT calculations and attributed to two different pathways, a thermal and a photochemical one. Based on the experimental and theoretical findings, a molecular mechanism for the conversion of the carbonyl to the oxo complex is derived.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and Trifluoromethoxy Sulfur Pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) &#8211; Two Gaseous Sulfur(VI) Compounds with Insulating Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the great need for action to combat climate change, the replacement of the very potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as a dielectric is indispensable. The gases trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) offer better insulation properties than SF6, but are more easily degradable, which makes their use as dielectrics more environmentally friendly.







Abstract
In this work, we analyzed trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) regarding their potential use as dielectrics by investigating some of their intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Both compounds show a higher breakdown voltage than SF6 with averaged relative breakdown voltages of 1.3&#177;0.2 for CF3OSO2F and 1.4&#177;0.2 for CF3OSF5 compared to SF6 with 1.0. Like the dielectric (CF3)2CFCN, both compounds decompose during the breakdown process. The decomposition products were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and GCIR methods. Furthermore, the molecular structures of both gaseous compounds CF3OSO2F and CF3OSF5 have been determined by in&#8197;situ crystallization, and their physical properties were determined as well.

         <title>Selective Manipulation of Well&#8208;Defined Trinuclear Pd(II)&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trinuclear palladium acetate undergoes selective two&#8208; or four&#8208;fold acetate exchange with tridentate donor&#8208;appended aminophenol ligands to afford well&#8208;defined Pd3 platforms. The overall structure and composition for the bisligated species depends on the ligand used. Initial follow&#8208;up ligand exchange chemistry with some of these Pd3&#8208;species underlines the structural integrity of the Pd3 core.







Abstract
Several strategies are available to design well&#8208;defined multimetallic molecular entities bearing functional ligands. Substoichiometric exchange reactions in the coordination sphere of pre&#8208;existing multinuclear precursors are relatively underexploited in this context. Palladium(II) acetate is not a mononuclear compound in the solid state but rather exists as a trimer, i.&#8201;e. [Pd3(OAc)6]. Although this material is ubiquitously used to synthesize mononuclear Pd species, it may principally also lend itself to selective exchange of some of the edge&#8208;sharing acetate units in its triangular motif, whilst keeping the overall multinuclear architecture intact. Strikingly, little is known about the controlled manipulation and substoichiometric substitution chemistry of this well&#8208;defined conglomerate. We herein conclusively demonstrate that, for the first time, the targeted exchange of two or four acetate units from the Pd3(acetate)6 platform is possible, thereby installing either one or two new tridentate ligands onto this trinuclear architecture. Follow&#8208;up exchange and substitution chemistry is available without disrupting the multimetallic nature of the core structure. New complexes 2&#8211;7 are all conclusively characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Exo&#8208;Selective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the uncommon exo&#8208;selectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, exploring strategies like using bulky structures, s&#8208;cis conformations, &#945;&#8208;substitutions, transient constraints, and thermodynamic equilibriums. The aim is to understand, predict, and guide the creation of new catalysts for exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, expanding the scope of synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction stands as one of the most pivotal transformations in organic chemistry. Its efficiency, marked by the formation of two carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and up to four new stereocenters in a single step, underscores its versatility and indispensability in synthesizing natural products and pharmaceuticals. The most significant stereoselectivity feature is the &#8220;endo rule&#8221;. While this rule underpins the predictability of the stereochemical outcomes, it also underscores the challenges in achieving the opposite diastereoselectivity, making the exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions often considered outliers. This review delves into recent examples of exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, shedding light on the factors inverting the intrinsic tendency. We explore the roles of steric, electrostatic, and orbital interactions, as well as thermodynamic equilibriums in influencing exo/endo selectivity. Furthermore, we illustrate strategies to manipulate these factors, employing approaches such as bulky substituents, s&#8208;cis conformations, transient structural constraints, and innovative control physics. Through these analyses, our aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to predict and design exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, paving the way for new diastereoselective catalyst systems and expanding the chemical scope of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

         <title>A New Molybdenum Blue Structure Type: How Uranium Expands This Family of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of molybdenum polyoxometalates (POMs) has afforded large discrete nanoclusters with varied degrees of reduction such as the ~20% reduced molybdenum blues. While many heterometals have been incorporated into these clusters to afford new properties, uranium has yet to be reported. Here we report the first uranium containing molybdenum blue clusters and the unique properties exhibited by this incorporation. The uranyl ion (UO22+) directs formation of Mo72U8, a square POM comprised of two faces connected by eight edge&#8208;sharing molybdenum dimers. Mo72U8, a chiral cluster, crystallizes as a racemic mixture and, in the solid state, has a &#8216;negative&#8217; charge localized on one face of the cluster opposite the &#8216;positively&#8217; charged face of another cluster. Using U(IV) as both heterometal and molybdenum reductant afforded crystals of Mo97U10, a wheel cluster with a heptamolybdate cap on one face. Mo97U10 dissociates in solution, losing the heptamolybdate, to form Mo90U10. Using more solvent during synthesis afforded crystals of Mo90U10S4 which, instead of heptamolybdate, contains four sulfate ions. Crystals of Mo90U10S4 undergo a dehydration induced phase change where clusters form a sheet through oxide bridges. Half of the bridges are cation&#8208;cation interactions between the uranyl oxygen atom and molybdenum, the first reported of this kind.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Capturing N&#8208;Methylbenzene Sulfonamide&#8208;Phenothiazine  Incorporating Strong Electron Acceptor Push&#8208;Pull Systems: Photochemical Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the intriguing aspects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon of multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems are of paramount importance considering their promising applications, particularly in solar energy harvesting and light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores 1&#8211;6, are designed and synthesized by the Corey&#8208;Fuchs reaction via Evano&#8217;s condition followed by [2 + 2] cycloaddition retroelectrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction with strong electron acceptors TCNE and TCNQ in good yields (~60&#8211;85%). The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors TCBD and DCNQ with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor. An additional low&#8208;lying broad absorption band extended towards the NIR region suggests charge polarization after the introduction of the electron acceptors in both symmetrical and asymmetrical systems, leading to such strong ICT bands. Relative positions of the frontier orbitals on geometry&#8208;optimized structures further support accessing donor&#8208;acceptor sites responsible for the ICT transitions. Eventually, ultrafast carrier dynamics of the photoinduced species are investigated provided information about different excited states photophysical events including ICT and their associated time profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoreactor Confined and Enriched Intermediates for Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the process of electroreduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, it is imperative to enhance the concentration of key intermediate species on the catalyst surface. The utilization of micro&#8208;nano reactors to achieve confinement effects has been widely observed in various catalytic reactions, yet it has seldom been employed in eCO2RR. Here, we present a novel nanoreactor composed of stacked CuS nanosheets for eCO2RR to C2+ products. In comparison to catalyst comprising of nanosheet with open space, the C&#8208;C coupling within this confined nanospace is significantly enhanced, resulting in the increase of Faraday efficiency (FE) of C2+ products to 53%. In situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy reveals the confinement and enrichment of key intermediate by the nanoreactor. Our research findings demonstrate that a meticulously designed nanoreactor can elevate the selectivity of C2+ products, thereby aiding in the design of eCO2RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heterogenization of Eosin Y by 3D&#8208;printing and its application in photocatalysis are reported. The approach allows a fine tuning of the photocatalyst morphology and its rapid preparation. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated through model organic reactions involving oxidation, reduction, and photosensitization pathways. The efficiency, recyclability and stability of 3D printed EY is remarkable paving the way to new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts with a perfect control of their shape and adaptable to any photoreactors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light&#8208;induced charge separation and directional charge transfer are cornerstones for artificial photosynthesis and the generation of solar fuels. Here, we report synthetic access to a series of noble metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on bodipy light&#8208;absorbers and redox&#8208;active quinone / anthraquinone charge storage sites. Peripheral functionalization of the quinone / anthraquinone units with alkynes primes the dyads for integration into a range of light&#8208;harvesting systems, e.g., by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions (CLICK chemistry) or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Initial photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal the principal processes during the light&#8208;induced charge separation in the reported dyads.</dc:description>

         <title>From the Total Synthesis of Semi&#8208;Viriditoxin, Semi&#8208;Viriditoxic Acid and Dimeric Naphthopyranones to their Biological Activities in Burkitt B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8209;lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (Ghosez&#8208;cyclization and Grubbs ring&#8208;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8208;Michael&#8208;Dieckmann reaction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8209;lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction for the synthesis of Diindolylmethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes. Classic syntheses have relied on (Lewis) acid activation of aldehydes, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive in handling. In contrast, the combination of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and subsequent organocatalytic activation of the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formed aldehydes allows the use of readily available and stable alkenes with various functional groups while avoiding acidic conditions to expand the range of available diindolylmethanes. A broad scope of diindolylmethanes was prepared in yields up to 85% demonstrates the utility of the presented method.</dc:description>

Integrating functions such as energy harvesting and storage with actuators to create intelligent actuators has emerged as a growing trend in development. By functionalizing actuation materials, they can take on a range of capabilities including energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. We provide a detailed introduction to smart actuators equipped with these functions, covering design concepts, typical applications, and future prospects.







Abstract
Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail. Finally, the future research directions and applications of smart actuators are prospected from our perspective.

         <title>Proton transfer and regulation across chemical interfaces by small&#8208;molecule assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study proton transport across a membrane mimic composed of the liquid&#8208;liquid interface between an aqueous solution and an organic solution. The proton transport across this membrane mimic can be quantified and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. We show that the interfacial proton movement is controlled by the pH of the aqueous phase and cross&#8208;membrane proton transfer rate is higher at lower pHs. We utilize proton transporters found in the electron transport chain such as ubiquinols and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol to further influence the rate of proton shuttling. The ubiquinols are effective in transporting protons across the membrane when paired with a reducing agent that activates their high rate cross&#8208;membrane proton movement. 2,4&#8208;Dinitrophenol's acts as a pH activated proton transporter only active at pH&gt;4.







Abstract
We report on measurements and control of proton gradient across interfaces of water and dichloroethane. Such interfaces are interesting as mimics of biological membranes. We use impedance spectroscopy to quantify interfacial proton gradient and identify proton transfer modes. We quantify proton movement using reciprocal of time constant (&#964;&#8722;1) acquired from electrochemical impedance modeling. We show that proton gradient across interfaces of water/dichloroethane and &#964;&#8722;1 correlate with the aqueous phase pH, changing from ca. 1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;1 to 0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7. &#964;&#8722;1 changes in the presence of proton shuttling fat&#8208;soluble molecules. Dinitrophenol acts as a pH activated proton coupler which is active at around neutral pH and inert at pH &lt;4. However, quinone type cofactors change the interfacial proton transport when activated by redox reactions with ferrocene type molecules, such as decamethyl ferrocence (DMFc). Quinone type cofactors show distinct features in their impedance response assigned to a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, different from the uncoupled proton transfer activity of dinitrophenol. The observed PCET reaction significantly changes &#964;&#8722;1. We use &#964;&#8722;1 as a proton transport descriptor. In particular, CoQ10&#8208;DMFc shows a &#964;&#8722;1 of 3.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7, indicating how small&#8208;molecule assemblies change proton availability.

         <title>Probing oxygen exchange between UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF and water using 17O solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 17O labeled terephtalic acid ligand has been used for the synthesis of 17O enriched UiO&#8208;66 compound. High&#8208;field 17O solid&#8208;state NMR experiments show an overall transfer of oxygen in the structure.







Abstract
The Zr&#8208;based Metal Organic Framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66(Zr) is widely employed owing to its good thermal and chemical stabilities. Although the long&#8208;range structure of this MOF is preserved in the presence of water during several days, little is known about the formation of defects, which cannot be detected using diffraction techniques. We apply here 17O solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy at 18.8&#8197;T to investigate the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66, through the exchange of oxygen atoms between the different sites of the MOF and water. For that purpose, we have selectively enriched in 17O isotope the carboxylate groups of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by using it with 17O&#8208;labeled terephthalic acid prepared using mechanochemistry. In the presence of water at 50&#8201;&#176;C and a following dehydration at 150&#8201;&#176;C, we observe an overall exchange of O atoms between COO&#8722; and &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the three distinct oxygen sites, &#956;3&#8208;OH, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; and COO&#8722;, of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF can be enriched in 17O isotope by post&#8208;synthetic hydrothermal treatment in the presence of 17O&#8208;enriched water. These results demonstrate the lability of Zr&#8722;O bonds and the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) with water.

         <title>Ca(II) and Yb(II) complexes featuring M(C&#8801;C)4 structural motif: enforced proximity or genuine &#951;2&#8208;bonding?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the alkyne triple C&#8801;C bond to Ca2+ and Yb2+ ions in the 1,8&#8208;bis(ethynyl)substituted carbazolide complexes is confirmed in the solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and in the solution by NMR spectroscopy. QTIAM analysis proves the existence of M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C) T&#8208;shaped bond pathways.







Abstract
Bis(carbazolide) complexes M[3,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;1,8&#8208;(RC&#8801;C)2Carb]2(THF)n (R=SiMe3, n=0, M=Ca, Yb; R=Ph, n=1, M=Ca, Yb; n=0, M=Yb) were synthesized through transamination reaction of M[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 with two molar equivalents of carbazoles. The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution.

The complexes feature M(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline- and rare-earth metals &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR-spectroscopy in the solution.

Herein, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated alkanes using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any utilization of external base, oxidant, and pre&#8208;functionalization is described. Using the presented methodology, the high&#8208;value&#8208;added compound parvaquone (a commercially available drug for treating theileriosis) and its derivatives can be directly constructed under ambient reaction conditions.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of unreactive hydrocarbons is always challenging due to its inherited chemical inertness, slightly different reactivity of various C&#8722;H bonds, and intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Here, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated hydrocarbons using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any external acid or base and pre&#8208;functionalization is presented. The selective C&#8722;H functionalization of tertiary over secondary and secondary over primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in abundant chemical feedstocks was achieved, and hydroxylation of quinones was realized in&#8197;situ by employing the developed methodology. This protocol provides a new catalytic system for the direct construction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added compounds, namely, parvaquone (a commercially available drug used to treat theileriosis) and its derivatives under ambient reaction conditions. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol applies to various linear&#8208;, branched&#8208;, and cyclo&#8208;alkanes with high degrees of site selectivity under blue&#8208;light irradiated conditions and could provide rapid and straightforward access to versatile methodologies for upgrading feedstock chemicals. Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition was fabricated. The host dimer M1 which exhibits blue fluorescence was prepared by decorating benzo[15]crown&#8208;5 with a quinoline group. M1 can crosslink the ammonium cations&#8208;grafted polymer P1 to form a supramolecular polymer networks through host&#8208;guest recognition, accompanied by the transformation of blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence.







Abstract
We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.

         <title>Characterization of the Ligand Properties of Donor&#8208;stabilized Pnictogenyltrielanes</title>

The syntheses and characterizations of alkyl&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (E=P, As; R=alkyl) are presented. Together with other donor&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes, these compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 and their ligand properties evaluated regarding the steric and electronic nature of this class of compounds. According to the corresponding Tolman Electronic Parameters, the compounds are significantly more electron&#8208;rich than regular phosphines and their steric and electronic demands can be modified easily.







Abstract
A general synthesis and the characterization of novel alkyl&#8208;substituted NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, E=P, As; R2=Me2, Ph2, tBuH, Cy2, (SiMe3)2) are reported. These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2)Ni(CO)3] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH2} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One allogon hardly ever comes alone but the bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) presented here is a unique case where the selective crystallization of two individual allogons &#8211; one with a square planar and one with a distorted FeO2 core &#8211; has been reached. Theoretical investigations allowed for the rationalization of this phenomenon. Reaction with O2 proceeds within milliseconds as monitored by stopped&#8208;flow measurements.







Abstract
Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200&#8197;ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2&#8901;THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One allogon hardly ever comes alone&lt;/b&gt; but the bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) presented here is a unique case where the selective crystallization of two individual allogons &#8211; one with a square planar and one with a distorted FeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core &#8211; has been reached. Theoretical investigations allowed for the rationalization of this phenomenon. Reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds within milliseconds as monitored by stopped-flow measurements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deprotonation of O(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with LiO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu followed by reaction with FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in THF led to the complex [&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe][Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;-Fe sites of Fe/ZSM-5. Reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200&#8197;ms; an intermediate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adduct could not be identified by stopped-flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; entity. Hence, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stacked Covalent Organic Ribbons Perpendicular to Graphene Oxide Sheets; a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D Design for Photocatalytic Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of 1D covalent organic frameworks perpendicularly on the surface of GO nanosheets, a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D design, improves the photocatalytic performance for many tandem oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. Under white light irradiation, 1D COF nanorods exhibit a superior visible light activity. The improved charge transfer and desirable separation rate obtain through the junction between COR and GO sheets.







Abstract
Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicular to the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) with coefficient of 4.400&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92&#8201;%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02&#8197;min&#8722;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.

         <title>Synthesis and dark state EPR properties of PDI&#8208;trityl dyads and triads</title>

Chromophore&#8208;radical systems are promising structures for quantum information science experiments, due to the possibility of generating high&#8208;spin states with strong spin polarization upon light excitation. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a number of different perylene diimides covalently linked to trityl radicals and explore their dark state properties by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8208;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.&#8201;g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8208;chromophore&#8208;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.

Reactions of the NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf with NaPH2 were carried out. Hereby, mixtures of isomers of the unprecedented parent hydride adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 were isolated in different ratios in favour of the latter isomer, depending on the reaction conditions. Subsequent reactions of these isomers yielded the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 as well as the cyclohexyl&#8208;like anion [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8211;.







Abstract
The syntheses of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of group 13, 14 and 15 element hydrides are reported. Salt metathesis reactions between NaPH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) led to mixtures of the two isomers IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 (2&#8201;b); by altering the reaction conditions an almost exclusive formation of 2&#8201;b was achieved. Attempts to purify mixtures of 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b by re&#8208;crystallization from THF afforded a salt [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;IDipp][PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2] (4) that contains the novel anionic cyclohexyl&#8208;like inorganic heterocycle [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8722;. In addition, the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;b) as even longer chain compounds were obtained from reactions of 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b with H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the mechanism and energetics associated with 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b isomerization as well as their decomposition pathways.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Cd&#8208;based hybrid multifunctional compounds with dual&#8208;stable behavior in dielectric, high transition temperature and bright fluorescence were reported. Then, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), and halide framework (Cl to I) on fluorescent properties.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we designed a novel PDI&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOF as a photocatalytic molecular reactor for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of sulfur ethers to sulfoxides. High yields and excellent selectivity and recyclability were demonstrated, which provide a basis for further investigation of the mechanism of action of PDI&#8208;MOF in other photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalytic molecular reactors for varied reactions have drawn great attention. In this work, we designed a novel photoactive perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(3&#8217;,3&#8221;,5&#8217;,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl))&#8208;1,2,6,7&#8208;tetrachloroperylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid diimide (Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA) and use it to successfully synthesize a novel Zr(IV)&#8208;based MOF 1 constructed from [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters bridged by Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA ligands. Structural analysis revealed that Zr&#8208;MOF 1 manifests a 3D framework with (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topology and possesses triangular channels of ~17&#8197;&#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26&#8197;&#197; along c&#8208;axis. Moreover, the synthesized Zr&#8208;MOF 1 exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor. When Zr&#8208;MOF 1 was used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light, it could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield and selectivity. Experimental results demonstrated that the substrate sulfides could be fixed in the pores of 1 and directly transformed to the products sulfoxides in the solid state. Furthermore, the mechanism for the photocatalytic transformation was also investigated and the results revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generated by the energy transfer and electron transfer from the photoexcited Zr&#8208;MOF to oxidants were the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.

Heavy group 14&#8208;15&#8201;compounds: Various low&#8208;valent group 14&#8211;15 compounds of the type [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (M=Ge&#8722;Pb, E=As&#8722;Bi) were obtained by salt elimination reactions. The focus of these investigations is on the heavy representatives of both groups, on the structures and the reactivity.







Abstract
A series of low&#8208;valent Group 14&#8211;15 compounds were obtained starting from [(Dipp2NacNac)MCl] (M=Ge&#8208;Pb) (I&#8211;III) (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2) and M'E(SiMe3)2 (M&#8217;=Li, E=As; M&#8217;=K, E=Sb, Bi) (IV&#8211;VI). In the course of this investigations we were able to fully characterize all permutations except Pb&#8722;Bi for compounds of the composition [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (1E: M=Ge, 2E: M=Sn, 3E: M=Pb). Thus, we report the first low valent tetrelene with Sn&#8722;Bi bond. All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and except compound 1As by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Moreover, were examined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and investigated the reactivity of these compounds towards different substrates in more detail. Starting with the compound [(Dipp2NacNac)SnAs(SiMe3)2] (2As), the reaction with red selenium yields [(Dipp2NacNac)Sn&#8722;Se&#8208;As(SiMe3)2] (4) which exhibits a Sn&#8722;Se&#8722;As chain.

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C. jejuni HS:4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides have the potential to be used as potent immunogens in vaccinations. The regio&#8208; and stereoselective opening of pyranosyl epoxides has been taken advantage of to obtain a family of very challenging thiooligosaccharide antigens related to Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens very challenging. So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeeded the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations.

&lt;p&gt;Enzyme-resistant thioglycosides have the potential to be used as potent immunogens in vaccinations. The regio- and stereoselective opening of pyranosyl epoxides has been taken advantage of to obtain a family of very challenging thiooligosaccharide antigens related to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; HS:4 with unprecedented efficiency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enzyme-resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#8594;4)-linked 6-deoxy-&#946;-D-&lt;i&gt;ido&lt;/i&gt;-heptopyranoside and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-glucosamine; the rare 6-deoxy-&lt;i&gt;ido&lt;/i&gt;-heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;-anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens very challenging. So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;-glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3-epoxide functionality of pre-designed 6-deoxy-&#946;-D-&lt;i&gt;talo&lt;/i&gt;-heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans-thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and regio and stereo-selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeeded the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base-stable but acid-labile 2-trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl-1-thioacetates in a one-pot manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diindolocarbazole&#8208;Based Rigid Donor&#8208;Acceptor TADF Molecules for Energy and Electron Transfer Photocatalysis
</title>

Four twisted D&#8208;A TADF molecules based on diindolocarbazole and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor were synthesized, characterized and utilized for photocatalytic E&#8722;Z isomerization of stilbene and C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26&#8197;eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4&#8197;ns to 31&#8197;ns) and longer delayed components (36.4&#8197;ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80&#8201;%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~90&#8201;%.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloids are known to be modified by natural polyphenols via amination. This study investigates the oxidative coupling mechanisms between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles, using in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. It is shown that polyphenols with a pyrogallol substructure and an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the C4a&#8208;position are most effective. These insights can play a crucial role in drug design against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8722;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8722;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in&#8197;vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Pyrene&#8208;decorated Planar Chiral [2,2]Paracyclophanes with Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence between Monomer and Excimer</title>

Various pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives can be constructed by different substitution modes and connection patterns of [2,2]PCP cores and pyrene units. Diverse structures of these compounds lead to distinctive optical properties.







Abstract
We reported the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse CPL&#8208;active molecules, in which pyrene units were installed to chiral pm/po&#8208;[2,2]PCP scaffolds either with or without a triple bond spacer for pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral Rp&#8208;[2,2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colours and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylene diimide through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to near&#8208;white fluorescence.

&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;po&lt;/i&gt;-PCP-P2&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. The X-ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene-based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene-based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;pm&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;po&lt;/i&gt;-PCP-P1&lt;/b&gt; emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;pm&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt;po&lt;/i&gt;-PCP-P2&lt;/b&gt; emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;p-&lt;i&gt;pm&lt;/i&gt;-PCP-P1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;p-&lt;i&gt;pm&lt;/i&gt;-PCP-P2&lt;/b&gt; exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;p-[2,2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene-based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene-based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colours and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylene diimide through &#960;-&#960; interactions, leading to near-white fluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence (EDIEA) is an efficient approach to bicyclic fused and bridged mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks. The method is applicable for the multigram preparation of the target compounds, which is illustrated by synthesis of over 50 building blocks on up to 150&#8197;g scale. Physicochemical and structural parameters of the title scaffolds illustrate their utility as promising benzene and cycloalkane isosteres and provide a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compound's properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.&#8201;e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.

         <title>An Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Indazolylindazolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign supporting electrolyte&#8208;free oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazole has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical indazolylindazolones via electrochemical reduction of aerial oxygen. Simultaneously, unsymmetrical coupling products were efficiently produced by cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between indazolone and 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives through electrochemical C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We have established a supporting&#8208;electrolyte free electrochemical method for the synthesis of indazolylindazolones through oxygen reduction reaction (eORR) induced 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazoles where 2H&#8208;indazole is used as both aminating agent as well as the precursor of indazolone. Moreover, we have merged indazolone and indazole to get unsymmetrical indazolylindazolones through direct electrochemical cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC). This exogenous metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free protocol delivered a number of multi&#8208;functionalized products with high tolerance of diverse functional groups.

A metal&#8208;free protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective thioarylation at the C3 position of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo) is presented.

Experimental studies and NMR analyses were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free coupling protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective C3&#8208;thioarylation of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo). The developed procedure enables the coupling of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and hindered arylthiols, providing a series of C3&#8208;modified iminoKdo derivatives in moderate to good yields. Elucidation of active species through controlled experimental studies and time&#8208;lapse 31P NMR analysis provides insights into the reaction mechanism. We demonstrate that, following a tandem Staudinger/aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of an azido&#8208;containing keto ester, an inseparable equimolar mixture of imine/enamine is formed. The enamine then undergoes a Stork&#8208;like nucleophilic attack with the in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed disulfide reagent, resulting in the formation of the coupling products. Additionally, we describe a rarely reported acid&#8208;promoted aromatization of the C3&#8208;thioarylated iminoKdo skeleton into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates, which are reminiscent of dichotomines.

         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported the one&#8208;pot synthesis, structures, and properties of novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, in comparison with benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. The different structures and properties can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. A new BODIPY with helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton and intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption was developed.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1&#8201;b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we reported the one-pot synthesis, structures, and properties of novel fulvene-[b]-fused BODIPYs, in comparison with benzene-[b]-fused BODIPYs. The different structures and properties can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we developed a one-pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene-[b]-fused BODIPYs from &#945;-(2-alkynylphenyl)-pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5-exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene-[b]-fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>

Unfolding novel metal carbenes: Silver(III) carbene complexes with square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometries are reported. These unprecedented organosilver(III) compounds exhibit remarkable stability: In the solid state they evolve into mixed&#8208;valence Ag(I)/Ag(III) compounds only at high temperatures (&gt;185&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.

         <title>Tridentate NacNac Tames T&#8208;Shaped Nickel(I) Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally stable, T&#8208;shaped, nickel(I) radical was straightforward obtained by reduction of a tridentate nacnac nickel(II) chloride with KSi(TMS)3. The metalloradical character of the compound was demonstrated by the formation of a highly unusual nickeloxaziridine complex upon addition of TEMPO. The Ni(I) species displays a rich chemistry towards activation S&#8722;S, and Se&#8722;Se bond leading to unusual C&#8722;C coupled product as well as dihydrogen activation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to generate monomeric nickel hydride.







Abstract
The reaction of a nickel(II) chloride complex containing a tridentate &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand with a picolyl group [2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3NC(Me)CHC(Me)NH(CH2py)]Ni(II)Cl (1)] with KSi(SiMe3)3 conveniently afforded a nickel(I) radical with a T&#8208;shaped geometry (2). The compound&#8216;s metalloradical nature was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies and its reaction with TEMPO, resulting in the formation of a highly unusual three&#8208;membered nickeloxaziridine complex (3). When reacted with disulfide and diselenide, the S&#8722;S and Se&#8722;Se bonds were cleaved, and a coupled product was formed through carbon atom of the pyridine&#8208;imine group. The nickel(I) radical activates dihydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to give the monomeric nickel hydride.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Sulfones Using Bis&#8208;Piperidine Sulfur Dioxide &#8211; An Underutilized Reagent for SO2 Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot sulfone preparation is reported from alkyl bromides activated by silane&#8208;mediated halogen atom transfer. In the process, a previously unutilized SO2 adduct bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide &#8211; or PIPSO &#8211; was found to be the best source of SO2 for radical capture under the reaction conditions. Alkyl and aryl sulfones were prepared as well as sulfonylated APIs.







Abstract
Sulfonyl groups are widely observed in biologically relevant molecules and consequently, SO2 capture is an increasingly attractive method to prepare these sulfonyl&#8208;containing compounds given the range of SO2&#8208;surrogates now available as alternatives to using the neat gas. This, along with the advent of photoredox catalysis, has enabled mild radical capture of SO2 to emerge as an effective route to sulfonyl compounds. Here we report a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile sulfonylation of aryl and alkyl bromides making use of a previously under&#8208;used amine&#8208;SO2 surrogate; bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide (PIPSO). A broad selection of alkyl and aryl bromides were photocatalytically converted to their corresponding sulfinates and then trapped with various electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot multistep procedure to prepare sulfones and sulfonamides.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins as Supramolecular Reactors for the Three&#8208;component Aza&#8208;Darzens Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work aims to study the aza&#8208;Darzens reaction using water as a solvent in a nanoconfined environment. This study was carried out on four different gamma&#8208;cyclodextrin systems to evaluate the reaction yield and the cis/trans ratio of the aziridines obtained. In addition, the reaction mechanism was studied using molecular dynamics and the support of mass spectrometry and DOSY experiments.







Abstract
In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three&#8208;component aza&#8208;Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N&#8208;phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric &#947;&#8208;CD such as a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge&#8208;like macroporous &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based cryogel (GCDC), and a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco&#8208;friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.

Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives have attracted significant recent interest in drug discovery as alkyne, tert&#8208;butyl and arene bioisosteres, where their incorporation is frequently associated with increased compound solubility and metabolic stability. While strategies for functionalisation of the bridgehead (1,3) positions are extensively developed, platforms allowing divergent substitution at the bridge (2,4,5) positions remain limited. Recent reports have introduced 1&#8208;electron strategies for arylation and incorporation of a small range of other substituents, but are limited in terms of scope, yields or practical complexity. Herein, we show the synthesis of diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalised BCPs through lithium&#8208;halogen exchange of a readily accessible BCP bromide. When coupled with medicinally relevant product derivatisations, our developed 2&#8208;electron &#8220;late stage&#8221; approach provides rapid and straightforward access to unprecedented BCP structural diversity (&gt;20&#8197;hitherto&#8208;unknown motifs reported). Additionally, we describe a method for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;BCP&#8221; bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes through a novel stereoselective bridgehead desymmetrisation.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stopper exchange reactions between a rotaxane building block and diamine reagents gave dramatically different outcome in solution and in solvent&#8208;free conditions. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution but the inclusion complex is preserved under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Diamine reagents have been used to functionalize a [2]rotaxane building block bearing an activated pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution and acylation of the released axle generates a [2]rotaxane with an elongated axle subunit. In contrast, the corresponding [3]rotaxane can be obtained if the reaction conditions are appropriate to stabilize the inclusion complex of the mono&#8208;amine intermediate and the pillar[5]arene. This is the case when the stopper exchange is performed under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8211;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of both magnetic relaxation and spin coherence on single&#8208;ion Cu(II) centers in the three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having phase memory time above microsecond. It provides a new platform for the application of MOFs as spin quantum materials having fine&#8208;tuning ability.







Abstract
With the aim of creating Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5&#8201;%, 2&#8201;%, 1&#8201;%, and 0.1&#8201;% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][ZnII(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g&#8208;factors (gx=2.07, gy=2.12, and gz=2.44) in the S=1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&#964;) of 3.5&#8197;ms (5&#8201;% Cu), 9.2&#8197;ms (2&#8201;% Cu), and 15&#8197;ms (1&#8201;% Cu) at 1.8&#8197;K. Furthermore, pulse&#8208;ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin&#8208;spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21&#8197;&#956;s (2&#8201;%Cu), 0.39&#8197;&#956;s (1&#8201;%Cu), and 3.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.1&#8201;%Cu) at 10&#8197;K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS=&#177;1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)&#8208;doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50&#8197;K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the magnetic dipole interactions relating with cross&#8208;relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.

Let there be rock! Like the hand of a guitarist moving all over the guitar neck when improvising a solo, the pillar[5]arene moiety of a rotaxane slides over the axle component with preferential positions and a substantial distortion. A complete understanding of such motions was achieved by detailed variable&#8208;temperature NMR investigations with the help of density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Nierengarten, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304131).

An efficient, atom&#8208;economic synthesis for a family of thio&#8208;oligosaccharides related to C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharide is facilitated by epoxide&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;thioglycosylation. Access to these thio&#8208;linked analogs, known to have enhanced metabolic stability, has the potential to boost immunogenicity, accelerating the development of a synthetic vaccine against C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4, a multi&#8208;drug&#8208;resistant pathogen ranked as a high priority by the WHO.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multipurpose silver(III) fluoride. Access to the first silver(III) carbene complexes has been achieved by reaction of the fluoride [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] precursor with different imidazolium salts. The novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. This synthetic procedure is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Baya and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303937).

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, the fluorination of polymer donors has dominated the development of high&#8208;performance OSCs. This review summarized the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, fluorinated polymers and their physical and photovoltaic properties. A concise outlook is presented for fluorinated polymer donors to fulfill the practical application of OSCs.







Abstract
The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) over 19&#8201;%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we primarily summarized the hybridizations between four classical fluorophores, namely xanthene, cyanine, coumarin and BODIPY. We provided an overview of the connection modes between conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated hybrid fluorophores. Hybrid fluorophores have played an irreplaceable role in the fields of biological detection, diagnosis and treatment.







Abstract
Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) is a promising electrode material, which has the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area, excellent thermal stability. The effective strategies (introducing active sites, constructing conjugated structures, carbon composites, etc.) for improving the conductivity and stability of COFs materials are summarized, and the current challenges and future design directions of COFs electrodes are discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high&#8208;performance alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The dramatically different outcome of the stopper exchange reactions performed in solution and under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions is certainly the most important finding reported in this paper.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202304131).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the group of Iwona and Jean&#8208;Fran&#231;ois Nierengarten from the University of Strasbourg (LIMA, UMR 7042, CNRS) and collaborators from the University of Carthage and the IPHC (University of Strasbourg and CNRS, UMR 7178). The image illustrates the fast motions of a pillar[5]arene subunit along the axle of a rotaxane, reminiscent of those of a guitarist's hand along the neck allowing him to use random parts of a scale with certain sweet spots when improvising a solo.

         <title>The Role of Base in Reaction Performance of Photochemical Synthesis of Thiazoles: An Integrated Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) is emerging as pivotal in synthetic chemistry, offering revolutionary potential in retrosynthetic analysis, reaction conditions and reaction prediction. We have combined chemical descriptors, primarily based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, with various AI/ML tools such as Multi&#8208;Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole in photoredox reactions. Significantly, our models underscore the critical role of the molecular structure and physicochemical characteristics of the base, especially the total atomic polarizabilities, in the rate&#8208;determining steps involving cyclohexyl and phenethyl moieties of the substrate. Moreover, we validated our findings in articles through experimental studies. It showcases the power of AI/ML and quantum chemistry in shaping the future of organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Solvatochirochromism of Single Benzene Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvents influence the structure, aggregation and folding behaviors of solvatochromic compounds. Ultrasensitive solvent mediated chiroptical response is conducive to the fabrication of molecular platform for sensing and recognition, which however, remains great challenges in conceptual or applicable design. Here we report a cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents. Compared to the ratiometrically responsive systems, the chiroptical activities could be triggered or inverted depending on the substituents of chiral entities with an ultralow solvent volume fraction (&lt;1 vol%). On drop of dipolar solvents shall significantly induce the emergence or inversion of chiroptical signals in bulky phases. Based on the experimental and computational studies, the ultrasensitivity is contributed to the intimate interplay between solvents and chiral compounds that anchors the specific chiral conformation. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Monolayer Catalysts: Towards Efficient Water Splitting and Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
A viable alternative to non&#8208;renewable hydrocarbon fuels is hydrogen gas, created using a safe, environmentally friendly process like water splitting. An important role in water&#8208;splitting applications is played by the development of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), transition metal carbides (MXenes), graphene&#8208;derived 2D layered nanomaterials, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. Advanced synthesis methods and characterization instruments enabled an effective application for improved electrocatalytic water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production. Enhancing active sites, modifying the phase and electronic structure, adding conductive elements like transition metals, forming heterostructures, altering the defect state, etc., can improve the catalytic activity of 2D stacked hybrid monolayer nanomaterials. The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.

         <title>Each Interruption is an Opportunity: Novel Synthetic Strategies Explored Through Interrupted Click Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction between azides and alkynes, known as CuAAC, has allowed for the efficient synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted 1,4&#8208;triazoles and the formation of a metallocycle intermediate. This intermediate can be used for creating new structures or generating multi&#8208;component reactions, collectively referred to as &#8220;interrupted click reactions&#8221;







Abstract
The particular and unique mechanism of the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction between azides and alkynes (CuAAC) has not only allowed for the efficient synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted 1,4&#8208;triazoles in excellent yields and under mild conditions, becoming the quintessential click reaction, but it has also enabled the straightforward formation of a metallocycle intermediate, the copper triazolyl. This, under suitable reaction conditions able to suppress its protonolysis, can be used either for the creation of new bicyclic triazolyl structures or for the generation of novel three or four&#8208;component reactions. The aim of this review is to rationalize and unify all these transformations, which are collectively referred to as &#8220;interrupted click reactions&#8221;.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Silylated Diazoalkynes: New Tools for Bioconjugation of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi&#8208;functionnal reagents bearing a Si&#8208;stabilized diazo function and a terminal alkyne can react with peptides or protein selectively at carboxylic residues in buffered aqueous media. A dramatic kinetic improvement of the conjugation is observed by in&#8208;situ fluoride&#8208;induced desilylation. Post&#8208;functionalization using click chemistry enables a late stage flexible diversification of the alkyne moiety.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Silylated diazoalkynes are stabilized diazo compounds that can selectively react with carboxylic residues in buffered aqueous media. In&#8208;situ fluoride induced desilylation increases this reactivity, leading to a very fast reaction. Application to the selective functionalization of RNase A, followed by post&#8208;functionalization using click chemistry, is described. These new reagents expand the toolbox for native protein modification at carboxylic residues.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Twostep Chemobiocatalytic Synthesis of a Furan Amino Acid from 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemobiocatalytic tandem process toward 5&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC) was developed by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and a whole&#8208;cell catalyst in a single reaction vessel, starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and inexpensive ammonium formate. The desired product was obtained with 81&#8201;% yield. More importantly, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41&#8197;g/L&#8201;h productivity.







Abstract
Recently, catalytic valorization of biomass&#8208;derived furans has received growing interest. 5&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC), a furan amino acid, holds great promise in the aeras of polymer and pharmaceutical, but its synthesis remains limited. In this work, we report a chemobiocatalytic route toward AMFC by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and recombinant Escherichia coli (named E.&#8197;coli_TAF) harboring &#969;&#8208;transaminase (TA), L&#8208;alanine dehydrogenase (L&#8208;AlaDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In the cascade, HMF is oxidized into 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) by laccase&#8208;TEMPO system, and then the resulting intermediate is converted into AMFC by E.&#8197;coli_TAF via transamination with cheap ammonium formate instead of costly organic amine donors, theoretically generating H2O and CO2 as by&#8208;products. The tandem process was run in a one&#8208;pot twostep manner, affording AMFC with approximately 81&#8201;% yield, together with 10&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as by&#8208;product. In addition, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41&#8197;g/L&#8201;h productivity and 8.6&#8197;g/L titer. This work may pave the way for green manufacturing of the furan&#8208;containing amino acid.

In the cascade, HMF is oxidized into 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) by laccase-TEMPO system, and then the resulting intermediate is converted into AMFC by &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt;_TAF via transamination with cheap ammonium formate instead of costly organic amine donors, theoretically generating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as by-products. The tandem process was run in a one-pot twostep manner, affording AMFC with approximately 81&#8201;% yield, together with 10&#8201;% 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as by-product. In addition, the scale-up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41&#8197;g/L&#8201;h productivity and 8.6&#8197;g/L titer. This work may pave the way for green manufacturing of the furan-containing amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Design of 3D Current Collectors for Lithium Metal Anodes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collector can solve the nature problem of hostless for Li, suppress the growth of Li dendrites and alleviate the volume expansion during repeated cycles. This review summarizes the recent development that facilitates the use of current collectors for Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Due to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low redox potential (&#8722;3.04&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) received increasing attentions. However, notorious dendrite and volume expansion during the cycling process seriously hinder the development of high energy density Li metal batteries. Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collectors for Li can fundamentally solve the intrinsic drawback of hostless for Li. Therefore, this review systematically introduces the design and synthesis engineering and the current development status of different 3D collectors in recent years (the current collectors are divided into two major parts: metal&#8208;based current collectors and carbon&#8208;based current collectors). In the end, some perspectives of the future promotion for LMA application are also presented.

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Hydridostannylene: A Masked Sn(I) Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity (including catalytic activity) of hydridostannylene (1&#8208;H2) with a variety of unsaturated (alkyne, carbonyl, azo) substrates has been reported. 1&#8208;H2 (e.&#8201;g.) undergoes dehydrogenative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with Ph2CO to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene 1&#8208;OCPh2, which readily liberates Ph2CO on exposure to H2 and regenerates 1&#8208;H2. Thus, 1&#8208;H2 behaves as a masked Sn&#8208;diradicaloid 1 that also affords 1&#8208;OCPh2 on treatment with Ph2CO.







Abstract
Herein, reactivity studies of a cyclic bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADC)SnH]2 (1&#8208;H2) (ADC=PhC{(NDipp)C}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with various unsaturated organic substrates are reported. Reactions of terminal alkynes (RC&#8801;CH) with 1&#8208;H2 afford mixed acetylide&#8208;vinyl&#8208;functionalized bis&#8208;stannylenes via dehydrogenation and hydrostannylation. Treatment of 1&#8208;H2 with PhC&#8801;CCH3 gives a unique distannabarrelene via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H stannylation and hydrostannylation of the C&#8801;CCH3 moiety. 1&#8208;H2 undergoes dehydrogenative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions with diphenylacetylene, azobenzene, acetone, benzophenone, and benzaldehyde to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene derivatives. The elimination of H2 in these reactions suggests the masked&#8208;diradical property of 1&#8208;H2. In fact, these [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition products are also accessible on treatments of the Sn(I) diradicaloid [(ADC)Sn]2 (1) with appropriate reagents. All compounds have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, the catalytic activity of 1&#8208;H2 has been shown for the hydroboration of unsaturated substrates.

         <title>Continuous isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran over Ga&#8208;silicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFI framework zeolites and zeotypes enable the isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran through a heterogeneously catalysed route. Incorporating gallium instead of aluminium increases the selectivity and durability of the catalyst. This reaction is promoted by suitable acidity of the catalyst and steric confinement in the micropores.







Abstract
2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five&#8208;membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed&#8208;bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga&#8208;silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation. This work provides new opportunities for the continuous valorisation of bio&#8208;feedstock molecules in the perspective of the emerging biorefinery era.

         <title>Construction of Bidentate Phosphines Enabled by Photoinduced Reductive Diphosphination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination of alkenes was realized for the synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines. The Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals, which served as an ideal phosphine source for alkene diphosphination under reducing conditions.







Abstract
The diphosphination of alkenes through a radical pathway offers a promising approach for the rapid construction of aryl bisphosphines. However, such a synthetic strategy has not been successfully applied to the preparation of alkyl bisphosphines, partially due to the difficulties in the generation of phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals from common alkyl phosphine compounds. We herein demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by hiring Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine as the phosphine source that can act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals. With this novel strategy, a photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination reaction has been established, allowing for a straightforward synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines.

The masked transition&#8208;metal frustrated Lewis pairs [Cp*M(&#954;3N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;L)][SbF6] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; M=Ir, 1, Rh, 2; HL=pyridinyl&#8208;amidine ligand) reversibly activate H2 under mild conditions rendering the hydrido derivatives [Cp*MH(&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;HL)][SbF6] observed as a mixture of the E and Z isomers at the amidine C=N bond (M=Ir, 3Z, 3E; M=Rh, 4Z, 4E). DFT calculations indicate that the formation of the E isomers follows a Grotthuss type mechanism in the presence of water. A mixture of Rh(I) isomers of formula [(Cp*H)Rh(&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;HL)][SbF6] (5&#8201;a&#8211;d) is obtained by reductive elimination of Cp*H from 4. The formation of 5&#8201;a&#8211;d was elucidated by means of DFT calculations. Finally, when 2 reacts with D2, the Cp* and Cp*H ligands of the resulting rhodium complexes 4 and 5, respectively, are deuterated as a result of a reversible hydrogen abstraction from the Cp* ligand and D2 activation at rhodium.

         <title>Glutathione Protects other Cellular Thiols against Oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) exhibits potent anticancer activity at submicromolar concentration in cell culture. A proposed mode of action is the production of hydroxyl radicals (HO&#8901;) upon copper coordination (CuII&#8208;Dp44mT) and thiol oxidation. The evaluation of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT reactivity with several biologically relevant thiols suggested that glutathione (GSH) could protect cysteine (Cys), free or in proteins, against oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;thiosemicarbazones have been intensively investigated for their application in cancer therapy or as antimicrobials. Copper(II)&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;thiosemicarbazone (CuII&#8208;Dp44mT) showed anticancer activity in the submicromolar concentration range in cell culture. The interaction of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT with thiols leading to their depletion or inhibition was proposed to be involved in this activity. Indeed, CuII&#8208;Dp44mT can catalyze the oxidation of thiols although with slow kinetics. The present work aims to obtain insights into the catalytic activity and selectivity of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT toward the oxidation of different biologically relevant thiols. Reduced glutathione (GSH), L&#8208;cysteine (Cys), N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC), D&#8208;penicillamine (D&#8208;Pen), and the two model proteins glutaredoxin (Grx) and thioredoxin (Trx) were investigated. CuII&#8208;Dp44mT catalyzed the oxidation of these thiols with different kinetics, with rates in the following order D&#8208;Pen&gt;Cys&#8811;NAC&gt;GSH and Trx&gt;Grx. CuII&#8208;Dp44mT was more efficient than CuII chloride for the oxidation of NAC and GSH, but not D&#8208;Pen and Cys. In mixtures of biologically relevant concentrations of GSH and either Cys, Trx, or Grx, the oxidation kinetics and spectral properties were similar to that of GSH alone, indicating that the interaction of these thiols with CuII&#8208;Dp44mT is dominated by GSH. Hence GSH could protect other thiols against potential deleterious oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT.

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited for aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and 3D&#8208;printing applications. However, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dyes onto common polymers is not a practical preparation technique. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400092), Y. Koyama and co&#8208;workers describe the design, synthesis, click reaction, and optical properties of dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO). The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>In2Q2: A New Entry of 16&#8208;Membered Tetraazamacrocycle Concatenating Indole and Quinoline Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The synthetic protocol utilizing macrocyclic diamide as a pivotal precursor allowed us to access a series of In2Q2 derivatives bearing various substituents on the periphery. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting physicochemical properties were revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids are an extraordinary group of compounds, fully ionic in structure like inorganic salts but with low melting points, that resemble organic molecular solvents. Their chemical, electrochemical, and thermal stability is what draws the attention and enables their use in many applications, including electrochemical power sources. Even though they are no longer considered eco&#8208;friendly because of nonnegligible toxicity and long bioaccumulation, they can still be efficiently recovered, purified, and reused. These attributes can be harvested to enhance the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The variety of ions and cations for ILs and their influence on the final properties of the compound opens the road to tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes. Ionic liquids as plasticizers constitute a major part of gel polymer electrolytes (average of 70 wt%) and hence, they affect the fundamental properties of gel electrolytes like ionic conductivity and electrochemical window. They also improve the safety features of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is relevant for their anticipated applications in stationary energy storage and electric vehicles. The presented review paper aims to explain the relationship between the cation and anion in ionic liquid and the properties of gel electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Vanadium doping and external modification design of P2&#8208;type layered Mn&#8208;based oxides as competitive cathodes toward Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P2&#8208;type layered manganese&#8208;based oxides have attracted considerable interest as economical, cathode materials with high energy density for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their potential, these materials still face challenges related to sluggish kinetics and structural instability. In this study, a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F was developed by surface&#8208;coating P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2 with a thin layer of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F to enhance both the electrochemical sodium storage and material air stability. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176 mA h g&#8208;1 within the 1.5&#8208;4.1 V range at a low current density of 17 mA g&#8208;1. At an increased current density of 850 mA g&#8208;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112 mAh g&#8208;1. These findings validate the significant enhancement of ion diffusion capabilities and rate performance in the P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material conferred by the composite cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Flip via Subtle Electronic Perturbation in Axially Ligated Diiron(III) Porphyrin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin state switching in the metal center is a crucial phenomenon in many enzymatic reactions in biology. In the current work, the spin state transition of iron(III) from high to intermediate via an admixed state is observed upon a subtle electronic perturbations to the sulphonate moieties coordinated axially to a diiron(III)porphyrin dimer. While electron&#8208;donating substituents stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of iron, strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing groups stabilize an intermediate&#8208;spin state, whereas the moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of axial ligands resulted in an admixed state. Electronic structures have been confirmed utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, M&#246;ssbauer, magnetic, EPR, and 1H NMR spectroscopic investigations. The 1H NMR spectra are found to be characteristic of the spin state of the iron. The signals of the high and intermediate&#8208;spin complexes follow the Curie and anti&#8208;Curie temperature dependence, respectively, whereas the admixed&#8208;spin state of iron displays significant curvature of the lines in the Curie plot. An extensive DFT analysis displays a linear correlation between the Fe&#8208;O distance and the spin density over the oxygen atom, as well as the Fe&#8208;Npor distance for the complexes. Thus, a slight electronic perturbation at a far end of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of new metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) thin films is important for expanding their functions and applications. Herein, we first report a new kind of MOF thin film by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) dicarboxyl ligand through a liquid&#8208;phase epitaxial (LPE) layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) spraying method (named AIE surface&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks thin film, AIE&#8208;SURMOF). The obtained AIE&#8208;SURMOF Zn4O(TPE)3 (ZnTPE) has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property. Furthermore, by loading chiral guest in the MOF pore, the formed chiral encapsulated AIE&#8208;SURMOF can clearly indicate obvious circularly polarized luminescence performance with glum of 2.4&#215;10&#8208;3. This study provides new MOF thin film and new strategy for expanding function and application of MOF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Efficient and Stereoselective Aromatic and Dearomative Cope Rearrangements: Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of &#945;&#8208;Allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Aromatic &#947;&#8208;Lactone Derivatives.</title>

         <dc:description>
Fine&#8208;tuning substituents of the 1,5&#8208;hexadiene motif supported by calculations enable the stereoselective dearomative or aromatic Cope rearrangements of &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8242;&#8208;heteroaromatic lactones, overcoming the drastic thermodynamic and kinetic requirements of such reactions.







Abstract
The aromatic Cope rearrangement is an elusive transformation that has been the subject to of a limited number of investigations compared to those seemingly close analogues, namely the Cope and aromatic Claisen rearrangement. Herein we report our investigations inspired by moderate success observed in the course of pioneering works. By careful experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate that key substitutions on 1,5&#8208;hexadiene scaffold allow fruitful transformations. Especially, efficient functionalisation of the heteroaromatic rings results from the aromatic Cope rearrangement, while highly stereoselective interrupted aromatic Cope rearrangements highlight the formation of chiral compounds through a dearomative process.

         <title>Advances Toward Amphidinolides C, F and U: Isolations, Synthetic Studies and Total Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphidinolides C, F, and U, including C2&#8208;C4 analogs, are highly cytotoxic marine macrolides, mainly isolated from dinoflagellates of the genus Amphidinium. All these polyketides share a 75% or more similar structure, highlighted by a macrolactone ring, at least one trans&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted&#8208;THF motif and a characteristic polyenic side chain. From their isolation and absolute configurational assignment, the total synthesis of these marine macrolides represented an intense challenge to the organic synthesis community over the last 15 years, with around 14 research groups engaged in this inspiring task. In the first part of this review, we present the different approaches to the isolation and characterization of these natural products, including the most recent analogs, which may cast doubt on the biogenetic origin of these compounds. The various synthetic approaches to the total synthesis of C, F, and U amphidinolides are presented in a second part, focusing on key reactions and/or innovative strategies. The review concludes in a third section summarizing the successful approaches leading to the total synthesis of one of the members of this amphidinolide subfamily.</dc:description>

         <title>From Stilbenes to carbo&#8208;Stilbenes: an Encouraging Prospect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beyond previously described carbo&#8208;naphthalene and carbo&#8208;biphenyl, a novel type of bis&#8208;carbo&#8208;benzenic molecules is envisaged from the stilbene parent. The synthesis, structure, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of two such carbo&#8208;stilbenes are described at complementary experimental and computational DFT levels. In the selected targets, the bare skeletal carbo&#8208;mer of carbo&#8208;stilbene is decorated by 8 or 10 phenyl groups, 0 or 2 tert&#8208;butyl groups, and 2 n&#8208;octyl chains, the later substituents being introduced to compensate anticipated solubility issues. As in the parent stilbene series, isomers of the phenylated carbo&#8208;stilbenes are characterized. The cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers are formed in almost equal amounts and could not be separated by either chromatography or crystallization. Nevertheless, due to a slow interconversion at the NMR time scale (up to 55&#176;C) the 1H NMR signals of both isomers of the two carbo&#8208;stilbenes could be tentatively assigned. The calculated structure of the cis&#8208;isomer exhibits a helical shape, consistent with the observed magnetic shielding of phenyl p&#8208;CH nuclei residing inside the shielding cone of the facing C18 ring. Spectroscopical, electrochemical and DFT calculations lead to the right characterization of the importance of the isomers and their substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected nucleotides as building blocks for enzymatic de novo RNA synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Besides being a key player in numerous, fundamental biological process, RNA also represents a versatile platform for the creation of therapeutic agents and efficient vaccines. The production of RNA oligonucleotides, especially those decorated with chemical modifications, cannot meet the exponential demand. Due to the inherent limits of solid&#8208;phase synthesis and in vitro transcription, alternative, biocatalytic approaches are in dire need to facilitate the production of RNA oligonucleotides. Here, we present a first step towards the controlled enzymatic synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides. We have explored the possibility of a simple protection step of the vicinal cis&#8208;diol moiety to temporarily block ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotides protected with acetals, particularly 2',3'&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene, are well&#8208;tolerated by the template&#8208;independent RNA polymerase PUP (polyU polymerase) and highly efficient coupling reactions can be achieved within minutes &#8211; an important feature for the development of enzymatic de novo synthesis protocols. Even though purines are not equally well&#8208;tolerated, these findings clearly demonstrate the possibility of using cis&#8208;diol&#8208;protected ribonucleotides combined with template&#8208;independent polymerases for the stepwise construction of RNA oligonucleotides.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating &#946;&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Atom&#8208;Transfer Radical Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction simultaneously forges carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;halogen bonds. However, frequently&#8208;used photosensitizers such as precious transition metal complexes, or organic dyes have limitations in terms of their potential toxicity and recyclability. Three &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediamines with variable transient photocurrent and photocatalytic activity have been prepared. A COF bearing electron&#8208;deficient Cl atoms displayed the highest photocatalytic activity toward the ATRA reaction of polyhalogenated alkanes to give halogenated olefins under visible light at room temperature. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibited good functional group tolerance and could be recycled without significant loss of activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea&#8208;comprising single core diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives: exploring the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and charge transport properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular electronics exploits the distinctive features stemming from non&#8208;covalent interactions, guiding the self&#8208;assembly of molecules to craft materials endowed with customized electronic functionalities. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded materials, characterized by their capacity to establish dynamic and stable networks, introduce an extra dimension to the development of supramolecular electronic systems.
This study presents a comparative analysis of two remarkably small semiconductors utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalized with urea units as hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs, strategically positioned at opposing ends of the conjugated core. We show how the subtle distinction in functionalization not only influences morphology and self&#8208;assembly dynamics via hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking formation, but also holds significant consequences for ultimate charge transport properties. Our observations into the interplay of noncovalent interactions provide valuable insights and strategic pathways for the design of novel materials with enhanced electronic characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>NiCo&#8208;LDH coupled with 2D ZIF&#8208;derived Co nitrogen doped carbon nanosheet arrays&#160;as a self&#8208;supporting electrocatalyst for detection of formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde is susceptible to illegal addition to foodstuffs to extend their shelf life due to its antimicrobial, preservative and bleaching properties. In this study, a self&#8208;supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core&#8208;shell heterostructure was prepared in situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8208;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8208;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo&#8208;LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo&#8208;LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo&#8208;LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8208;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1 &#956;M to 13 mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82 nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.</dc:description>

Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone provide (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran with excellent stereospecificity. In general, excellent yields (up to 95%) and enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee) were obtained. Furthermore, the resulting 1,1&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuran or phthalan was converted to corresponding chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides without losing the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Rich Heterocycles Derived from a Phosphadiazonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles that pair main group elements and nitrogen are extremely important within the &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials research community. Compared to the vast number of boron&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, those that include phosphorus are less common. Furthermore, the use of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen triple bonds of any type to prepare such compounds is unprecedented. Here, we pair pyridyl hydrazonide ligands with phosphadiazonium cations and demonstrate that the chelated Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the photophysical and redox properties observed for the resulting heterocycles. In doing so, we introduce a novel building block for the production of phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles that could find use in small molecule activation and catalysis or as the functional component of emerging organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Diarsene [L(MeO)GaAs]2 (L = HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar = 2,6iPr2C6H3, 4) reacts with MeOTf and MeNHC (MeNHC = 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to the diarsene [L(TfO)GaAs]2 (5) and the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L] (6). The NHC&#8208;coordination results in an inversion of the redox properties of the diarsene 4, which shows only a reversible reduction event at E1/2 = &#8722;2.06 V vs Fc0/+, whereas the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene 6 shows a reversible oxidation event at E1/2 = &#8722;1.31 V vs Fc0/+1.

         <title>On Haptotropic Rearrangements of Diphosphene and Diarsene Ligands in Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipnictenes of the type RE=ER (E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb, Bi) are the isovalence electronic heavier analogs of alkenes. Although diphosphenes and dipnictenes in general show a variety of binding modes in metal complexes, little is known about haptotropic shift reactions involving these ligands. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#951;2 to &#951;1 rearrangement of the dipnictene ligands in titanocene complexes of the type Cp2Ti(Pn2Ar2) (Pn = P, As; Ar&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;Me3&#8208;C6H2, Mes; 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, Dip; 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2, Tip), initiated by Lewis basic ligands (L = MeCN, PMe3, AdNC, CO). In the presence of L the dipnictene ligand changes its hapticity from &#951;2 to &#951;1 and complexes of the general form Cp2Ti(L)(Pn2Ar2) with a succinctly different electronic structure are obtained. Electronically, the new complexes are best described as biradicaloids with antiferromagnetically coupled (via a &#960;&#8208;bond) [Cp2TiIII]&#8226;+ and [Pn2Ar2]&#8226;&#8722; fragments. However, the biradical character of these systems is affected by the electronic features of the co&#8208;ligand and significantly decreases moving from PMe3/MeCN (&#963;&#8208;donors) to CNAd/CO (&#963;&#8208;donors/&#960;&#8208;acceptors).</dc:description>

         <title>Empowering Protein Engineering through Recombination of Beneficial Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review underscores the pivotal role of beneficial substitution recombination in customizing protein functionalities, showcasing diverse experimental and computational methodologies across a broad spectrum of case studies.







Abstract
Directed evolution stands as a seminal technology for generating novel protein functionalities, a cornerstone in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Today, with the development of various mutagenesis methods and advanced analytical machines, the challenge of diversity generation and high&#8208;throughput screening platforms is largely solved, and one of the remaining challenges is: how to empower the potential of single beneficial substitutions with recombination to achieve the epistatic effect. This review overviews experimental and computer&#8208;assisted recombination methods in protein engineering campaigns. In addition, integrated and machine learning&#8208;guided strategies were highlighted to discuss how these recombination approaches contribute to generating the screening library with better diversity, coverage, and size. A decision tree was finally summarized to guide the further selection of proper recombination strategies in practice, which was beneficial for accelerating protein engineering.

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a sustainable, solid&#8208;phase catalyst for fast and efficient oxidation of a wide range of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyls in continuous flow! The new approach enables successful oxidation of various alcohols, including previously unreactive primary alcohols, with minimal catalyst loadings and rapid product accessibility.







Abstract
One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.

         <title>From the Iron Pentacarbonyl Cation to Heteroleptic &#951;6&#8208;arene Carbonyls and bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene Cations</title>

Access to low valent iron chemistry: Substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]+[WCA]&#8722; generates bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+/2+([WCA]&#8722;)1/2 (arene=C6H6, C6H3Me3, C6H5F). Partial substitution gives the heteroleptic cations [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]+[WCA]&#8722; (arene=C6H6, C6H3Me3, C6H5F, mes*). These salts have been characterized by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR and XRD analysis as well as computational methods.







Abstract
Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]&#8901;+ (arene=1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)2]&#8901;+ was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) salt. Chemical electronation, i.&#8201;e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)2], whereas further deelectronation under CO&#8208;pressure leads to a dicationic three&#8208;legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)3]2+ salt with [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]&#8901;+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis&#8208;arene salts [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]2+([Al(ORF)4]&#8722;)2 (arene=1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis&#8208;arene cation salt [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+ salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C6H6)2]2+ salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.

Partial substitution gives the heteroleptic cations [Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[WCA]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (arene=C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F, mes*). These salts have been characterized by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR and XRD analysis as well as computational methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half-sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (arene=1,3,5-tri-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5-tri-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw-EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=C(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) salt. Chemical electronation, i.&#8201;e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], whereas further deelectronation under CO-pressure leads to a dicationic three-legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; salt with [Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis-arene salts [Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;([Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (arene=1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F-{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis-arene cation salt [Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[F-{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw-EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Sensors for Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing of benzene vapor is a hot spot due to the volatile drastic carcinogen even at trace concentration. However, achieving convenient and rapid detection is still a challenge. As a sort of functional porous materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed as detection sensors by adsorbing benzene vapor and converting it into other signals (fluorescence intensity/wavelength,&#160;chemiresistive, weight or color, etc.). Supramolecular interaction between benzene molecules and the host framework, aperture size/shape and structural flexibility are influential factors in the performance of MOF&#8208;based sensors. Therefore, enhancing the host&#8208;guest interactions between the host framework and benzene molecules, or regulating the diffusion rate of benzene molecules by changing the aperture size/shape and flexibility of the host framework&#160;to enhance the detection signal are effective strategies for constructing MOF&#8208;based sensors. This concept highlights several types of MOF&#8208;based sensors for the detection of benzene vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Lactones, Cyclopropanes and ATRA Products: Revealing the Role of Sodium Ascorbate
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry: A direct and mild photochemical synthesis of lactones, cyclopropanes and ATRA products, utilizing sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid as the halogen/hydrogen bonding mediator and irradiation at 370&#8197;nm, 390&#8197;nm or 427&#8197;nm LED as the irradiation source. A variety of iodo&#8208;reagents were activated via halogen or hydrogen bonding and reacted successfully with a number of alkenes without the use of an external photocatalyst, leading to products in good to excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated processes have received significant attention, since they have re&#8208;surfaced unconventional reactivity platforms, complementary to conventional polar chemistry. &#947;&#8208;Lactones and cyclopropanes are prevalent moieties, found in numerous natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods for their synthesis, light&#8208;mediated protocols are coming to the spotlight, although these are contingent upon the use of photoorgano&#8208; or metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we introduce a novel photochemical activation of iodo&#8208;reagents via the use of cheap sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid to enable their homolytic scission and addition onto double bonds. The developed protocol was applied successfully to the formal [3+2] cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, traditional atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions and the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step conversion of alkenes to cyclopropanes. In all cases, the desired products were obtained in good to high yields, while the reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated. Depending on the nature of the iodo&#8208;reagent, a halogen or a hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is formed, which initiates the process.

         <title>Synthesis of [1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes through Iodine&#8208;Mediated Sulfur Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method has been developed for [1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs), which are attracting a great deal of attention as organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The advantage of the method is its simplicity, namely, heating readily available 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur in the presence of molecular iodine. Iodine plays a very important role in the reaction, as discussed in the proposed reaction pathways.







Abstract
[1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8722;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfoxides were obtained in a simple procedure from sulfoxonium ylides, in a different reaction mode from the classical behaviour (geminal addition of a nucleophile and electrophile, followed by sulfoxide extrusion. Experimental studies give insight to the mechanism of the reaction, with a change in the RDS according with ylide substitution. Sulfur&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing organic compounds are quite attractive and important in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8211;80&#8201;% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.

         <title>(Diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine Oxide &#8211; A Diazoalkane Reagent for [3+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A safe and efficient method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide &#8211; a hereto unexplored diazoalkane reagent &#8211; is developed. The method is based on the diazotization of the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted amine (readily available in multigram quantities) in non&#8208;aqueous media. The protocol provides the target product as ca. 1.5 M CHCl3 solution which is stable at &#8211;18 &#176;C. The utility of the synthesized diazoalkane is illustrated by&#160;its [3+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;poor alkynes and alkenes providing the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines with moderate to good efficiency. In this view, the title compound represents and an important extension of medicinally relevant phosphine oxide reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting of G&#8211;quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main goal of this work was to elucidate the potential relevance of (radio)metal chelates of 99mTc and Re targeting G&#8208;quadruplex structures for the design of new tools for cancer theranostics. 99mTc provides the complexes with the ability to perform single&#8208;photon&#8208;emission computed tomography imaging studies, while the Re complexes should act as anticancer agents upon interaction with specific G4 DNA or RNA structures present in tumor tissues. Towards this goal, we have developed isostructural 99mTc(I) and Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes anchored by a pyrazolyl&#8208;diamine (Pz) chelator carrying a pendant pyridostatin (PDS) fragment as the G4&#8208;binding motif. The interaction of the PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) complex with different G4&#8208;forming oligonucleotides was studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET&#8208;melting assays. The results showed that the Re complex retained the ability to bind and stabilize G4&#8208;structures from different DNA or RNA sequences, namely those present on the SRC proto&#8208;oncogene and telomeric RNA (TERRA sequence). PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) showed low to moderate cytotoxicity in PC3 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines, as typically observed for G4&#8208;binders. Biodistribution studies of the congener PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;99mTc (12) in normal mice showed that the complex undergoes a fast blood clearance with a predominant hepatobiliary excretion, pointing also for a high in vitro stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Backside versus Frontside SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Triflates and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic substitution reactions are elementary reactions in organic chemistry that are used in many synthetic routes. By quantum chemical methods, we have investigated the intrinsic competition between the backside SN2 (SN2&#8208;b) and frontside SN2 (SN2&#8208;f) pathways using a set of simple alkyl triflates as the electrophile in combination with a systematic series of phenols and partially fluorinated ethanol nucleophiles. It is revealed how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the SN2&#8208;b pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual SN2&#8208;f substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles. Activation strain analyses disclose that the SN2&#8208;b pathway is favored for strong alcohol nucleophiles because of the well&#8208;known intrinsically more efficient approach to the electrophile resulting in a more stabilizing nucleophile&#8211;electrophile interaction. In contrast, the preference of weaker alcohol nucleophiles shifts to the SN2&#8208;f pathway, benefiting from a stabilizing hydrogen bond interaction between the incoming alcohol and the leaving group. This hydrogen bond interaction is strengthened by the increased acidity of the weaker alcohol nucleophiles, thereby steering the mechanistic preference toward the frontside SN2 pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Lung Ventilation Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Diethyl Ether Gas Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA&#8208;approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low&#8208;throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow&#8208;bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch&#8208;mode production of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogenous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1&#8208;liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub&#8208;second 2D MRI with up to 2x2 mm2 in&#8208;plane resolution using a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications. This feasibility demonstration paves the way for the use of inhalable diethyl ether as a gaseous contrast agent for pulmonary MRI applications using any clinical MRI scanner.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaction of [CuH(PPh3)]6 with 1 equiv of Tl(OTf) results in formation of [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf] ([1]OTf]), which can be isolated in good yields. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirms the presence of a rare Tl&#8211;H orbital interaction. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands of [1]+ includes 7.7 ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit effects from the heavy Tl atom.

         <title>The Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic Enolates for the Construction of Quaternary and Tetrasubstituted Stereogenic Centres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the catalytic asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, as a means of accessing congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres. In particular, strategies for the stereocontrolled access to acyclic enolate nucleophiles, as well as the impact of enolate geometry on the stereochemical outcome of allylic alkylation, are highlighted.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;This review describes the catalytic asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, as a means of accessing congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres. In particular, strategies for the stereocontrolled access to acyclic enolate nucleophiles, as well as the impact of enolate geometry on the stereochemical outcome of allylic alkylation, are highlighted.

         <title>Stability of the protactinium(V) mono&#8208;oxo cation probed by first&#8208;principle calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protactinium (Z=91) deviates from the neighboring actinides by forming PaO3+ in solution instead of PaO2+. Complex stability, evaluated through Gibbs free energy, favors PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; and SO42&#8722;, but not with OH&#8722;, F&#8722; and C2O42&#8722;. QTAIM and NBO analyses reveal a triple bond in Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond, with increased covalency Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; providing insights into protactinium's unique chemical behavior.







Abstract
This study explores the distinctive behavior of protactinium (Z=91) within the actinide series. In contrast to neighboring elements like uranium or plutonium, protactinium in the pentavalent state diverges by not forming the typical dioxo protactinyl moiety PaO2+ in aqueous phase. Instead, it manifests as a monooxo PaO3+ cation or a Pa5+. Employing first&#8208;principle calculations with implicit and explicit solvation, we investigate two stoichiometrically equivalent neutral complexes: PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) and Pa(OH)4(X), where X represents various monodentate and bidentate ligands. Calculating the Gibbs free energy for the reaction PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O)&#8594;Pa(OH)4(X), we find that the PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) complex is stabilized with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, and SO42&#8722; ligands, while it is not favored with OH&#8722;, F&#8722;, and C2O42&#8722; ligands. Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods reveal the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond as a triple bond, with significant contributions from the 5f and 6d shells. Covalency of the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond increases with certain ligands, such as Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. These findings elucidate protactinium's unique chemical attributes and provide insights into the conditions supporting the stability of relevant complexes.

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we confirmed the influence of oxidative byproducts of Li3YCl6 on its reduction potential and investigates its redox mechanism. Through combined characterization techniques and electrochemical measurements, it was discovered that when the cathode voltage surpassed the oxidation voltage of the electrolyte or in the presence of an exotic element&#8208;induced condition, the electrolyte underwent oxidation of the halide element, resulting in the absence of ligands. Simultaneously, such process generated LixYCl3+x with a distinct reduction potential compared to pristine Li3YCl6. The Y element within LixYCl3+x experienced reduction to a lower valence state during the discharge process. Consequently, such structural change led to a significant rise in interfacial impedance and a decline in the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, through this study, we analyse ten recognized TADF&#8208;active configurations using TD&#8208;DFT and Multiwfn. It validates El Sayed&#8242;s rule and visualizes charge transfer dynamics, exploring diverse sulfur oxidation states and phenothiazine substitutions to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds. Insights into rISC rates and dihedral angles contribute to a comprehensive understanding, guiding phenothiazine material design for experimentalists.







Abstract
This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach not only validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to &#916;EST values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules. By integrating rigorous computational analysis with practical implications, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.

         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions are powerful methods for preparing fluorinated molecules, however their development has been severely hampered by the challenge of activating strong C&#8722;F bonds without sequestering the released fluoride. Recently, several strategies have emerged that allow for C&#8722;F insertion of a range of fluorinated substrates. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key underlying concepts.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions, where an organic fragment formally inserts into a carbon&#8211;fluorine bond in a substrate, are highly attractive, yet largely unexplored, methods to prepare valuable fluorinated molecules. The inherent strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the resulting need for a large thermodynamic driving force to initiate C&#8722;F cleavage often leads to sequestering of the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. Recently, however, several groups have succeeded in overcoming this challenge, opening up the study of C&#8722;F insertion as an efficient and highly atom&#8208;economical approach to prepare fluorinated compounds. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key conceptual advances that allowed for both C&#8722;F bond cleavage and subsequent incorporation of the released fluoride into the product.

         <title>A Simple Manganese(I) Catalyst for the Efficient and Selective Hydrophosphination of Olefins with PH3, Primary, and Secondary Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn(I) amido complex with a tridentate P,N,N ligand, which is easily synthesized from commercially available chemicals, is a remarkable efficient (pre)catalyst for the hydrophosphination of alkenes using secondary and primary aryl and alkyl phosphines and even PH3 as reagents.







Abstract
A tridentate ligand L with a P,NH,N donor motif was synthesized in few steps from commercially available precursors. Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18&#8208;electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. After deprotonation of the NH group in the cationic complex unit, a neutral Mn(I) amido complex [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;H)] (2) is formed under loss of CO. Rearrangement of L&#8208;H leads to a trigonal bipyramidal structure in which the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 results in a dep&#8208;blue anionic complex fragment [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; (3). DFT calculations and a QTAIM analysis show that the amido complex&#8197;2 contains a Mn&#8208;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins. But the catalytic activity is low. However, the neutral amido complex&#8197;2 is an excellent catalyst and with loadings as low as 0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;%, turn over frequencies of &gt;40&#8217;000&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomatizing Methoxylation of Phenols and Naphthols: Synthetic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols and naphthols are dearomatized to methoxycyclohexadienones under simple and robust electrochemical conditions, in a green way without chemical oxidants. The mechanism of the reaction is established using density functional theory calculations, which also explain the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity for differently&#8208;substituted substrates.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxidative dearomatizing methoxylation of phenols and naphthols was developed. It provides an alternative route for the preparation of methoxycyclohexadienones, important and versatile synthetic intermediates, that eliminates the need for stoichiometric high&#8208;energy chemical oxidants and generates hydrogen as a sole by&#8208;product. The reaction proceeds in a simple constant current mode, in an undivided cell, and it employs standardized instrumentation. A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted phenols and 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side&#8208;reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only products resulting from [4+2] cycloaddition pathways were observed in the reactions of different isocyanates with aliphatic imines. The alternative [2+2] pathway is strongly disfavored, and the corresponding diazetidinone products were not observed. For imines incorporating a specifically located thioester group, acyl isocyanates and aryl isocyanates gave different final products. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;H. Altmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304272).

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off&#8208;nucleus isotropic shielding isosurfaces computed with DFT show that while the sulflower with eight thiophene rings follows Baird's rule by switching from aromatic in its electronic ground state to antiaromatic in its lowest triplet state, the sulfower with six thiophene rings disobeys the rule by becoming even more aromatic in its lowest triplet state.







Abstract
Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel's and Baird's rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the individual thiophene rings. To reduce its T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes considerably between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work, in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in longer chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring (or the pair of central rings); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.

The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; states in longer chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring (or the pair of central rings); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Promoted Reductive Amination of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Amines for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step reductive amination reaction between DNA&#8208;conjugated amines and aromatic, aliphatic, or heterocyclic aldehydes, utilising the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, borate buffer, and NaBH4. The methodology is applicable to a broad substrate scope, with regards to both on&#8208;DNA amine and aldehyde, and is fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing; it is a new method for secondary and tertiary amine formation in DEL synthesis.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a leading technology for hit identification in drug discovery projects as large, diverse libraries can be generated. DELs are commonly synthesised via split&#8208;and&#8208;pool methodology; thus, chemical transformations utilised must be highly efficient, proceeding with high conversions. Reactions performed in DEL synthesis also require a broad substrate scope to produce diverse, drug&#8208;like libraries. Many pharmaceutical compounds incorporate multiple C&#8722;N bonds, over a quarter of which are synthesised via reductive aminations. However, few on&#8208;DNA reductive amination procedures have been developed. Herein is reported the application of the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, to the on&#8208;DNA reductive amination of DNA&#8208;conjugated amines, yielding highly efficient conversions with a broad range of aldehydes, including medicinally relevant heterocyclic and aliphatic substrates. The procedure is compatible with DNA amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.

         <title>Chiral Bis&#8208;phosphate Macrocycles for Catalytic, Efficient, and Enantioselective Electrophilic Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of privileged catalytic scaffolds into a macrocyclic skeleton represents an attractive strategy to furnish supramolecular catalysis systems with enzyme&#8208;mimetic cavity and multi&#8208;site cooperation. Herein we reported the synthesis, structure, binding properties and catalytic application of a series of chiral bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles toward the challenging asymmetric electrophilic fluorination. With a large, integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites, these macrocycles exhibited good inclusion toward 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) dicationic ammoniums through complementary ion&#8208;pair and C&#8210;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O interactions, as confirmed by crystallographic and solution binding studies. In fluorocyclization of tryptamines with Selectfluor reagent which has a similar DABCO&#8208;based dicationic structure, only 2 mol% macrocycle catalyst afforded the desired pyrroloindoline products in moderate yields and up to 91% ee. For comparison, the acyclic mono&#8208;phosphate analogue gave obviously lower reactivity and enantioselectivity (&lt;20% ee), suggesting a remarkable macrocyclic effect. The high catalytic efficiency and superior stereocontrol were ascribed to the tight ion&#8208;pair binding and cavity&#8208;directed noncovalent interaction cooperation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical, (3,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (PyBTM), were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of PyBTM&#8208;PhPyBTM was at most 0.4% in various organic solvents. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals did not improve the PLQY. In the MesPyBTM&#8208;PhPyBTM&#8208;Mes, the mesityl group did not worked as an electron donor unlike the previously reported monoradical MesPyBTM. However, adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene did greatly improve it, and the PLQY of the PyBTM&#8208;(Hex2Ph)PyBTM was 7% in dichloromethane and acetone, and 12% in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film. Twisting p&#8208;phenylene linker by hexyl groups hindered the p&#8208;conjugation and suppressed the non&#8208;radiative decay of the excited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction and Formic Acid Oxidation by Formal Nickel(I) Complexes of Di&#8208;isopropylphenyl Bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene</title>

         <dc:description>Processing CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels stands as one of the most crucial tasks in addressing the global challenge of the greenhouse effect. In this study, we focused on the complex (dpp&#8208;bian)NiBr2 (where dpp&#8208;bian is di&#8208;isopropylphenyl bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene) as a precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 as the sole product. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the realization of a catalytically effective pattern requires the three&#8208;electron reduction of (dpp&#8208;bian)NiBr2. The chemically reduced complexes [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8208;bian)Ni(COD)]&#8211; and [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8208;bian)2Ni]&#8211; were synthesized and structurally characterized. Analyzing the data from the electron paramagnetic resonance study of the complexes in a solution, along with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, reveals that the spin density is predominantly localized at their metal centers. The superposition of trajectory maps of the electron density gradient&#160; field &#160;and the one&#8208;electron electrostatic force field, along with the atomic charges, discloses that, within the first coordination sphere, the interatomic charge transfer occurs from the metal atom to the ligand atoms and that the complex anions can thus be formally described by the general formulas (dpp&#8208;bian)2&#8211;Ni+(COD) and (dpp&#8208;bian)2&#8211;Ni+. It was shown that the reduced nickel complexes can be oxidized by formic acid; resulting from this reaction, the two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton addition product dpp&#8208;bian&#8208;2H is formed.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of NVO Cathodes with Varied Lattice NH4+ Content: Effect on Structural Evolution and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH4+ in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH4+ content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH4+ by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH4+ exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex&#8208;situ structural characterizations, and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH4+ content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides' structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high&#8208;performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH4+ in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH4+ content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH4+ by a one-step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH4+ exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex-situ structural characterizations, and in-situ X-ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH4+ content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides' structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high-performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
