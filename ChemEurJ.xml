         <title>Cyanobacterial Cyclic Peptides Containing cis&#8208;Pro Conformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanobacterial cyclic natural products are ribosomal or nonribosomal peptides, typically containing one or more proline residues. However, the presence and population of the cis&#8208;Pro conformation are not always explicitly stated in the literature. The two proline isomers can affect protein function and interactions. This review focuses on the NMR characteristics and biosynthetic logic of cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing cis&#8208;Pro dominant conformations, aiming to provide an overview of the cis&#8208;Pro conformations in cyanobacterial cyclic peptides.








ABSTRACT
More than 3,000 natural products have been identified from cyanobacteria. These natural products often displayed antiparasitic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities. Cyanobacterial cyclic natural products are ribosomal or nonribosomal peptides, typically containing one or more proline residues. However, the presence and population of the cis&#8208;Pro conformation are not always explicitly stated in the literature. The two proline isomers can affect protein function and interactions. This review focuses on the NMR characteristics and biosynthetic logic of cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing cis&#8208;Pro dominant conformations, aiming to provide an overview of the cis&#8208;Pro conformations in cyanobacterial cyclic peptides. We manually reviewed the chemical structures and NMR chemical shifts of 150 cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing proline residues, of which 51 cyclic peptides possessed cis&#8208;prolyl amide bonds. Furthermore, we explained the Pro cis/trans isomerism in cyclic peptides and discussed methods for better studying these Pro cis/trans conformations in the future.

         <title>Molecules and Linear Polymers With Incorporated Pillar[5]Arene Units: Enhanced Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a unique class of macrocyclic compounds, pillararenes have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their exceptional performance in complexing with AIEgens. This concept aims to consolidate recent research advancements and applications of pillararene&#8208;AIEgens systems, offering valuable insights for future investigations.








ABSTRACT
Pillar[n]arenes are a class of special macrocyclic compounds with rigid and porous structures, representing an important branch of host macrocycles in the field of supramolecular chemistry. Since their discovery in 2008, pillar[n]arenes have been in&#8208;depth applied in the field of biomedicine, such as molecular recognition, bio&#8208;imaging, and tumor detection, due to the enhancement of fluorescent signal when combining with chromophores. Over the past decade, many pillar[n]arene units&#8208;incorporated polymers have been synthesized and served as ideal polymer hosts for the enhancement of luminescent performance of applied to enhance aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) performance. Driven by researchers' keen exploration of pillararene polymers for AIE enhancement, this review will elaborate on the AIE&#8208;enhancing effects of pillararenes from two aspects: pillararene&#8208;containing monomers and pillararene&#8208;containing linear polymers. It also introduces the synthesis methods of pillararenes and the principles underlying their AIE&#8208;enhancing effects. Additionally, their applications in areas such as fluorescent sensing and artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems are presented. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of pillararenes are discussed.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective and Chemical Activation Strategies for Nitrogen Mustard Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Nitrogen mustards are highly potent DNA&#8208;alkylating agents, but their clinical utility is limited by systemic toxicity and poor tumor selectivity. Tumor&#8208;selective prodrug strategies have emerged to address these challenges, enabling spatiotemporally controlled activation of otherwise inert precursors. These approaches exploit tumor&#8208;specific cues such as hypoxia, acidic pH, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and redox imbalance, to achieve precise payload release. Stimulus&#8208;induced bond cleavage or structural transformation liberates the masked nitrogen mustard (NM) in situ, facilitating targeted DNA cross&#8208;linking. This review highlights molecular design principles underlying diverse activation strategies, emphasizing scaffold modifications and linker chemistries tailored to cancer&#8208;associated triggers. We also discuss integration with advanced delivery platforms, including polymeric carriers and nanoplatforms, to enhance tumor accumulation and therapeutic indices while minimizing off&#8208;target toxicity. By consolidating recent advances, this review illustrates how bioorthogonal and tumor&#8208;selective activation strategies, including those responsive to hypoxia, ROS, and pH, are redefining the precision oncology potential of NM prodrugs.

         <title>Structural Aspects of Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction in the Phosphidotitanate Li8TiP4 and Its Comparison With Li7+5xTa1&#8722;xP4 and Li8&#8722;xTi1&#8722;xTaxP4</title>

ABSTRACT
The chemical system Li/Ti/P has previously been subject to intensive investigation. However, reliable structural data for the reported phases have remained elusive. Motivated by the growing interest in phosphorus&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion conductors, we have reinvestigated the synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of Li8TiP4. Phase pure Li8TiP4 was obtained, which crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P42mc (no. 105) with a&#8201;=&#8201;8.37581(2)&#8201;&#197; and c&#8201;=&#8201;5.90489(2)&#8201;&#197;. According to a structure determination from X&#8208;ray diffraction powder data, Li8TiP4 is closely related to known Li8TtP4 with Tt&#8201;=&#8201;Si, Ge, and Sn, but adapts a different structure type. Basic structural findings are confirmed by solid state 6Li and 31P NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal a band gap of 2.5&#8201;eV and a good correlation between theoretical and experimental Raman spectra. From potentiostatic impedance spectroscopy an ion conductivity of (4.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;6&#8201;S&#8729;cm&#8722;1 at 298&#8201;K was found. In addition to the investigation of ternary Li8TiP4, an isotypic quaternary Ta&#8208;containing phase is observed and studied by single crystal structure determination. Special emphasis in this study is placed on the role of Li occupancy in the voids of the cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) P atom arrangement and its impact on the ionic conductivity, in comparison to the known compounds Li7+5xTaxP4 and Li8&#8722;xTi1&#8722;xTaxP4 and traced back to the difference in crystal symmetry. Possible diffusion pathways of the Li+ ions were approached by BVSE calculations.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Sequestration of Oxoanions: Detoxification of Cr(VI) and Immobilization of TcO4&#8722; at ppb Level in Aqueous Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A guanidinium&#8208;based redox&#8208;active porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;3) enables the selective removal of carcinogenic chromate and radioactive pertechnetate from water below their WHO safety limit. The incorporation of a thiophene moiety facilitates Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), while the guanidium moiety facilitates electrostatic interactions and ion exchange governs oxoanions binding.








ABSTRACT
Metal oxoanions present significant challenges because of their high solubility in water and their charge characteristics. Among these, carcinogenic chromate and radioactive pertechnetate are particularly concerning. Conventional adsorbents often suffer from low recyclability and reduced selectivity to remove oxoanionic pollutants. Herein, we report a guanidinium&#8208;based porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;3) that selectively adsorbs CrO42&#8722;and TcO4&#8722; from real&#8208;life water samples. POF&#8208;3 displays maximum adsorption capacities of 123&#160;mg g&#8722;1 for chromate and 177&#160;mg g&#8722;1 for perrhenate at pH&#160;=&#160;6. The removal efficiency of POF&#8208;3 at low concentrations of chromate and pertechnetate is very far below the corresponding EPA limit. The adsorption mechanism mainly follows electrostatic interaction and the ion exchange mechanism. Reducing carcinogenic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is a crucial step; introducing thiophene in the structural backbone of POF&#8208;3 facilitates the redox properties. Morphological transformation into a sheet&#8208;like structure confirms the effective sorption of chromate and perrhenate. In this context, NMR titration of monomeric compound also suggests interaction of POF&#8208;3(M) with guanidium sites of material towards chromate and perrhenate effectively, as proven by solid phase study. These effective adsorption capacities, faster kinetics, and ion exchange ability make it a promising solution for environmental remediation.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Chemistry: An Emerging Strategy for Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in the application of bioorthogonal chemistry in targeted protein degradation (TPD). It discusses how bioorthogonal chemistry and its integration with other technologies address the limitations of TPD agents, providing insights into future applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in TPD.








ABSTRACT
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technologies represent a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance associated with traditional small&#8208;molecule inhibitors (SMIs) while targeting traditionally considered nondruggable targets. However, the frequent noncompliance of TPD agents with Lipinski's &#8220;Rule of Five&#8221; poses significant druggability challenges. Off&#8208;target toxicity and the &#8220;hook effect&#8221; further limit TPD applications. With the development of bioorthogonal chemistry, self&#8208;assembly TPD agents and TPD agent prodrugs based on bioorthogonal chemistry offer a viable solution to address these issues. This review summarizes recent advances in integrating bioorthogonal chemistry with TPD technologies, specifically highlighting its role in improving conventional TPD agents drawbacks.

Site&#8208;selective activation and borylation of para C&#9472;H bonds pose a significant challenge; however, this transformation can be accomplished through the strategic use of weak noncovalent interactions. This concept article provides a detailed overview of these emerging strategies.








ABSTRACT
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H borylation has garnered significant attention from the scientific community, as organoboron compounds serve as important synthetic intermediates that can be utilized in various subsequent transformations while maintaining high selectivity. Among the three types of C&#9472;H bonds, the activation and borylation of para C&#9472;H bonds present the greatest challenge due to their largest distance from the functional group. Nevertheless, the activation of this bond can be achieved through the use of various weak noncovalent interactions. In recent years, numerous strategies have been developed that leverage these weak interactions for iridium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective C&#9472;H borylation. This concept article offers a detailed overview of these strategies, organized by the types of noncovalent interactions involved, while also discussing the progress, challenges, and future directions in this domain.

The photochemical side of cyclopropenes. Cyclopropenes are valuable synthetic tools in organic chemistry. In particular, this review focuses on the photochemistry of cyclopropenes. The reactivity of cyclopropenes excited by irradiation is discussed showing their unique potential for organic synthesis. Moreover, reactions of cyclopropenes at ground state with other photo&#8208;excited molecules is also presented, including recent applications in bioorthogonal reactions.








ABSTRACT
This review covers the reactivity of cyclopropenes under light irradiation. Cyclopropenes have a formidable and complex photochemistry. While fundamental photochemistry of cyclopropenes was early studied, the synthetic potential has not been developed at comparable pace as synthetic photochemistry has recently evolved. In this review, the main types of light&#8208;mediated reactivity of cyclopropenes is briefly presented and focus on the synthetic possibilities offered by these reactions. Moreover, photochemical reactions in which cyclopropenes at ground state react with other photo&#8208;excited molecules are also presented. Finally, the value of cyclopropenes in a different field as light&#8208;mediated bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions is succinctly introduced.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Organic Electrode Materials: Regulating Molecular Orbital Energy Levels Toward Efficient Dual&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept highlights the emerging role of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecular engineering in addressing two intrinsic challenges for organic electrode materials in dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs): insufficient active&#8208;site density and intrinsically low electronic conductivity. The structure&#8211;property relationships of D&#8208;A organic electrode materials have been analyzed that enabling simultaneous improvements in energy and power density. Concrete research directions for D&#8208;A organic electrodes for practical DIB applications have been proposed.








ABSTRACT
Organic electrode materials (OEMs)&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have emerged as next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their high operational voltage, environmental benignity, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, conventional OEMs remain constrained by poor conductivity and insufficient active sites, resulting in inadequate energy/power density for practical applications. This concept focuses on the design and implementation of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structured organic electrodes, with a comprehensive review of their performance optimization mechanisms and research advancements in DIBs. Molecular D&#8208;A engineering enables precise modulation of electronic structures, energy&#8208;level alignment, and charge transport pathways, substantially enhancing electrode redox activity, conductivity, and ion storage kinetics. Finally, the future research directions of DIBs and system compatibility studies are prospected, and a theoretical framework and technical roadmaps for the development of high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density organic DIBs are presented.

         <title>A Multivariate Correlation Analysis Method Identifying Key Synthetic Parameters of Nickel Nanocatalysts Active in H2 Production From Ammonia&#8208;Borane Solvolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodological approach based on a multivariate correlation analysis is described and employed to decipher prevalent parameters in the efficient synthesis of active colloidal nickel nanocatalysts used in H2 delivery from hydrolysis and methanolysis of ammonia&#8208;borane under mild conditions. This textbook example illustrates how to apply data science to formalize catalyst optimization for a given reaction.








ABSTRACT
The control of the properties of functional nanoparticles (NPs) requires rational adjustment of the parameters in their synthesis. However, the systematic study of all the experimental parameters for a given protocol generates data that can be intricate to handle and interpret. We address herein the development of a methodological approach to optimizing synthesis/structure of functional nanoobjects. Principal component analysis and correlation matrix evidence the prevalent synthetic parameters and their possible correlation. We develop 2D&#8208;size plots visual graphic tool from statistical treatment of NPs by microscopy. We applied these tools in a textbook case dedicated to the synthesis of colloidal Ni nanocatalysts used for H2 delivery from the solvolysis of ammonia&#8208;borane (AB) under mild conditions. As a result of the multivariate correlation analysis approach, we established the key role of the precursor nature in the synthesis, that mainly governed the size, dispersity and crystallinity of the formed NPs. At different examination scale, the clustering analysis of subpopulation of formed NPs or the electronic topology analysis of the molecular precursors were achieved. The difference in nanocatalysts performances is correlated to differences in crystallinity, which in turn comes from the nature of the precursors used. The methodological approach proposed here, focused at colloidal Ni NPs used for H2 delivery, reinforces the role of data science for the development and optimization of nanomaterials.

         <title>Iridium Complexes Based on 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]Phenanthroline Ligand: Photophysical Properties and Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Characterization</title>

ABSTRACT
Cyclometallated Ir(III) complexes are extensively used in luminescent devices such as Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs) due to their high stability and also high luminescence quantum yields. To increase the promising complexes for LEC applications, efforts are focused on the design of molecules with specific ligands that can modulate the emission color as well as the nature of the excited state from which radiative decays occur. In this context, this work presents a study of the luminescent properties of two new Ir(III) complexes containing a ligand derived from 1H&#8208;imidazo[4, 5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline (dmbip). This study, complemented by theoretical DFT calculations and electrochemical characterizations, shows that, in solution, both Ir(III) complexes exhibit the same emission energy as that of the free dmbip ligand. However, in the solid state, the complexes exhibit phosphorescent emission with a marked red shift of nearly 100&#160;nm relative to their performance in solution. This unusual behavior is due to the presence of a luminescent 3ILCT excited state in the solid state, whose population is favored by the heavy metal center. Furthermore, these complexes were characterized in LEC devices and displayed the same emission profile identified in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence.

         <title>Mechanistic and DFT Insights Into Co&#8208;Catalytic MgFe&#8208;LDH/Hematite Interfaces for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin MgFe&#8208;LDH nanosheets serve as an effective OER co&#8208;catalyst for &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes, boosting photocurrent by 4.6 times and lowering the onset potential by 340&#160;mV. DFT calculations attribute this to a reduced kinetic energy barrier at the LDH active sites.








ABSTRACT
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are low&#8208;cost and versatile materials, many of which are well&#8208;established water oxidation electrocatalysts. A simple MgFe&#8208;LDH variant, synthesized as size&#8208;tunable nanosheets, was successfully decorated on the surface of hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) nanorods to structure an integrating photoanode for improved photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. Combined XPS and SEM analysis showed that MgFe&#8208;LDH decoration does not interfere with the nanostructure of the light&#8208;harvesting &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3. However, intensified Raman bands for the decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 pointed to enhanced interactions between MgFe&#8208;LDH and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3. Optimization of the surface amount for MgFe&#8208;LDH can lead to a 340&#160;mV cathodic shift in the onset potential at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Mott&#8208;Schottky analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further revealed that LDH decoration enhances the photogenerated charge&#8208;carrier separation and efficiently consumes holes accumulating at the electrode surface. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a lower Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) value of 1.35&#160;eV for MgFe&#8208;LDH/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 contrasted to pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 (&#916;G of&#160;1.46&#160;eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS), further indicating that the MgFe&#8208;LDH co&#8208;catalyst lowers the activation energy barrier for the OER. This work offers a promising method for designing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost hematite&#8208;based photoanodes for solar&#8208;fuel devices relying on noncritical elements.

         <title>Spectroscopic Fingerprinting of Coordination&#8208;driven Spin States in Metal&#8208;organic Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>

Coordination geometry controls spin states in Co&#8208;TCNQ frameworks. Combined theory and XAS confirm the high&#8208;spin Co2+ on graphene and establish a direct approach for spin&#8208;state assignment in metal&#8208;organic systems.








ABSTRACT
Determining the local geometry of metal&#8208;organic architecture on substrates is challenging, as substrate interactions can alter the metal coordination relative to the free&#8208;standing structure. Here, combining density functional theory (DFT) and restricted open&#8208;shell configuration interaction with singles (ROCIS) calculations on isolated cobalt&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (Co&#8208;TCNQ) complexes, together with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), directly reveals the coordination motifs of Co centers in a 2D Co&#8208;TCNQ framework on graphene. The calculated Co L3,2&#8208;edges spectroscopic fingerprints for nearly planar (Co2+, S = 1/2) and distorted tetrahedral (Co2+, S = 3/2) structures exhibit distinct features, allowing unambiguous assignment of spin and oxidation states of the metal centers, as well as confirmation of the local geometry. Comparison with experimental spectra confirms that the high&#8208;spin tetrahedral geometry is realized in the supported framework, demonstrating how spectroscopic fingerprints can directly link coordination geometry to spin and oxidation states in low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic systems.

         <title>Construction of Heterostructure Pseudocapacitive Electrode VN/MnOx on Carbon Sheet Synthesized by C3N4 Self&#8208;Sacrifice Method for Supercapacitors</title>

ABSTRACT
Vanadium nitride (VN) is considered as a promising electrode for supercapacitors, however, its easy oxidation and dissolution limited application widely. We proposed to construct a heterostructure pseudocapacitive electrode, VN/MnOx, on a carbon sheet synthesized by C3N4 self&#8208;sacrifice method for supercapacitors. This method can avoid NH3 using and at the same time produce carbon material. The manganese content can be adjusted to decrease the bandgap, resulting in conductivity improvements and fast electrochemical kinetic, then enhancing the electrochemical performance. The optimized C/VN/MnOx can deliver a maximum specific capacitance of 424 F g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, higher than C/VN&#8208;700 (150 F g&#8722;1). Further, the assembled Ni(OH)2//C/VN/MnOx&#8208;700&#8208;1 device also exhibits high energy density of 37.05&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, with an excellent cycle life of 84% after 20,000 cycles, which will further promote the application of VN in supercapacitors. This work provides a new method of ammonia&#8208;free synthesis route and constructs a heterostructure pseudocapacitive electrode to achieve high specific capacitance, advancing the practical application of VN&#8208;based materials in high&#8208;performance supercapacitors.

         <title>Remote Chirality Transfer and Amplification in a Self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene</title>

         <dc:description>
A C3 symmetrical &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene containing monomer self&#8208;assembles into helical fibres with remarkable remote chirality transfer and amplification, which greatly enhanced its CPL activity both in the assemblies and in the solid state. Energy transfer relay systems with dyes effectively harvest the energy and further enhance the CPL of the assemblies.








ABSTRACT
Chirality transfer and amplification are prevailing in biological systems, which play vital roles in the homochirality of life. Systems with remote chirality transfer and amplification remain actively pursued, aiming to construct novel chiral materials for advanced applications. Chiral supramolecular assembly stands out as a promising way to construct molecular assemblies through multiple synergistic noncovalent interactions, which enable the construction of various chiral materials. Here, we have developed a novel chiral monomer that was able to self&#8208;assemble in nonpolar solvents and afforded chiral fibers. The self&#8208;assembly process was found to be tuned by solvent composition and concentration. The self&#8208;assembly kinetics were affected by solvents and concentrations as well. The chirality can be transferred from the remote chiral center at the peripheries of the compound to the center of the molecule and was amplified during the self&#8208;assembly process via helical stacking of the adjacent monomers. Furthermore, CPL and energy transfer relay systems were also successfully realized with the chiral self&#8208;assemblies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Top&#8208;Interface Passivation Using a Thiohydantoin Derivative for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective multi&#8208;functional passivation strategy by utilizing 3&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Thiohydantoin&#8208;5&#8208;Propionic Acid (PTGA) as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator. The &#8208;NH&#8208; moieties in PTGA can repair anionic surface defects through hydrogen bonding, whereas its C = O of &#9472;COOH groups functionalities effectively coordinate uncoordinated Pb2+ cations, thus passivating cationic defects.








ABSTRACT
The efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are primarily limited by substantial nonradiative recombination losses at the interfaces, particularly the perovskite (PVK)/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. Here, we introduce a versatile passivation strategy that employs a multifunctional molecule, 3&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Thiohydantoin&#8208;5&#8208;Propionic Acid (PTGA), as an interlayer at PVK/ETL interface. The &#9472;NH&#9472; moieties in PTGA can repair anionic surface defects through hydrogen bonding, whereas its carbonyl (C = O) functionalities in &#9472;COOH effectively passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ cations. This cooperative action leads to a marked decrease in interfacial defect concentration. As a result, the approach improves the crystallinity of the active layer, optimizes energy band alignment, boosts electron extraction efficiency, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. The treated inverted solar cells deliver a champion efficiency of 25.13% with improved long&#8208;term storage stability and persistent light illumination stability, substantially outperforming their untreated counterparts. This work provides a profound mechanistic understanding of multisite molecular passivation and delivers a simple yet effective strategy to advance the commercial prospects of perovskite photovoltaics.

The design and synthesis of a linear tetradentate NCCN ligand incorporating two 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene donors, and its application to asymmetric iron catalysis is reported. This work represents the first example of an iron complex derived from a cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;coordinating tetradentate NCCN ligand, and notably, the first chiral iron catalyst derived from an achiral tetradentate ligand.








ABSTRACT
Ligand design plays a crucial role in developing chiral transition metal complexes with enhanced or new catalytic properties. Here, we report our progress toward a new class of linear tetradentate NCCN ligands incorporating strongly &#963;&#8208;donating carbene moieties. The NCCN ligand coordinates to iron(II) in a cis&#8208;&#945; topology, with two pyridine donors occupying the apical positions and two 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene (MIC) donors in the equatorial plane. Two acetonitrile ligands complete the octahedral coordination sphere, and their lability provides the basis for the observed catalytic activity. Notably, the two strongly &#963;&#8208;donating MIC groups create a strong ligand field, which is critical for achieving configurational stability of the metal&#8208;centered stereogenicity. This design strategy thus enabled the first chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron catalyst derived from an achiral tetradentate ligand, which was applied to catalytic and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination and a Cannizzaro reaction.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Crosslinking Polymers With Multiple Ruthenium Centers for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
As cathode materials for nitrate reduction (NO3RR), covalently cross&#8208;linked supramolecular electrocatalysts demonstrate high performance: Under alkaline conditions at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE, the NH3 yield is 8.72&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 78.5%. In neutral electrolyte, the NH3 yield rate is 7.45&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 accompanied by a FENH3 of 83.8%.








ABSTRACT
Possessing multiple catalytic sites, supramolecular polymers have received attention due to their desirable electrocatalytic activity for ammonia synthesis from NO3&#175;. Herein, a covalently cross&#8208;linked supramolecular catalytic system (Ru@POP&#8208;CD) was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction between ruthenium&#8208;coordinated phenanthroline cyclodextrin and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile, which is not only efficiently electrocatalytic for ammonia synthesis from nitrate but also provides an effective way to combat environmental pollution. Different from noncovalently cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polymers, Ru@POP&#8208;CD could be kept on the electrode for cycle use and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 78.5% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in 0.1&#160;M KNO3/0.1&#160;M KOH solution, with a NH3 yield rate of 8.72&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This superior electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the unique cyclic structure with rich hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin, effective affinity for anionic nitrate through hydrogen bonding and the synergistic interaction of Ru tunable d&#8208;orbitals, facilitating the electroreduction of nitrate at the electrode. Meanwhile, in neutral electrolyte (0.1&#160;M KNO3/0.05&#160;M K2SO4), Ru@POP&#8208;CD still possesses highly efficient catalytic performance, with the NH3 yield rate of 7.45&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and FENH3 of 83.8% at &#8722;0.9&#160;V versus RHE, showing great potential in electrochemical energy supply systems.

&lt;p&gt;As cathode materials for nitrate reduction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR), covalently cross-linked supramolecular electrocatalysts demonstrate high performance: Under alkaline conditions at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE, the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield is 8.72&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;) of 78.5%. In neutral electrolyte, the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate is 7.45&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; accompanied by a FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt; of 83.8%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possessing multiple catalytic sites, supramolecular polymers have received attention due to their desirable electrocatalytic activity for ammonia synthesis from NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#175;&lt;/sup&gt;. Herein, a covalently cross-linked supramolecular catalytic system (&lt;b&gt;Ru@POP-CD&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction between ruthenium-coordinated phenanthroline cyclodextrin and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile, which is not only efficiently electrocatalytic for ammonia synthesis from nitrate but also provides an effective way to combat environmental pollution. Different from noncovalently cross-linked supramolecular polymers, &lt;b&gt;Ru@POP-CD&lt;/b&gt; could be kept on the electrode for cycle use and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;) of 78.5% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in 0.1&#160;M KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/0.1&#160;M KOH solution, with a NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 8.72&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Metal Encapsulation Engineered Aromaticity Modulation: Transforming Cyclo[16]Carbon From Dual Antiaromaticity to Conflicting or Dual Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 3, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations demonstrate aromaticity modulation in C16 via metal encapsulation, establishing a paradigm for precise aromaticity engineering in carbon nanorings.








ABSTRACT
The inherent instability of a recently synthesized cyclo[16]carbon (C16) ring, arising from its dual antiaromatic 4n &#960;&#8208;electron systems, is strategically mitigated through encapsulation of light lanthanides (La&#8208;Nd) and actinide metals (Th&#8208;Np). This approach transforms C16&#8217;s dual antiaromaticity into tunable aromatic or conflicting aromatic states. The magnitude of aromatic character induced by metal encapsulation reveals an evolution trend that correlates with metal reducibility, thereby offering insights into the interactions between f&#8208;block metals and carbon&#8208;based materials. Multifaceted computational analyses, including topological, natural population, interaction region indicator (IRI), and spin density assessments, demonstrate that metal confinement fundamentally reconstructs the &#960; electron distribution. Crucially, light actinides (Th&#8208;Np) impart dual aromaticity through uniform electron delocalization and bond&#8208;length equalization, while lanthanides (La&#8208;Nd) induce conflicting aromaticity. Frontier molecular orbital and magnetically induced current analyses provide definitive evidence for these metal&#8208;dependent electronic transitions. We thus establish a metal&#8208;encapsulation paradigm for precise aromaticity engineering in carbon nanorings, unlocking transformative pathways for&#160;tailored quantum materials and single&#8208;molecule electronics.

         <title>1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition: A Potentially Valuable Synthetic Tool</title>

A brief summary on the concept development, recent advances, application, mechanism, and perspective on the limitation and future trend is described for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reaction as a newly emerged transformation pathway.








ABSTRACT
Different from well&#8208;known 1,4&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reactions, umpolung 1,5&#8208;addition is considered electronically mismatched and is rarely explored. With palladium hydride catalysis, 1,5&#8208;addition was recently proved to be feasible. Diverse types of C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;based nucleophiles can be enantioselectively introduced to the &#947;&#8208;position of electron&#8208;deficient conjugated dienes. A series of privileged cyclic structures can also be conveniently prepared through 1,5&#8208;addition&#8208;involved cascade processes with high stereocontrol. This article provides a perspective on the concept development and advancement of 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition, which has gradually emerged as a new synthetic model.

         <title>Making and Breaking: Supramolecular Chirality Modulation via Stepwise Assembly and Disassembly of Nano&#8208;Size Trizinc(II)Porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates the induction of chirality in a nano&#8208;size achiral trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer (host) through sequential addition of chiral diamino esters (substrates, L) through the stepwise formation of polymer and dimer via intermolecular assembling and disassembling processes, respectively.








ABSTRACT
A molecular&#8208;level understanding of supramolecular chirality amplification and attenuation is established through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; achiral Zn(II)porphyrin trimer (host) and a series of chiral diamino esters (substrates). The processes occur through the stepwise formation of polymer and dimer via intermolecular assembling and disassembling processes, respectively. Crystallographic characterizations of both the polymer and dimer allow systematic scrutiny of their structural changes, elucidating their chiroptical properties. The electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectra display opposite signs for the R and S substrates in both the polymer and dimer, indicating that the chirality of the complexes are dictated solely by the absolute configuration of the substrate. In the dimer, both intra&#8208; and intermolecular couplings were identified while in the polymer, CD signals were significantly amplified, owing to cumulative intermolecular couplings. DFT and TDDFT studies corroborate these experimental findings and provide valuable insights into the origin of the chiroptical responses, amplification and reduction in these systems.

         <title>Copper&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Active Methylene Isocyanides: Facile Access to Highly Substituted Five&#8208; and Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of active methylene isocyanides for the synthesis of highly substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Emphasis is placed on [3+n] cycloadditions, annulations, and asymmetric strategies, highlighting current limitations and future opportunities in heterocycle construction.








ABSTRACT
Copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of active methylene isocyanides provide powerful and versatile strategies for the construction of heterocyclic architectures relevant to pharmaceutical and materials science. Owing to their unique ambiphilic reactivity, active methylene isocyanides serve as key building blocks for the synthesis of fused, bicyclic, polycyclic, and spirocyclic heterocycles under mild catalytic conditions. This review summarizes recent advances in the copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed transformation of functionalized isocyanides toward multi&#8208;substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocyclic frameworks. Particular emphasis is placed on [3+n] cycloaddition reactions, as well as tandem processes involving cycloaddition, annulation, alkylation, and insertion pathways. In addition, emerging strategies that exploit nonfunctionalized isocyanides, strained alkene surrogates, and multi&#8208;isocyanide reaction manifolds are discussed, highlighting new opportunities for complexity generation and asymmetric heterocycle synthesis.

         <title>Rational Design Strategies for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive DNAzymes Using Modified and Artificial Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity control of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in response to external stimuli has attracted growing interest for applications in DNA&#8208;based diagnostics, therapeutics, and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. This review summarizes rational design strategies for stimuli&#8208;responsive DNAzymes using modified or artificial nucleotides, including split and caged DNAzymes, as well as systems that undergo stimuli&#8208;induced structural transformations.








ABSTRACT
DNA, traditionally regarded as genetic material, has emerged as a versatile building block in molecular technology. Catalytic DNA oligomers known as DNAzymes, especially those capable of cleaving target RNA at specific sites, have shown great potential in DNA&#8208;based diagnostics, therapeutics, and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. For advanced applications, stimuli&#8208;responsive DNAzymes, which are activated only under specific conditions or by specific chemical stimuli, have attracted particular attention. Although such DNAzymes can be obtained by in vitro selection under strictly controlled conditions, more general strategies for their rational design are strongly needed. In this approach, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is introduced into existing DNAzymes by sequence engineering or chemical modification. This review focuses on the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes using modified and artificial nucleotides. Here, we discuss representative strategies, including recent examples: (i) stimulus&#8208;induced reconstitution of split DNAzymes, (ii) activity control by strand cleavage or ligation, (iii) blocking of the catalytic core with removable oligonucleotides, (iv) caging with labile protecting groups, and (v) stimuli&#8208;induced conformational switching between inactive and active structures. These approaches enable externally controllable activation mechanisms, while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic activity of DNAzymes, providing a valuable toolkit for molecular sensing and DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Operando Magic Angle Spinning Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy of Methanol Photoreforming Over Titania&#8208;Coated Silica Monoliths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreforming of methanol is followed in real time by solid&#8208;state Magic Angle Spinning NMR. The transparent sapphire sample holder is irradiated by four LEDs at 11.5&#160;kHz MAS. Efficient light penetration into the sample volume is ensured by silica monoliths with a network of macropores, coated with TiO2, and enhancing light penetration by a factor of two. Silica monoliths may be a versatile support for photo&#8208;irradiated operando solid&#8208;state NMR.








ABSTRACT
Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) is one of the most powerful analytic techniques and in principle the method of choice to elucidate with molecular detail all components of complex solid or solid&#8208;liquid samples. MAS NMR under light irradiation is yet little developed, with technical solutions and first applications just emerging. We present the first operando observation of photoreforming of methanol to formaldehyde in a transparent rotor, irradiated at 365&#160;nm by four LEDs, at spinning rates up to 11.5&#160;kHz. The photon flux inside the rotor is quantified by an actinometric reaction. Efficient light penetration into the entire rotor volume is crucial. Therefore, we introduce silica monoliths with a continuous network of macropores, coated with TiO2 (anatase) as supported heterogeneous catalyst. These monoliths provide a large pore volume to accommodate the liquid substrate and a high surface area. Centrally, the network of pores larger than the visible light enhances light penetration into the material by a factor of two compared to a powder. Silica monoliths may be easily decorated with various photocatalysts and thus provide a versatile platform for observing in real time photocatalytic reactions by solid&#8208;state NMR.

         <title>Mini&#8208;Hairpin DNA: Extraordinarily Stable Structure and Its Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mini&#8208;hairpin DNA fragments containing GCGAAGC and GCGAAAGC form exceptionally stable hairpin&#8208;like structures, with only two G&#8722;C pairs and one sheared G&#8722;A pair, remaining undenatured in 7&#160;M urea and resisting nuclease digestion. These mini&#8208;hairpin sequences frequently appear in replication and transcription origins, influence DNA sequencing fidelity, and are applicable for stabilizing versatile nucleic acid functional molecules.








ABSTRACT
Nucleic acids exhibit diverse biological functions through hierarchical structural organization, and higher&#8208;order architectures enable recognition beyond Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of an unusual, extraordinarily stable motif&#8212;mini&#8208;hairpin DNA&#8212;a compact hairpin structure composed of GCGNNAGC or GCGNAGC sequences (N = A, G, C, or T). About 40 years ago, we serendipitously found this unique structure from unusual mobility in denaturing gel electrophoresis. The tertiary structure of GCGAAGC was determined by NMR and contains two G&#8722;C pairs and one sheared G&#8722;A pair. Despite only three base pairs, the mini&#8208;hairpin structure remains nondenatured even in 7&#160;M urea. This thermal stability cannot be accounted for by conventional thermodynamic or structural models and remains unexplained by current molecular dynamics predictions. In addition to thermal stability, this motif resists nuclease digestion. The motif has been identified not only in certain genomic contexts but also as a stabilizing element in engineered nucleic acids, where it enhances the performance of functional nucleic acid molecules. We hope that this review will accelerate further research and applications of mini&#8208;hairpin DNA.

         <title>Recent Advances in Chemical Probing Strategies for RNA Structure Determination in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review illustrates how structural probes combined with advanced sequencing technologies are revolutionizing our ability to map RNA structures and interactions within living cells. It highlights the development of innovative strategies tailored to probe RNA structures in particular biological contexts.








ABSTRACT
The intricate structures of RNA molecules facilitate their diverse cellular functions. These structures are shaped by the cellular environment, a context that in silico and in vitro methods typically cannot reconstitute, making it more difficult to study the structure of RNA in cells. In response to these challenges, RNA structure probing using cell&#8208;permeable chemicals has emerged as an effective method to capture the RNA structural landscape in its native environment. The integration of these probes with advanced adduct detection techniques, particularly second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation sequencing, has propelled the field forward, facilitating a deeper understanding of the RNA structurome within its precise functional context, including the examination of RNA structure at the single&#8208;molecule and single&#8208;cell levels, within specific subcellular compartments, and across various stages of RNA biogenesis and regulation. This Review summarizes the significant advances in the field of RNA structure probing, focusing on the development of novel structural probes, strategies for RNA structure reconstruction, innovative methodologies that offer extended applicability to address unique biological questions, and concludes with an outlook on future directions in the field.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Phenylation From [13C6] and [2H5]Benzene: A Versatile Tool for Stable Isotope Labeled MS Standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
We explored aryl thianthrenation as a tool for directly incorporating multiple isotopes into molecular scaffolds starting from full isotopically labeled benzene. Stable isotope&#8208;labeled (SIL) molecules are indispensable tools for investigating chemical and biological mechanisms and quantifying metabolites. However, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of isotopically labeled benzene remains challenging and under&#8208;investigated. This challenge stems from the direct functionalization of non&#8208;substituted benzene, which remains a difficult task. The approach described in this work is based on sulfonium salts used as a source of [13C6] and [2H5]benzene under palladium catalysis conditions. This approach demonstrates its efficiency in C&#9472;C and C&#9472;S bond formation with different substrates. Additionally, this methodology was employed for the synthesis of poly&#8208;substituted [13C6]benzene derivatives.

This concept review delves into the foundational principles, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of H&#8208;EDA complexes in radical chemistry, and forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the future research trajectories of this field.








ABSTRACT
Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes have emerged as powerful tools in radical chemistry, enabling diverse transformations under mild conditions. Among various EDA models, hydrogen&#8209;bonding EDA (H&#8208;EDA) complexes, which utilize hydrogen&#8209;bonding interactions to facilitate electron transfer between donors and acceptors, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Owing to their unique advantages, broad substrate compatibility, tunable selectivity, and environmental friendliness, H&#8209;EDA complexes represent promising candidates for advancing the fields of radical photochemistry and synthetic chemistry. This concept review delves into the foundational principles, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of H&#8208;EDA complexes in radical chemistry, and forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the future research trajectories of this field.

         <title>Self&#8208;Controlled Automated Strategy for the Synthesis of Gold Nanorods With Fine&#8208;Tuned Longitudinal Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an innovative strategy which allows to synthesize precisely tuned gold nanorods starting from nonpurified dispersions with variable aspect&#8208;ratio. The etching process is under direct control and can be stopped at any time by oxidizer quenching, providing stable dispersions.



ABSTRACT
Reproducibility is the main weak point of most of the currently available synthetic strategies for metal nanostructures, and this issue is hampering both production and research on such materials. While several synthetic strategies can be found in literature, most of them are fundamentally based on strict protocols consisting of lists of subsequential predefined operations to be executed in a time&#8208;defined manner. Such protocols are designed and optimized on the basis of pilot runs and are intrinsically affected by noncontrollable fluctuations in the experimental conditions. In this work an innovative, intrinsically flexible, automatized, and self&#8208;correcting strategy is proposed, which, in combination with real&#8208;time monitoring of the optical properties of the reaction mixture, allows to synthesize precisely tuned gold nanorods. This strategy is based on the fast and precisely controlled oxidation of precursor AuNRs. The fast reaction allows the selective and predictable etching of the nanorods by online&#8208;controlled subsequential additions of small amounts of oxidants, which are also able to remove undesirably shaped byproducts possibly present in the sample. Due to these features, this process can be automated and allows starting from nonpurified nanorod dispersions with variable aspect&#8208;ratio. Furthermore, the reaction can be stopped by oxidizer quenching, providing stable dispersions.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide&#8208;Mediated Chemical Processes in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 in water operates as a tunable electrophilic switch, inducing reversible pH and ion speciation changes that modulate nucleophilic reactivity and soft&#8208;matter structure, influencing material properties. This Perspective highlights how CO2&#8208;responsive aqueous systems and smart polymers enable controllable reactions, separations, and capture processes in water&#8208;based technologies.








ABSTRACT
The physical and chemical behavior of CO2 is key to understanding the ubiquity of inorganic carbon, which includes atmospheric CO2, dissolved CO2 in surface waters, and precipitated and mineralized carbonate in sediments and rock formations. These complex equilibria contribute to the global carbon cycle, inspiring novel CO2 applications. Because water is crucial in these equilibria, a comprehensive overview of CO2 reactivity in aqueous systems can help us to design and enhance the efficiencies of various artificial CO2&#8208;mediated processes. Here, we discuss the role of CO2 in responsive processes in, on, and with water, ranging from catalysis and organic synthesis to materials, surfactants, and carbon capture methods. These concepts are necessary for developing innovative smart materials, drug delivery systems, stimuli&#8208;controlled catalysis, novel environmental remediation processes, and new CO2 capture materials. We rationalize these recent examples in terms of mod of action of CO2 to recapitulate this rapidly developing field.

         <title>Crystal Engineering on Cu&#8208;Triazolate MOFs via Mixed&#8208;Linker Modulation for Selective Azeotropic Ethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modification of Cu&#8208;triazole metal&#8211;organic framework is demonstrated through a mixed&#8208;linker approach, providing a hydrophilic pore with open&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;sites. The framework is highly selective to water adsorption from an azeotropic mixture of water&#8211;ethanol. The enhanced framework's hydrophilicity and porosity are key to success in the improved performance for liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration.








ABSTRACT
A mixed&#8208;linker synthetic strategy was employed to engineer the morphology of copper&#8211;triazolate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;Tz MOFs) through controlled crystal growth. By incorporating amino&#8208; and thioether&#8208;functionalized triazole alongside the parent triazole linkers, the framework's hydrophilicity, pore cavity, and surface chemistry were systematically modulated. Upon thermal activation, the resulting mixed&#8208;linker MOFs revealed accessible Cu(II) open metal sites, together with enhanced hydrophilicity and porosity within the framework. These features synergistically contribute to superior water removal performance from azeotropic water&#8211;ethanol mixtures, outperforming the parent CuTz in separation efficiency.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Azobispyridine Radical&#8211;Boron Complexes and Their Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radical&#8211;boron complexes were synthesized via one&#8208;electron oxidation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;hydrazobispyridine precursors. The bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing B(C6F5)2 group effectively stabilized the radicals. ESR and DFT studies confirmed spin&#8208;delocalization over the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine &#960;&#8208;framework and N&#9472;N bond contraction upon oxidation. These radical complexes exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption.








ABSTRACT
Air&#8208;stable nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals are of great interest as building blocks for functional molecular materials. In this study, we developed 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radical&#8211;boron complexes that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption. The complexes were synthesized by introducing boron substituents into 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine frameworks, followed by one&#8208;electron oxidation to generate the corresponding radical species. The B(C6F5)2 derivatives were successfully isolated as air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable solids, whereas the BF2 and B(n&#8208;Bu)2 analogues could not be obtained. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy revealed broad isotropic signals with g &#8776; 2.00, indicating that the unpaired electron is delocalized over the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine core. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported this delocalization and reproduced the observed structural changes, including a N&#9472;N bond shortening upon oxidation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the methoxy&#8208;substituted complex confirmed these structural features. The radical complexes displayed NIR absorption with &#955;max values of 800&#8211;1140&#160;nm, depending on the substituents. These findings demonstrate that boron complexation effectively stabilizes 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radicals and enables precise tuning of their optical properties, providing a promising design principle for NIR functional dyes and radical&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A Tandem Chemical Vapor Deposition Platform for the Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Polypeptide Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free, two&#8208;step chemical vapor polymerization enables efficient, substrate&#8208;independent synthesis of surface&#8208;attached polypeptide films. Initiator deposition via CVD is followed by NCA ring&#8208;opening polymerization. Characterization confirms film formation and functionalization, allowing precise micropatterning and bioactive surface design for biomedical and industrial applications.








ABSTRACT
The precise engineering of surfaces decorated with polypeptides is critical for advanced diagnostics, biomedical coatings, and cellular interfaces. However, conventional methods are plagued by the need for solvents, multistep procedures, substrate limitations, and the abundance of side reactions. Here, we report that two&#8208;step chemical vapor polymerization can result in the fast, efficient, and substrate&#8208;independent synthesis of polypeptide films without the use of solvents or excipients. The first step involves deposition of an initiator layer, i.e., poly(4&#8208;amino&#8208;p&#8208;xylylene), via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of 4,16&#8208;diamino[2.2]paracyclophane. The second step involves evaporation and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxy anhydrides. This fully integrated CVD approach ensures substrate&#8208;independent, conformal growth of poly(propargyl&#8208;(S)&#8208;glycine) and poly(O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;(S)&#8208;tyrosine) films of up to 198&#160;nm thickness. The use of CVD processes eliminates the concern of side reactions, such as transfer and termination reactions, and is a prerequisite for the successful peptide micropatterning, demonstrated in this study. Successful peptide growth and post&#8208;polymerization modifications via click chemistry were confirmed by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry, x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The application of entirely solvent&#8208;free workflows to develop biomacromolecular coatings, such as the polypeptide films demonstrated in this study, addresses a critical gap in the pursuit of advanced and scalable biologization methods.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence of Molecular Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in upconversion lanthanide complexes varying from structural design to luminescent properties. They are classified into mononuclear lanthanide complexes, ion&#8208;paired lanthanide complexes and polynuclear lanthanide complexes, according to the structural characteristics.








ABSTRACT
Upconversion luminescence (UCL) materials based on the molecular lanthanide complexes have garnered increasing attention in diverse frontier fields in recent years. Compared with the intensively investigated lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), the development of UCL lanthanide complexes needs strengthening, especially considering the controllable synthesis and flexible architecture characteristics of lanthanide complexes. In this review, we overview the recent advances in UCL lanthanide complex, varying from structural design to luminescent properties. The challenges remaining and future prospects for UCL lanthanide complex are also discussed. We hope that the review will bring more inspirations and possibilities for developing the field of molecular UCL.

         <title>Synergistic Sm,Fe Co&#8208;Doping in NiO Nanoparticles on Carbon Nanofibers Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sm,Fe co&#8208;doped NiO nanoparticles anchored on interconnected carbon nanofibers (Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs) were developed to synergistically enhance OER activity and stability through Sm&#8208;induced electronic state engineering and oxygen vacancy engineering.








ABSTRACT
Nickel oxide (NiO) electrocatalysts suffer from inevitable oxidative degradation during alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where irreversible phase transitions compromise structural integrity and long&#8208;term stability. Herein, the Sm,Fe co&#8208;doped NiO nanoparticles anchored on interconnected carbon nanofibers (denoted as Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs) was proposed as highly efficient and stable OER catalyst. By employing rare earth (RE) Sm doping to stabilize low&#8208;valence Ni sites and generate oxygen vacancies (VO) through charge compensation, the Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs exhibits exceptional OER activity, with a low overpotential of only 274&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is superior to that of Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs (280&#160;mV) and RuO2 (333&#160;mV). Besides, Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs also has robust long&#8208;term stability and satisfying selectivity (nearly 100% Faradic efficiency). Using Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs as the anode in a water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer, it operates at a low potential of just 1.51&#160;V to achieve 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, making it a promising candidate for water splitting applications. It was discovered that Sm doping offers electron donation to Ni active sites in Fe&#8208;NiO to stabilize the Ni&#9472;O bonds, preventing over&#8208;oxidation and dissolution of metal species, and thus contributing to the significantly improved OER activity and long&#8208;term stability of the catalyst.

         <title>AgBF4&#8208;Induced Site&#8208;Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Sulfonylindoles in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization&#8208;Sulfonyl Migration Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective synthesis 4&#8208;suflonylindoles was achieved by a cyclization&#8208;rearrangement strategy by &#960;&#8208;Lewis acidic gold catalysts and the aid of silver cocatalyst. Particularly, the use of 3 equivalents of AgBF4 to SPhosAuCl is crucial for C4&#8208;selective migration of the sulfonyl group.








ABSTRACT
The reactions of ortho&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;N&#8208;arenesulfonylanilines in the presence of SPhosAuCl (2&#160;mol %) and AgBF4 (6&#160;mol %) produced the corresponding 4&#8208;sulfonylindoles in good yields with satisfactory site&#8208;selectivity at the C4&#8208;position of the indole ring. This reaction proceeded via cyclization followed by sequential [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of the sulfonyl group. The selective migration of the sulfonyl group to the C4&#8208;position was induced by using an excess amount of AgBF4 relative to the gold catalyst to form a dinuclear Au&#9472;Ag complex to decelerate the migration to C3&#8208;position. Furthermore, the tetrafluoroborate anion with its suitable gold affinity and hydrogen bonding characteristics, plays a crucial role in enabling selective migration to the C4&#8208;position.

         <title>Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembly of Perylene Imide&#8208;Containing Hydrophilic Polymers in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advances in the synthesis and design of perylene imide&#8208;functionalized hydrophilic polymers and their self&#8208;assembly in aqueous media. We highlight how molecular and supramolecular engineering drive the formation of functional, water&#8208;borne nanostructures, and identify the remaining challenges, which limit currently their broader application.








ABSTRACT
New advances in synthetic strategies have greatly expanded the structural diversity of perylene imides (PIs), increasing the tunability of their molecular properties and assemblies in organic solvents. More recent studies also show molecular assemblies in aqueous media when the hydrophobic perylene core is functionalized with hydrophilic groups, allowing their use not only in optoelectronics or catalysis, but also in biological applications. However, PIs are usually too hydrophobic to be used in water, and their molecular assemblies usually result in ill&#8208;defined nanostructures with a significant loss of their emissive properties. Therefore, a powerful and promising strategy to enhance PI solubility in water is to incorporate them into hydrophilic polymer chains. Compared to small hydrophilic groups, the length and architecture of the polymer can be controlled and adapted to modulate the nanostructure morphology while preserving the perylene's properties in water. This review summarizes the current literature on the self&#8208;assembly in water of PI&#8208;based hydrophilic polymers, with a focus on their synthesis and the different parameters that influence the self&#8208;assembly and properties of the materials.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Grafting of Cationic Polymer Brushes for Adsorption of Fluorinated Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a versatile approach to fabricate tunable charged interfaces by functionalizing stonewool fibers with a polydopamine (PDA)&#8211;quaternary amine coating via a grafting&#8208;to method. The modified surfaces exhibit rapid, concentration&#8208;dependent adsorption of anionic species driven by electrostatic interactions.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the adsorption behavior of charged molecular species at functionalized polymer interfaces is critical for advancing surface science and material design. Building upon recent advances in polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;mediated polymer grafting, we investigated electrostatic adsorption at cationic polymer brush surfaces. Using a grafting&#8208;to approach, we covalently attached poly(2&#8208;trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride) (PTMAEMA) to PDA&#8208;coated stonewool fibers and characterized the resulting charged interface via x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). We employed perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as a model anionic adsorbate to investigate binding at a quaternary amine&#8208;functionalized surface. Batch equilibrium sorption studies revealed concentration&#8208;dependent adsorption kinetics, achieving three times higher binding affinity for PTMAEMA&#8208;functionalized fibers at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, with equilibrium reached within 10 min. XPS analysis confirmed the successful surface functionalization with distinct nitrogen environments at 395.5&#160;eV (PDA) and 398.5&#160;eV (quaternary nitrogen), while thermogravimetric data indicated an organic loading of close to 28%. Our findings demonstrate that PDA&#8208;mediated polymer grafting provides a versatile platform for creating well&#8208;defined charged interfaces with tunable adsorption characteristics, and provides a methodology to explore fundamental adsorption phenomena at polymer&#8208;liquid interfaces.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Variable [7]Annulenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[7]Annulenyl radicals exhibit substituent&#8208;dependent conformations, affecting different spin distribution and chemo&#8208;stability. The dibenzo&#8208; analogues show more planar geometry and longer persistency than the tribenzo&#8208; variants due to more effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation.








ABSTRACT
A series of benzo&#8208;fused [7]annulenyl radical derivatives are synthesized and studied. By comparing their spin distribution differences revealed by EPR, variable molecular structures adaptive to steric features around the [7]annulenyl moiety are unveiled. Specifically, for radicals having no substituent on the vinylene carbons (C10 &amp; C11), a relatively planar dibenzo[a,d][7]annulenyl skeleton containing a delocalized spin is suggested by both experimental data and computation results. Depending on the substituting group on C5, decent to optimal persistency is observed, as represented by a half lifetime of 23&#160;h displayed by a triisopropylphenyl&#8208;substituted radical in air&#8208;saturated solution. When a substituent is added to C10, the radical stability can be further improved, although the [7]annulenyl framework becomes slightly bended. However, the tribenzo[a,c,e][7]annulenyl radicals exhibit noticeably inferior stability attributed to the nonplanar conformation assumed by the tetracyclic scaffold, which not only curbs the spin delocalization by disrupting the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, but also makes the molecule more susceptible to various spin&#8208;annihilation reactions. More interestingly, when an anthryl group is attached to C9 of tribenzo[a,c,e][7]annulenyl, a pronounced conformational transition to folded state is observed, with the spin concurrently relocated from the tribenzo[7]annulenyl moiety to 9,10&#8208;anthrylene unit, presumably driven by the superior spin delocalization property.

         <title>Study on the Directional Synthesis of Bi2S3 Induced by Graphene and the Mechanism of Pseudocapacitive Kinetics Regulation at the Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
To address the issues of capacity decay and poor rate performance of Bi2S3 anode materials, which are caused by their intrinsically low conductivity and significant volume expansion during cycling, this study adopts a redox self&#8208;assembly strategy. Under mild hydrothermal conditions, oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) induce the directed growth of Bi2S3 along the [001] crystallographic direction, successfully constructing a Bi2S3/GO composite anode with strong interfacial coupling. This structure effectively suppresses the agglomeration of Bi2S3 nanorods, forms a 3D conductive network, alleviates volume strain, and avoids structural damage caused by traditional high&#8208;temperature sulfidation processes. Electrochemical tests show that the 1.0&#8208;Bi2S3/GO composite retains a capacity of 300 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA&#183;g&#8722;1. At a high rate of 5000 mA&#183;g&#8722;1, it still exhibits a reversible capacity of 198.62 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, and after current recovery, the capacity rapidly increases to 439 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, with a capacity retention rate exceeding 70%. The lithium&#8208;ion diffusion coefficient reaches 8.7&#215;10&#8722;12 cm2&#183;s&#8722;1, which is 2.8 times higher than that of the pure phase. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the characteristic peak (&#964; = 0.3 s) in the distribution relaxation time (DRT) relaxation spectrum corresponds to the pseudocapacitive behavior on the GO surface, with a contribution rate of 58% at a scan rate of 2 mV&#183;s&#8722;1, significantly optimizing the ion storage dynamics at the interface. Additionally, the built&#8208;in electric field at the interface facilitates charge transfer, effectively shortening the relaxation time. The synergistic &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking buffering network further enhances structural stability and reaction reversibility. This study, through the &#8220;directed growth&#8208;pseudocapacitance regulation&#8208;relaxation matching&#8221; triple mechanism, provides new insights for the design of high&#8208;performance sulfide&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>SmI2/Sm&#8208;Induced Reductive Silacyclization of Alkene/Diene Derivatives Using Dichlorosilanes or 1,2&#8208;Dichlorodisilanes via Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SmI2/Sm&#8208;mediated silacyclization unlocks a concise route to 4&#8211;7&#8208;membered silacycles from simple unsaturated substrates and dichlorosilanes/disilanes. The complementary functions of samarium reductants trigger a reductive radical&#8211;polar crossover, offering a versatile strategy for constructing multiple Si&#9472;C bonds efficiently.








ABSTRACT
The development of efficient strategies for constructing cyclic organosilicon frameworks is considered of great importance because of their structural diversity and synthetic utility. Herein, we report a SmI2/Sm&#8208;mediated silacyclization of unsaturated organic compounds with readily available dichlorosilanes and &#8208;disilanes, enabling convenient access to 4&#8722;7&#8208;membered silacyclic compounds. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction involves silyl radical intermediates and proceeds via a reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) pathway. The present findings showcase the broad potential of Sm reagents in Si&#9472;C bond formation, providing a versatile strategy for constructing diverse silicon&#8208;containing frameworks.

         <title>Evolution of the Total Synthesis of Gregatin A and Related Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From deceptively simple monomers to architecturally complex dimers, this review traces the evolution of synthetic strategies to gregatin A and its dimeric congeners. Advances in asymmetric and biomimetic synthesis reveal how modern tactics unravel the structure, reactivity, and biosynthetic logic of this fungal polyketide family.








ABSTRACT
The gregatins constitute a distinctive family of fungal metabolites exhibiting notable phytotoxic and antimicrobial activities, which have attracted sustained interest from the synthetic community since their discovery. Despite their deceptively simple molecular architectures, the structural elucidation and asymmetric synthesis of gregatins have long remained challenging.

     alt="Evolution of the Total Synthesis of Gregatin A and Related Natural Products"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From deceptively simple monomers to architecturally complex dimers, this review traces the evolution of synthetic strategies to gregatin A and its dimeric congeners. Advances in asymmetric and biomimetic synthesis reveal how modern tactics unravel the structure, reactivity, and biosynthetic logic of this fungal polyketide family.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gregatins constitute a distinctive family of fungal metabolites exhibiting notable phytotoxic and antimicrobial activities, which have attracted sustained interest from the synthetic community since their discovery. Despite their deceptively simple molecular architectures, the structural elucidation and asymmetric synthesis of gregatins have long remained challenging. Among them, gregatin A serves as the prototypical member and a proposed biosynthetic precursor to several dimeric congeners, including penicilfuranone A, asperones A and B, and citrifurans A and D. Over the past decades, remarkable progress has been achieved in the total and asymmetric synthesis of these compounds, reflecting the continuous evolution of synthetic strategies toward greater efficiency, selectivity, and biomimetic relevance. This review summarizes the methodological innovations and strategic advances that have shaped the total synthesis of gregatin A and its structurally related dimers, highlighting the broader conceptual evolution of asymmetric synthesis in complex natural product chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit Recognition by a Calixarene&#8211;Pyrene Conjugate for Single&#8208; and Dual&#8208;Wavelength Fluorescence Sensing in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonatocalix[4]arene&#8211;pyrene conjugate functions as a fluorescence chemosensor for the optical detection of biorelevant analytes in water. Its photoinduced electron transfer (PET) response is triggered by an induced&#8208;fit recognition mechanism. Noncovalent assembly with an additional dye affords dual&#8208;color ratiometric signaling via competitive PET.








ABSTRACT
The discovery of fluorescence receptors that selectively bind small molecules with high affinity in aqueous media is critical for the development of new sensing and bioimaging assays. We herein report a new fluorescence receptor&#8208;dye chemosensor based on the monofunctionalization of p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4) receptor with pyrene (SC4&#8208;4Py). The SC4&#8208;4Py conjugate was found to retain the exceptional binding properties of SC4, allowing the high&#8208;affinity recognition of neurotransmitters, amino acids, and biogenic amines in aqueous solution and their optical detection. The SC4&#8208;4Py chemosensor operates through a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism triggered by conformational changes in the calixarene structure upon binding, allowing single&#8208;wavelength fluorescence detection of target analytes and its expansion into a dual&#8208;wavelength ratiometric indicator displacement assay (IDA) that relies on competitive PET between the pyrene and non&#8208;covalently bound lucigenin dye.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Dichlorosilyl Functionalized C4&#8208;Cumulene With Unique Bonding Scenario</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a silylene&#8208;functionalized C4&#8208;cumulene (2) and investigate its bonding scenario employing computational methods such as NBO analysis, AIM, and energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV). The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis showed that compound 2 prefers to possess electron&#8208;sharing covalent sigma and dative covalent sigma bonds (Si&#8596;C and C&#8594;Si) between Ph2C4 fragment in the anionic doublet state and silyl&#8208;amidine groups in cationic doublet state. This may be due to the electron&#8208;deficient nature of olefin and electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;donating functional groups on silicon atoms. Compound 2 displays unprecedented chemical bonding in this class of compounds as predicted by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations. We have also compared the bonding situation of compound 2 with a previously reported compound 3.








ABSTRACT
This work reports the preparation and computational investigation of a bis&#8208;dichlorosilyl functionalized C4&#8208;cumulene (2), which was synthesized by employing Amidinato&#8208;chlorosilylene, L(Cl)Si: (L = PhC(NtBu)2). Compound 2 was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. The stability, distribution of spin densities, and the nature of Si&#8208;C bonds of 2 were studied by employing natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, atoms in molecules (AIM), and energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV). The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis showed that compound 2 possesses electron&#8208;sharing covalent sigma and dative covalent sigma bonds (Si&#8596;C and C&#8594;Si) between the Ph2C4 fragment in the anionic doublet state and silyl&#8208;amidine groups in the cationic doublet state.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Synthesis of 3&#8208;Vinylphthalides via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Annulation: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;controlled enantiodivergent synthesis of 3&#8208;vinylphthalides has been achieved through the chiral cyclopentadienylrhodium(III) catalyzed C&#9472;H bond functionalization of arylcarboxylic acids and [4+1]&#8208;annulation reaction with cyclopropenes.








ABSTRACT
Asymmetric transition metal catalysis represents the most reliable method for the chiral induction in organic scaffolds and to synthesize a wide array of valuable 3D&#8208;molecules. However, accessing both enantiomers of the chiral molecules from a catalyst(s) having the same chirality through ingenious stereo&#8208;control has remained a highly demanding task. Herein, we disclose the catalytic enantiodivergent synthesis of 3&#8208;vinylphthalides from arylcarboxylic acids and cyclopropenes, an efficient surrogate for vinylcarbenes. Through engineering the chiral cyclopentadienylrhodium(III) catalysts, both enantiomers have been achieved with excellent yield and enantioselectivity via regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization using a weakly coordinating directing group and asymmetric [4+1]&#8208;annulation. Experimental and computational investigations revealed the mechanism of the oxidative annulation and enantiodetermining ring&#8208;opening isomerization of cyclopropenes, which is governed by the stereoselective cleavage of the C&#9472;C bond. The present study opens a new avenue in asymmetric C&#9472;H bond functionalization and allows access to both enantiomers of the target molecules without altering the chirality of the ligand.

         <title>Identification of Natural Isonitriles Through Ligation to an Azomethine Imine Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The azomethine imine (AMI)&#8211;isonitrile (NC) ligation allowed for the chemoselective detection of natural isonitriles in bacteria and fungi. The reactivity&#8208;based screening establishes a new stereogenic center, thereby allowing for facile distinction between chiral and achiral isonitriles. The work also unraveled a unique reactivity of isonitriles bearing an &#945;&#8208;COOH group.








ABSTRACT
Natural isonitriles are promising lead compounds for medicinal chemistry. Their identification is, however, challenging due to the hydrolytic lability of the isonitrile group. Here, we use the azomethine imine (AMI)&#8211;isonitrile ligation in a reactivity&#8208;based screening protocol for the chemoselective derivatization of natural isonitriles. The herein developed AMI probe rapidly reacts with isonitriles&#8212;primary, secondary, tertiary, as well as aromatic&#8212;to stable conjugates. A dibromide mass tag enables the detection of low&#8208;abundance isonitriles, even in complex biological matrices. The ligation establishes a new stereogenic center, thereby allowing facile distinction between achiral and chiral isonitriles by the formation of racemates or diastereoisomers, respectively. In addition, a unique reactivity of isonitriles bearing an &#945;&#8208;COOH group was unraveled. This AMI probe enabled the detection of known bacterially produced isonitriles and the identification of a novel fungal isonitrile.

The Mg&#9472;Mg&#8208;bonded compound [K(THF)3]2[LMg&#9472;MgL]2 (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(CH3)]22&#8722;) promotes reductive 4,4&#8242;&#8208;homocoupling of pyridines under ambient conditions and the coupled products can behave as H&#8208; (or D&#8208;) donors for hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds (C&#9552;C and C&#9552;N) in different types of substrates.








ABSTRACT
The Mg&#9472;Mg&#8208;bonded compound [K(THF)3]2[LMg&#9472;MgL]2 (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(CH3)]22&#8722;) can promote reductive 4,4&#8242;&#8208;homocoupling of pyridine and derivatives under ambient conditions, yielding the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinate products 2&#8211;6. Interestingly, these species can be viewed as &#8220;dimerized&#8221; metal&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridinates (bis&#8208;M&#8208;DHPs) and can transfer hydrogen or deuterium (as proton and hydride) to pyridines, imines and alkenes. This may provide a facile access to new H/D&#8208;donors, readily obtained from commercially available pyridines and a conveniently synthesized magnesium(I) complex, for controllable H&#8208;transfer (HT) to different types of unsaturated molecules. The coupling and HT mechanisms were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>[N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ Type Halogen Bonding: From Structure to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work comprehensively summarizes the synthetic strategies to overcome the instability of Br+ species, with a focus on introducing the emerging and powerful [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif and its application in halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). Current findings highlight the considerable potential of this motif to advance the development of controllable functional materials, thereby facilitating the design of stable Br+&#8208;bridged XOFs for use in catalysis, precision medicine, and related fields.








ABSTRACT
Noncovalent halogen bonding, particularly the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e&#8722;) [N&#8943;X&#8943;N]+ motif, represents a critical tool in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. While I+&#8208;based systems are well&#8208;studied, this review focuses on the emerging and highly functional [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif and its application in halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). The authors comprehensively summarize the synthetic strategies required to overcome the instability of the Br+ species, including halogen bond network spatial constraint, cation substitution, ligand exchange, and precise anionic regulation. Structural analysis reveals that the shorter N&#8943;Br bond length (2.07 &#197;) and stronger electron&#8208;deficient characteristics of the Br+&#8208;bridge provide unique functional advantages. This structural superiority translates to enhanced performance in applications such as selective alcohol oxidation and highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production, where XOFs(Br) materials consistently outperform their I&#8208;analogues and molecular precursors. Furthermore, it also highlights the potential of XOFs(Br) in biomedical fields, including superior antimicrobial activity and applications in photothermal therapy. This work confirms the significant potential of the [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif to drive future innovation in controllable functional materials, paving the way for the design of stable Br+&#8208;bridged XOFs for catalysis, precision medicine, and others.

         <title>Modulating Supramolecular Topology via Hydrogen Bonding in a Eumelanin Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective methylation of a eumelanin monomer tunes hydrogen interactions, transforming helical assemblies into zigzag motifs and modulating excitonic interactions. This work reveals hydrogen interactions as a key handle for directing supramolecular topology and optical behavior.








ABSTRACT
Eumelanin is a bio&#8208;pigment with remarkable photoprotective properties, whose function is tied to its complex supramolecular organization. Although hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are recognized as key forces in shaping its architecture, their individual contributions remain poorly defined. Among its molecular precursors, the canonical monomer 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole (DHI) is notable for forming extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks that stabilize supramolecular assemblies. To clarify how hydrogen bonding influences supramolecular topology in eumelanin precursors, we investigate selectively methylated derivatives of DHI, examining how subtle modifications to hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs alter crystal packing, intermolecular arrangements, and optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that O&#8208;methylation (DMI) changes hydrogen&#8208;bonding dimensionality yet preserves helical assemblies, whereas full O&#8208; and N&#8208;methylation (DMI&#8208;Me) suppresses hydrogen&#8208;bonding, giving rise to zigzag arrangements dominated by van der Waals forces. Solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state NMR measurements independently confirm the differences in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies. Complementary electronic spectroscopy shows that noncovalent architectures of the eumelanin derivatives exhibit pronounced excitonic coupling between neighboring chromophores. Electronic structure calculations support these observations, demonstrating that coupling originates primarily from Coulombic interactions, with minimal contributions from charge transfer. By linking molecular substitution to packing motifs and excitonic interactions, this work establishes hydrogen bonding as a design element for directing supramolecular order and emergent optoelectronic behavior in eumelanin&#8208;inspired materials.

We report the synthesis bis(arylethynyl)naphtho&#8208; and anthraquinones via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. The substrate scope of both quinones and linked bis&#8208;diynes was explored. Microwave irradiation remarkably enhanced yields.

ABSTRACT
Herein, we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of linked bis(diynes) Ar&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Ar with quinones for the rapid and efficient assembly of rigid structures containing bis(arylethynyl)naphthoquinones or anthraquinones using microwave radiation. The photophysical properties of the products were investigated, including absorption, emission, transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, and singlet oxygen luminescence studies. However, the quinones did not exhibit photoluminescence or detectable singlet oxygen luminescence. Computational analysis via density functional theory (DFT) was performed to elucidate the electronic and structural factors influencing their behavior. Moreover, reductive methylation of one of the bis(arylethynyl)naphthoquinones (3aa) generated the fluorescent bis(methoxy) naphthalene derivative 4aa (&#934;f = 0.53). However, 4aa underwent photooxidation in air under sunlight via reaction with 1O2, which it sensitized, leading to ring opening of the bis(methoxy)arene ring.

         <title>Synergistic Alloy and Support Effects in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Stabilized AuPd Catalysts for Aerobic 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuPd alloy nanoparticles were anchored on 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to integrate alloy&#8208;support synergistic effects. The catalyst Au67Pd33/TTATP achieved &gt;99% FDCA yield with the high metal utilization efficiency under mild conditions, owing to the synergy effect optimized reactant/product adsorption&#8208;desorption.








ABSTRACT
Catalytically converting 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) underpins renewable, bio &#8208;based plastics, yet designing metal&#8208;efficient catalysts remains challenging. Here, we combine alloy and support effects by anchoring AuPd alloy nanoparticles on 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Rationalizing alloy composition and COF functionality yielded Au67Pd33/TTATP, which converted HMF &#8594; FDCA in water using atmospheric O2 mild conditions, delivering &gt;99% FDCA yield, stable reusability, a turnover number (TON) of &#8764;100 at HMF/metal = 100, increasing to 518 at 600 (86.4% yield). High performance stems from alloy&#8208;support synergy that (i) partitions function (Au: HMF dehydrogenation; Pd: O2 activation) and (ii) matches adsorption&#8208;desorption (TTATP enriches HMF yet releases FDCA; alloy surfaces moderate HMF binding and avoid the strong FDCA adsorption of Pd alone), thereby enhancing metal atom efficiency.

         <title>Self&#8208;Calibrating Ratiometric DNA Aptamer Probe for Quantitative ATP Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the RFA&#8211;ECHO probe, an internally calibrated ATP sensor that remains responsive across millimolar ATP levels. Its self&#8208;correcting Cy5/ECHO ratio ensures accurate quantification independent of probe uptake. Compared with FRET&#8208;based sensors, it yields a robust ratiometric shift, distinguishing high&#8208;ATP cancer cells from normal ones, enabling reliable metabolic imaging and diagnostics.








ABSTRACT
Accurate monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8212;the universal energy currency of cells&#8212;is essential for elucidating cellular metabolism and disease progression. However, the high basal concentration of intracellular ATP (1&#8211;10&#160;mM) and variable probe uptake during imaging have hampered the development of reliable fluorescent sensors. Although DNA aptamer&#8208;based probes provide excellent selectivity, conventional turn&#8208;on designs often lack internal calibration, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based ratiometric probes typically exhibit limited signal changes. We report a ratiometric DNA duplex sensor comprising a Cy5&#8208;labeled ATP aptamer and a thiazole orange (TO)&#8208;labeled exciton&#8208;controlled hybridization&#8208;sensitive fluorescent oligonucleotide (ECHO) probe. Upon ATP binding, the aptamer structure switches and releases the reporter strand, resulting in a pronounced decrease in TO fluorescence while the Cy5 signal remains constant. Rational insertion of a polythymidine spacer effectively suppressed undesired TO&#8208;to&#8208;Cy5 energy transfer, enabling a reliable ratiometric Cy5/ECHO readout. The sensor operates robustly across physiological ATP concentrations, exhibits high nucleotide selectivity and satisfactory serum stability, and shows minimal cytotoxicity. Live&#8208;cell flow cytometry and confocal imaging further confirmed that cancer cells displayed significantly higher Cy5/ECHO ratios than normal fibroblasts. This internally self&#8208;calibrating aptamer sensor thus provides a powerful platform for intracellular ATP imaging and cancer diagnostics.

         <title>Coordination Complexes and Polymers of Novel Hybrid Tetrazole&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Pyrazole Ligands: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new triazole, pyrazole, and tetrazole&#8208;based ligands and their coordination complexes with FeII, CoII, NiII, CuII, and CdII were synthesized and fully characterized, including crystal structures. M&#246;ssbauer and SQUID studies confirmed the high&#8208;spin state of the FeII complex. Most metal complexes showed higher cytotoxicity than their free ligands in human cancer cell lines. CoII complexes 2 and 8 displayed the strongest anticancer activity with IC50 values in the micromolar range.








ABSTRACT
New series of triazole/pyrazole and tetrazole/triazole/pyrazole ligands were synthesized and coordinated with various transition metals to yield a diverse library of 14 complexes. All compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry, and a range of spectroscopic techniques (1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT&#8208;IR, and UV&#8211;visible diffuse reflectance). The crystal and molecular structures were elucidated via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their supramolecular features were explored through Hirshfeld surface analysis. The 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer and magnetic SQUID measurements confirmed the high&#8208;spin nature of the FeII complex 1. In the three human cancer cell lines, most metal complexes are somewhat more cytotoxic than the inactive ligands, with Co(II) complexes 2 and 8 being the most potent in two of the cell lines (with IC50 values in the two&#8208;digit micromolar range). Overall, this study highlights how blending tetrazole/triazole/pyrazole ligands with transition metals can lead to coordination compounds with potential in anticancer research, as a proof of concept. These results add valuable insight to the expanding field of metal&#8208;based therapeutics and could help guide the development of next&#8208;generation, more effective agents.

         <title>Exploiting the Intrinsic Peroxidase Activity of Unspecific Peroxygenase for the Oxidative Cyclization of Ortho&#8208;Substituted Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have emerged as powerful catalysts for diverse oxidation reactions. While previous studies have predominantly focused on their native mono(per)oxygenase activity, their full catalytic potential remains underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that the intrinsic peroxidative activity of UPOs can be effectively leveraged for the straightforward synthesis of benzoxazole compounds. Using the unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, a broad range of ortho&#8208;patterned phenolic substrates were efficiently converted into high&#8208;value benzoxazoles with conversions of up to 99% under the neat reaction conditions. The enzyme exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to the well&#8208;established horseradish peroxidase. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that phenoxyl radicals generated by UPO's intrinsic peroxidase activity are essential for benzoxazole formation. This work not only presents a mild and efficient synthetic route to benzoxazoles but also expands the known reactivity and oxidative chemistry of UPOs.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Remote Bisvinylogous Initiated Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Allyl Cycloalkenones With in situ Generated Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed, &#949;&#8208;regioselective, remote bisvinylogous initiated formal [4+2] cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones with ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) has been developed. In this transformation, &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones serve as dienophiles, while o&#8208;QMs act as diene precursors, enabling efficient access to naphthopyran derivatives with excellent selectivity under mild conditions.








ABSTRACT
In this work, we disclose that &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones can serve as effective bisvinylogous precursors through in situ generation of trienalcohol intermediates under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. This strategy enables a direct and highly diastereoselective &#948;,&#949;&#8208;regioselective remote bisvinylogous initiated formal [4+2] cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones with ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). In this process, &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones act as dienophiles while o&#8208;QMs function as diene precursors, providing efficient access to naphthopyran derivatives with excellent selectivity. Additionally, the asymmetric variant was also investigated using a BINOL&#8208;derived chiral Br&#248;nsted acid, thereby extending the utility of this method toward enantioselective synthesis.

This strategy enables a direct and highly diastereoselective &#948;,&#949;-regioselective remote bisvinylogous initiated formal [4+2] cycloaddition of &#946;-allyl cycloalkenones with &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone methides (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-QMs). In this process, &#946;-allyl cycloalkenones act as dienophiles while &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-QMs function as diene precursors, providing efficient access to naphthopyran derivatives with excellent selectivity. Additionally, the asymmetric variant was also investigated using a BINOL-derived chiral Br&#248;nsted acid, thereby extending the utility of this method toward enantioselective synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Potent Fluorogenic Ligands for Triplex DNA: 5&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;(Naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;Chromen&#8208;4&#8208;Ones</title>

5&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones are reported as a novel class of highly potent and selective triplex DNA ligands. These ligands induce triplex formation at submicromolar concentrations and inhibit enzymatic activity via ligand&#8208;mediated triplex formation. Binding to triplex DNA triggers an intense blue fluorescence emission in representative compound 3b, whereas no significant fluorescence emission occurs with duplex DNA.








ABSTRACT
We previously reported two series of 5&#8208;substituted flavonoids that selectively bind to triplex DNA while interacting minimally with duplex DNA. Our studies suggest that flavonoids are a promising scaffold for designing triplex ligands, owing to their mild synthesis conditions and ease of structural modification. In the present work, we introduce a novel class of highly potent triplex&#8208;specific ligands [5&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones], developed by expanding the aromatic surface of the flavone moiety. UV thermal denaturation studies indicate these compounds strongly stabilize triplex DNAs, enabling their direct dissociation into random coils without transitioning through a duplex intermediate. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis reveals that these ligands induce much greater conformational changes in triplex DNA compared to duplex DNA. Fluorescent intercalator (FID) displacement assays cross&#8208;verify the importance of pendant chains for triplex binding. Viscosity measurements suggest that these compounds bind to triplex DNA via intercalation. Notably, a representative compound (3b) emits strong blue fluorescence upon binding to triplex DNA, allowing direct visualization under UV illumination and providing a convenient method for probing triplex DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirms that 3b promotes triplex formation at submicromolar concentrations. Additionally, a plasmid&#8208;based assay developed in our lab demonstrates that 3b inhibits DraI endonuclease activity at low micromolar concentrations.

         <title>2&#8208;(Diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl Group Enabled Divergent Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Acetyl Phenylethanoid Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DPPA&#8208;directed strategy applied for the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl phenylethanoid glycosides (PGs) is described. The key DPPA group enables stereoselective glycosylation and selective late&#8208;stage deprotection, delivering PGs with retention of susceptible acetyl group.








ABSTRACT
Phenylethanoid glycosides (PGs), featuring a phenylethanoid glucoside core, exhibit diverse biological activities, notably neuroprotective effects. However, PGs bearing the susceptible 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group remain scarcely explored owing to their limited natural occurrence and the difficulty of preserving esters during synthesis. Herein, we describe the synthesis of such PGs, keeping the 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group intact via a remote DPPA&#8208;directed glycosylation strategy. The 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) group ensures high stereocontrol through hydrogen&#8208;bonding in glycosylation, and can be selectively removed under mild Mg(OMe)2&#8208;promoted conditions. This approach enables streamlined access to both acetylated and non&#8208;acetylated PGs, including cistanosides&#160;E, G, and H, as well as the proposed structure of lophanthoside A. The developed method provides a general platform for constructing PGs bearing acyl groups and supports further investigation of their bioactive mechanisms.

         <title>Enhanced Activity and Stability of Horseradish Peroxidase via Immobilization on Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks (H&#8208;COF (PS)) are prepared using Polystyrene Spheres (PS) template. Created macrospores provide space for enzyme while the micropores concentrate substrates. The porous skeleton protects the loaded enzyme from inactivation at high temperature and in organic solvents. The horseradish peroxidase loaded is efficient in dye decolorization and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol degradation.








ABSTRACT
In this work, hierarchical covalent organic frameworks (H&#8208;COF (PS)) were prepared via a hard template strategy using polystyrene spheres (PS) as the template. The H&#8208;COF (PS) exhibits high stability in aqueous solution without skeleton collapse. When used as a carrier for enzyme immobilization, the H&#8208;COF (PS) shows several outstanding advantages. The well&#8208;defined macropores and micropores are distributed throughout the COF. The created macrospores provide sufficient space for distribution of enzyme while the intrinsic micropores can concentrate substrates. The macropores and micropores in H&#8208;COF (PS) are adjacent, so the substrate can access to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with lower diffusion resistance than that in solution, resulting in enhanced enzymatic catalytic activity. The porous skeleton in H&#8208;COF (PS) can protect the embedded enzyme from inactivation caused by high temperature and organic solvents, ensuring HRP stability under strict reaction conditions. The prepared HRP immobilized H&#8208;COF (PS) (HRP@H&#8208;COF(PS)) demonstrates high efficiency in dye decolorization applications. This work provides a new platform to design enzyme&#8208;nanomaterials composites with both high activity and stability.

         <title>Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Chiral AIE&#8208;active Tetraphenylbutadiene Derivatives in Nematic Liquid Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale doping of chiral AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO, and TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) into the achiral nematic LC 5CB induces the formation of helical supramolecular architectures through host&#8208;guest interactions, yielding CPL&#8208;active composites that exhibit both a high dissymmetry factor (glum = +0.58) and an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 84.5%).








ABSTRACT
Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials featuring high luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum), high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL), and tunable emission properties are essential for practical applications. Herein, three chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB) derivatives (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) with high &#934;PL were synthesized, each bearing symmetric chiral bis&#8208;cholesteryl moieties and different electron&#8208;donating/accepting groups. When employed as chiral dopants, minute quantities of each derivative were individually doped into the achiral nematic liquid crystal (LC) 5CB, affording three series of luminescent chiral nematic LC composite systems (TPB&#8208;N*&#8208;LCs). These composites exhibit remarkable CPL activity with high glum values, attributed to host&#8208;guest interactions that facilitate co&#8208;assembly into ordered supramolecular helices and chiral amplification, despite the chiral AIE dopant itself lacking CPL emission. CPL signals and glum values enhance with increasing chiral dopant loading, peaking at +0.31, +0.42, and +0.58 for TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H/5CB, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO/5CB, and TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6/5CB, respectively, at 3 wt% doping. Notably, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating hexyloxy groups (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) or electron&#8208;accepting aldehyde groups (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO) modulates molecular packing, compatibility with 5CB host, and intermolecular interactions. Doping TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6 into 5CB achieves the optimal performance, with glum = +0.58 and &#934;PL = 84.5%. This work offers an effective strategy for developing CPL materials with simultaneously high glum and &#934;PL.

The functionalization of a dicopper(II, II) complex with a pyrene anchoring group allows to build functional electrodes for the toluene partial oxidation in different solvents.








ABSTRACT
A novel dicopper(II, II) complex (Cpyrene) was attached on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes resulting in a nanohybrid electrode (MWCNT@Cpyrene) able to partially oxidize toluene to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol with 300 and 409 TON h&#8722;1, respectively, in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene. Exchanging the solvent by acetonitrile leads to the additional N&#8208;benzylacetamide formation from the C&#8211;N coupling of toluene and in situ solvent oxidation with 313 TON h&#8722;1 at room temperature.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Methods for the Synthesis of All Three Bonds of the Alkyne's Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free methods for the synthesis of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond are reviewed. After analysis of several named reactions and discussion of improvements, recent advances in the synthesis of alkynes are discussed. Each section contains a proposed reaction mechanism and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches.








Abstract
Alkynes are among the most useful functional groups in synthetic chemistry, as they are excellent starting materials for various reactions and serve as valuable precursors during total synthesis. Despite the high number of transformations that utilize alkynes as substrates, few methods actually exist to synthesize them. Known methods involve several synthetic steps, harsh conditions, or cryogenic temperatures, which render them inconvenient and inefficient. This review of alkyne syntheses cover methods that enable the formation of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond in a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot fashion. This review offers a guide to gauge if current methods are potentially suitable to be scaled and used in industry and pharmaceutical processes.

         <title>Unveiling the Chemical Space of Astin&#8208;Type Peptides in Aster Tataricus, Cyanodermella Asteris, and Talaromyces Islandicus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plant Aster tataricus and its endophytic fungus Cyanodermella asteris are sources of a unique class of halogenated pentapeptides called astins. In addition, the fungus Talaromyces islandicus produces the astin&#8208;related class of pentapeptides, cyclochlorotines. Through molecular networking and mass spectrometry fragmentation data, we uncover a huge chemical diversity among the astin and cyclochlorotine pool of pentapeptides, which also reflects the genetic homology of both nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) systems and deepens our understanding of astin biosynthesis and enzymology.








ABSTRACT
The plant Aster tataricus L.f. is known as the main source of astin&#8208;type cyclopentapeptides. However, recent studies have shown that the endophytic fungus Cyanodermella asteris contains a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) ast encoding for astin core&#8208;structure biosynthesis and that it produces three astins, namely astins C, F, and G. The foodborne fungus Talaromyces islandicus produces the structurally highly related cyclochlorotine mycotoxins encoded by the BGC cct with significant genetic homology to ast from C. asteris. We thus became interested in exploring and comparing the astin&#8208;type peptide diversity found in these three source organisms to answer the long&#8208;standing question of the true metabolic origin of the astins. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based molecular networking and fragmentation trees revealed that A. tataricus, C. asteris, and T. islandicus indeed contain many more derivatives, hence uncovering a huge peptide chemodiversity resulting from promiscuous NRPS systems regarding amino acid selectivity. Both NRPS systems produce structurally related and even a number of identical compounds. Our findings reveal comprehensive metabolic insights strongly indicating that the endophyte C. asteris is the sole producer of the astin peptide family and, contrary to previous assumptions, metabolic cross&#8208;talk with the host plant is unlikely to have a major impact on astin structural diversity.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards Darobactin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need for new antibiotics led us to develop a new methodology for the synthesis of the natural product darobactin A selectively targeting gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the synthesis of strained indole&#8208;containing macrocycles. Key steps comprise a nucleophilic aromatic substitution&#8211;Bartoli indole synthesis&#8211;Negishi coupling alkylation sequence as well as a Larock indole macrolactamization.








ABSTRACT
We describe our efforts toward the total synthesis of darobactin A, an antibiotic that selectively targets Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The first route comprised the preparation of two separate advanced fragments. The unusual ether&#8208;linked tryptophan moiety was constructed utilizing a nucleophilic aromatic substitution&#8208;Bartoli indole synthesis&#8208;Negishi coupling sequence, while C&#8208;H arylation was used to prepare the &#946;&#8208;arylated lysine scaffold. Larock indole synthesis was confirmed as a valuable approach to achieve the first macrocyclization. An approach using macrolactamization for the construction of the second, western macrocycle proved to be unsuitable for the darobactin A scaffold. Thus, a second strategy focused on the synthesis of both macrocycles through two distinct intramolecular Larock indole syntheses that further brought valuable insights into the atroposelectivity of such reactions. Herein, we report our study toward the total synthesis of darobactin A, including the synthesis of advanced intermediates.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthesis of the dinucleotide 4 for a projected future total synthesis of the m7G cap 1. Highlights of the route include: 1) a 3&#697;&#8208;H&#8208;phosphonate/5&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate Michaelis&#8208;Arbuzov coupling to forge the 3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;phosphoroselenolate; 2) an Amosova reductive selenomethylation to install the 2&#697;&#8208;SeMe; 3) a solid CPR II 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphitylation; and 4) an aq. tBuO2H 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphite oxidation without accompanying selenoxide formation. Also, MeCN has been found to be especially beneficial for the SN2 reactions of 10 and the iodide 12.








ABSTRACT
In this paper, a solution&#8208;phase total synthesis is described of the 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#697;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#697;&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;adenosine 3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;phosphoroselenolate guanosine dinucleotide (4) using a rt, 2,6&#8208;lutidine&#8208;mediated, nucleoside 3&#697;&#8208;H&#8208;phosphonate/5&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate Michaelis&#8208;Arbuzov ligative coupling, whose potential mechanism is discussed herein. Our route to 4 is predicated upon the highly efficient new 2&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;triflate selenocyanate anion displacement of 10 in MeCN, to obtain the 2&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate 9, which was allied with an Amosova NaBH4/MeI mediated reductive selenomethylation in MeOH. A novel solid CPR II&#8208;mediated 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphitylation of the dinucleotide alcohol 6 and a 70% aqueous t&#8208;BuO2H oxidation successfully installed the 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphate moiety within 4 without oxidizing the 2&#697;&#8208;selenomethyl group. It is envisaged that 4 will be of value for a future total synthesis of the m7G cap 1; a molecule of potential utility for therapeutic mRNA manufacture.

&lt;p&gt;Here we report a synthesis of the dinucleotide &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; for a projected future total synthesis of the m7G cap &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Highlights of the route include: 1) a 3&#697;-H-phosphonate/5&#697;-selenocyanate Michaelis-Arbuzov coupling to forge the 3&#697;,5&#697;-phosphoroselenolate; 2) an Amosova reductive selenomethylation to install the 2&#697;-SeMe; 3) a solid CPR II 5&#697;-O-phosphitylation; and 4) an aq. &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H 5&#697;-O-phosphite oxidation without accompanying selenoxide formation. Also, MeCN has been found to be especially beneficial for the S&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;2 reactions of &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; and the iodide &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a solution-phase total synthesis is described of the 5&#697;-O-phosphorylated 2&#697;-deoxy-2&#697;-selenomethyl-adenosine 3&#697;,5&#697;-phosphoroselenolate guanosine dinucleotide (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) using a rt, 2,6-lutidine-mediated, nucleoside 3&#697;-H-phosphonate/5&#697;-selenocyanate Michaelis-Arbuzov ligative coupling, whose potential mechanism is discussed herein. Our route to &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is predicated upon the highly efficient new 2&#697;-O-triflate selenocyanate anion displacement of &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; in MeCN, to obtain the 2&#697;-selenocyanate &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, which was allied with an Amosova NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/MeI mediated reductive selenomethylation in MeOH. A novel solid CPR II-mediated 5&#697;-O-phosphitylation of the dinucleotide alcohol &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and a 70% aqueous &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H oxidation successfully installed the 5&#697;-O-phosphate moiety within &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; without oxidizing the 2&#697;-selenomethyl group. It is envisaged that &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; will be of value for a future total synthesis of the m7G cap &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; a molecule of potential utility for therapeutic mRNA manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boric Acid Promoted Base&#8208;Free Chan&#8208;Lam Amination Reaction: A Computationally Inspired Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico studies are carried out to underpin the mechanistic features in B(OH)3 promoted CL amination under base&#8208;free condition. Mechanistic effect on organoborane:amine stoichiometry inversion exemplified with transmetalation as rate&#8208;determining.








ABSTRACT
CuII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions based on Chan&#8208;Lam (CL) protocol have established themselves as one of most reliable and practical synthetic tools for the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;nitrogen/heteroatom bonds. Since decades this methodology has witnessed considerable development in its application scope, industrial uptake and fundamental mechanistic knowledge. Despite its successful application and popularity, the underlying mechanistic understanding remains underdeveloped and unexplored. Current theoretical investigation underpins the mechanism of CL&#8208;based amination reaction under base&#8208;free conditions employing the transmetalation by&#8208;product B(OH)3 as promoter. The rate&#8208;determining transmetalation involves an energy span of 26.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 with subsequent overall disproportionation and reductive elimination barrier of 25.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, accompanying stable intermediates in comparison to the base&#8208;mediated CL amination. The aryl migration involves a unique six&#8208;membered transition state unlike similar transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transmetalation event. The CuI&#8594;CuII oxidative regeneration is facile in the presence of B(OH)3 coordinated intermediates. The calculated results are in line with experimental kinetic studies and for the first time elucidates the mechanistic effect of inverting the organoboron: amine stoichiometry. Furthermore, Hammett studies involving substituted aryl boronic acid substrates reveals electron&#8208;rich substitution to entail lower transmetalation barrier. Overall, the boric acid stabilized copper intermediates are thermodynamically stable, allowing the amination to occur at improved time frame.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the First Generation of Glycosylated Nucleoside Analogues as Potential Inhibitors of the Base J Metabolism in Kinetoplastid Parasites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel analogues of the kinetoplastid&#8208;specific DNA base J unlock a new way to target parasite epigenetic regulation. Some compounds selectively inhibit Leishmania and Trypanosoma species without harming human cells, revealing a promising route toward innovative antiparasitic therapies.








ABSTRACT
Leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis are severe parasitic infections with significant impacts on veterinary and public health, particularly affecting the poorest populations. The therapeutic arsenal against these neglected tropical diseases is limited, and the emergence of resistance to available medicines complicates treatment. These kinetoplastid parasites share a unique DNA modification, that is &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (base J), which appears to play an essential role in parasite development and survival through an original epigenetic mechanism, allowing adaptation to environmental changes. To date, the regulatory pathway of this unique nucleobase has not been explored as a potential therapeutic target. In this work, we report the synthesis of several families of base J analogues and assess their potential against different kinetoplastid species. Some compounds have shown antiparasitic activity and no toxicity toward human primary fibroblasts, revealing promising new strategies for antiparasitic therapy.

         <title>Alkene Functionalizations via the Alkenyl Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the functionalization of nonaromatic systems via Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (namely, the alkenyl Catellani reaction). The nonaromatic substrates include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkenes, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes. In addition, this review outlines developments in asymmetric alkenyl Catellani reactions and highlights their use in the total synthesis of structurally complex molecules.








ABSTRACT
Palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is widely regarded as an effective strategy for constructing polysubstituted arenes, providing a rapid and efficient route that is often difficult to accomplish using traditional cross&#8208;coupling methods. This review focuses on applying Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis to the functionalization of nonaromatic systems, referred to as the alkenyl Catellani reaction. The nonaromatic substrates discussed include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkene, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes. In addition, this review outlines developments in asymmetric alkenyl Catellani reactions and highlights their use in the total synthesis of structurally complex molecules.

         <title>Hydrogels Formed by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Collagen&#8208;Mimetic Peptides With a Constrained Backbone Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinked collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (kinkCMPs), whose backbone is constrained by a disulfide bond, are designed to induce hydrogel formation. The kinked backbone promotes supramolecular assembly into tunable hydrogels with thermal stability depending on length. The resulting gels are also applicable as cell culture scaffolds, providing a new strategy for peptide&#8208;based biomaterials.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;assembling peptides have attracted increasing attention as building blocks for developing functional materials. Among them, collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (CMPs) represent a class of self&#8208;assembling systems. However, although short&#8208;chain CMPs spontaneously fold into thermodynamically stable triple&#8208;helical trimers, they fail to further undergo supramolecular assembly to form hydrogels. We report a new strategy for supramolecular hydrogel formation based on CMPs. The designed peptide, termed kinkCMP, features a kinked backbone introduced at the center of the sequence via adjacent disulfide bonds. The kinkCMP forms a gel, and its gel denaturation temperature can be tuned by varying the peptide chain length. Moreover, the hydrogel can be used as a cell culture scaffold. These results provide a versatile approach for constructing supramolecular hydrogels based on CMPs, expanding the design strategies for peptide&#8208;based functional materials.

2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzopyrans were synthesized highly diastereoselectively from phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides via Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed tandem Michael addition and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. The diastereoselectivity is controlled thermodynamically, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study provides a new synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.

Scandium triflate&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of electron&#8208;rich phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides is realized. This protocol enables the highly diastereoselective construction of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzopyrans (chromanes) via a domino Michael addition (Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation) and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. Using 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides as Michael acceptors, electron&#8208;rich phenols can be extended to methylphenols. The diastereoselectivity is mainly decided by the stability of diastereomeric products, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study expands the synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.

         <title>Metalloporphyrin Monolayers as Tunable Platforms for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline monolayers of Fe and Cu porphyrins on graphite enable nanometer&#8208;precision mapping of active sites for CO2 electroreduction. High&#8208;resolution STM reveals &#8764;1.5 nm periodicity and quantitative active site distribution. Faradaic efficiencies scale with surface composition, with Fe outperforming Cu, establishing direct structure&#8211;activity correlations at the molecular level.








ABSTRACT
While molecular electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction has advanced significantly, a key challenge persists in accurately defining the active site distribution, surface density, and structural organization of heterogenized catalysts at electrode interfaces. In this study, we address this gap by employing self&#8208;assembled monolayers of physisorbed metal porphyrins (Fe and Cu) on graphite electrodes as structurally well&#8208;defined model systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). High&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed crystalline monolayers with uniform active site distribution, offering periodicities of &#8764;1.5 nm. These monolayers exhibit moderate Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for CO production, with Fe porphyrin outperforming its Cu analogue. Isotopic labeling experiments were employed to confirm that the product CO originates from added CO2. Bicomponent monolayers comprising Fe porphyrin and catalytically inactive free&#8208;base porphyrin were fabricated to investigate composition&#8211;activity relationships. STM imaging enabled direct, quantitative assessment of surface composition, and subsequent CO2RR measurements revealed a systematic decrease in FE with increasing coverage of the catalytically inactive component. These findings demonstrate the utility of molecularly ordered porphyrin monolayers as a powerful platform for probing structure&#8211;activity relationships in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with exceptional spatial and compositional precision.

         <title>Synthesis of Peptides, Peptide Nucleic Acid Components, and other Biogenic Compounds from a Three&#8208;Component Prebiotic Mixture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy proton irradiation of a formamide&#8211;diaminomaleonitrile&#8211;glycine system in the presence of meteorites produces a broad spectrum of biogenic compounds, including nucleobases, nucleosides, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;peptide conjugates, highlighting a chemically plausible prebiotic network.








ABSTRACT
We have explored the reactions of a three&#8208;components mixture made of formamide, diaminomaleonitrile, and glycine, with meteorites as catalysts and high&#8208;energy proton beam irradiation as the energy source, mimicking the solar wind. The resulting mixture contained a wide array of biogenic compounds, including the complete set of RNA nucleobases and nucleosides, thymine and its analogs, pterins, triazines, carboxylic acids, diketopiperazines, hydantoins, N&#8208;carboxyamino acid anhydrides, amino acids, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;amino acid/peptide conjugates. It also embodies the possibility of synthesis stability of RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras onto which evolution to the extant molecular genetic system could start. The prebiotic worth of the system consists of the fact that formamide derives from HCN hydrolysis; glycine is a condensation product of formamide and HCN; diaminomaleonitrile is obtained from HCN. The fact that the starting mixture is three&#8208;component does not decrease the prebiotic value; it is a subset of a largely possible general universal condition: all the starting components are only the second step of facile condensation reactions. This model could be the starting point for the chemical evolution towards biological complexity.

         <title>Fluorescence Properties and Mg2+ Selectivity of Aryl&#8208;Alkynyl Derivatives of the o&#8208;Aminophenoltriacetate (APTRA) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a challenge to improve the selectivity of high&#8208;denticity ligands for Mg2+ over Ca2+. We show that in aryl&#8208;alkynyl derivatives of APTRA, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents lower the binding affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, making the ligand more selective for Mg2+. The effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen is para to alkyne, but the associated charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence is weak in water.








ABSTRACT
Ortho&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;N,N,O&#8208;triacetate (APTRA) has been widely adopted for binding and sensing Mg2+, although it binds Ca2+ more strongly. This contribution investigates APTRA derivatives that incorporate an aryl&#8208;alkynyl fluorophore, addressing how the binding affinities for Mg2+ and Ca2+ are modulated by a substituent R in the aryl ring of the fluorophore. Six such derivatives have been synthesized via their tris&#8208;ethyl esters. They feature X &#9552; CN, CF3, or OMe, as a mesomerically electron&#8208;withdrawing, inductively electron&#8208;withdrawing, or electron&#8208;donating substituent, respectively, with the alkyne either para or meta to the APTRA nitrogen. Study of the absorption and fluorescence properties of the esters reveals the importance of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states for X &#9552; CN and CF3, but not OMe. The corresponding carboxylate ligands are less emissive in water, and the fluorescence is not strongly modulated by metal ions. However, the absorption spectra change markedly, allowing dissociation constants Kd to be evaluated. The key conclusions are that (i) electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents attenuate the affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, leading to a net improvement in selectivity for Mg2+, and (ii) the effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen (as opposed to phenolic oxygen) is para to&#8212;and hence directly conjugated with&#8212;the alkyne.

Inducible protein expression is a cornerstone of many aspects of industrial and molecular biotechnological processes. 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isopropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranose (2&#8242;F&#8208;IPTG) and 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isobutyl&#8208;C&#8208;galactoside (2&#8242;F&#8208;IBCG) mimics were explored for protein expression studies.

ABSTRACT
Inducible protein expression is a cornerstone of many aspects of industrial and molecular biotechnological processes. However, limited availability of inducible transcription factors can reduce our ability to control expression at a population level. The design and synthesis of a powerful inducer containing a fucose is demonstrated to induce protein expression through the lac operon only in cells with the ability to selectively de&#8208;fucosylate them. Batch and automated continuous&#8208;flow processes are reported for the syntheses of both 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isopropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranose (2&#8242;F&#8208;IPTG) and isobutyl&#8208;C&#8208;galactoside (2&#8242;F&#8208;IBCG) mimics. Fucosylation of the inducer allowed for fucosidase&#8208;dependent expression of a reporter protein, providing an additional layer of control over inducible gene expression.

         <title>Programmable Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>

The charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles, termed PER&#8208;TCQ, was constructed through charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the electron donor (PER) and the electron acceptor (TCQ), which exhibits efficient NIR absorption. Consequently, PER&#8208;TCQ achieves effective tumor ablation via photothermal therapy.








ABSTRACT
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising tumor treatment strategy. However, developing organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with both high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and simple synthesis remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed the charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles (termed PER&#8208;TCQ), via supramolecular assembly of perylene (PER) as the electron donor and tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCQ) as the electron acceptor. The strong charge&#8208;transfer interaction between PER and TCQ confers PER&#8208;TCQ nanoparticles with pronounced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, PER&#8208;TCQ achieved a high PCE of 66.1%. Its effective antitumor efficacy was consistently validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating the great promise of such programmable complexes as high&#8208;performance organic PTAs.

&lt;p&gt;The charge-transfer complex nanoparticles, termed PER-TCQ, was constructed through charge-transfer interaction between the electron donor (PER) and the electron acceptor (TCQ), which exhibits efficient NIR absorption. Consequently, PER-TCQ achieves effective tumor ablation via photothermal therapy.
