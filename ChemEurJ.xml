         <title>Effect of Arylmethylene Substitutions on Molecular Structure, Optoelectronic Properties and Photovoltaic Performance of Dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors</title>

Arylmethylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains: Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains have been developed to systemically investigate the impact of arylmethylene substitution and its number on molecular structure, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Better light&#8208;harvesting properties and molecular planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMO levels are achieved, enabling improvements in device efficiency both for halogenated and non&#8208;halogenated processing solvents.







Abstract
Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) were developed that feature methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains, to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA without conjugated side chains. The synthesized SMAs were tested in polymer solar cells for examples of their applicability. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.

         <title>Elastic organic crystals based on barbituric derivative: multifaceted bending and flexible optical waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multifaceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative  DBDT  , which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH  3  OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (  H  ) and elastic modulus (  E  ) were 0.28 &#177; 0.01 GPa and 4.56 &#177; 0.03 GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O) and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627 nm were 0.7 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 0.9 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 1.8 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state) at 567 nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>High Fidelity Enzyme&#8208;Free Primer Extension with an Ethynylpyridone Thymidine Analog</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High fidelity base pairing is important for the transmission of genetic information. Weak base pairs can lower fidelity, complicating sequencing, amplification and replication of DNA.&#160; Thymidine 5'&#8208;monophosphate (TMP) is the most weakly pairing nucleotide among the canonical deoxynucleotides, causing high errors rates in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. &#160;Here we report the synthesis of an ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside analog of 3'&#8208;amino&#8208;2',3'&#8208;dideoxythymidine monophosphate and its incorporation in a growing strand by enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. The ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleotide accelerates extension more than five&#8208;fold, reduces misincorporation and readily displaces TMP in competition experiments. The results bode well for the use of the  C  &#8208;nucleoside as replacements for thymidine in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterated Indocyanine Green (ICG) with Extended Aqueous Storage Shelf&#8208;Life: Chemical and Clinical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuterium atom in the right place mitigates the 60&#8208;year problem of aqueous Indocyanine Green (ICG) instability. A clinical stock solution of heavy ICG in water can be stored for an extended period without significant loss of fluorescence brightness; this will improve the effectiveness of various biomedical imaging, diagnostic and therapy procedures.







Abstract
Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dye that is used extensively for various imaging and diagnostic procedures. One drawback with ICG is its instability in water, which means that reconstituted clinical doses have to be used very shortly after preparation. Two deuterated versions of ICG were prepared with deuterium atoms on the heptamethine chain, and the spectral, physiochemical, and photostability properties were quantified. A notable mechanistic finding is that self&#8208;aggregation of ICG in water strongly favors dye degradation by a photochemical oxidative dimerization reaction that gives a nonfluorescent product. Storage stability studies showed that replacement of C&#8722;H with C&#8722;D decreased the dimerization rate constant by a factor of 3.1, and it is likely that many medical and preclinical procedures will benefit from the longer shelf&#8208;lives of these two deuterated ICG dyes. The discovery that ICG self&#8208;aggregation promotes photoinduced electron transfer can be exploited as a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation photodynamic therapies.

         <title>An Optimized Protocol for the Synthesis of Peptides Containing trans&#8208;Cyclooctene and Bicyclononyne Dienophiles as Useful Multifunctional Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13632-13641, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple methodology for the introduction of two strained dienophiles, bicyclononyne (BCN) and trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), into synthetic peptides is presented. The method is based on the post&#8208;synthetic attachment of the clickable groups to lysine residues after selective deprotection steps. The resulting peptides can be used for construction of useful peptide conjugates in highly efficient and biocompatible manner via two orthogonal click reactions, the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (iEDDA).







Abstract
Despite the great advances in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here, we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles, trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click&#8208;functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull&#8208;down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the great advances in solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here, we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post-synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide-peptide and peptide-drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click-functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull-down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Preparation of CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries**

Moving one step further beyond lithium? A nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 material has been synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Its excellent rate performance, outstanding cycling stability and pseudocapacitive energy storage properties give it promise for use as an efficient cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered a promising energy&#8208;storage device due to their high energy density and high safety, but they still suffer from a lack of high&#8208;rate performance and cycle performance of the cathode. Nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites have been synthesized for the first time by a facile solvothermal method. Herein, the magnesium ion storage behavior when applied in the cathode for RMBs is discussed. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 256&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and an outstanding long&#8208;term cyclic stability over 300&#8197;cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the electrochemical storage mechanism demonstrated that the storage process of magnesium ion in the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 cathode is mainly driven by strong pseudocapacitive effects.

A catalytic domino reduction / imine formation / intramolecular cyclization / oxidation allows the synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles. The reported process employs an inexpensive and nontoxic dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex as catalyst, easily available nitroarenes as starting materials and different glycols as reducing agents with reuse of the waste reduction carbonyl byproduct, which is embodied into the final compounds.







Abstract
A catalytic domino reduction&#8211;imine formation&#8211;intramolecular cyclization&#8211;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.

Improving your memory: Combining the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer pore of pillar[5]arene with the nanometer pore structure of two&#8208;dimensional polymers provides a multichannel for Ag+ migration so that a ternary&#8208;state memristor based on the conductive filament mechanism could be designed. The obtained Ag/2DPTPAZ+TAPB/ITO devices show excellent ternary memory performance, including low threshold voltage, steady retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio, considerable ternary yield, and good thermal stability and flexibility.







Abstract
Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.&#8201;e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired so as to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report the first multichannel strategy to realize a ternary&#8208;state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of a two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with multilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2=1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;103), and high ternary yield (75&#8201;%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DPTPAZ+TAPB can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after being bent 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a temperature as high as 300&#8201;&#176;C. It is envisioned that the results of this work will open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption, and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13544-13551, September 24, 2021. </description>

The diastereoselectivity of the peptide coupling between aminoacidylnucleotides and amino acid esters in aqueous condensation buffer was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Homochiral dipeptides were found as the preferred products.







Abstract
Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in&#8197;situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5&#8242;&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios&#8804;62&#8201;:&#8201;38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.

When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5&#8242;-aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P- or &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Ser-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Trp, phosphoramidate-linked to adenosine 5&#8242;-monophosphate with its &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-ribose ring. When control reactions with an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios&#8804;62&#8201;:&#8201;38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of trivalent lanthanide heteroleptic sandwich complexes with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) and cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligands shows a significant bending of the Cnt ligand when the size of the ion decreases, implying a size&#8208;controlled hapticity switch.







Abstract
Sandwich complexes of lanthanides have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as Single Molecule Magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln=Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by 1H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13591-13604, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are capable to generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation with green light only, when bound to polynucleotides by intercalation, whereas they slowly decompose when irradiated in water showing poor sensitization activity. Enhanced sensitization activity is observed upon interaction with AT but not GC base pairs. This makes them interesting for applications, where singlet oxygen has to be generated with local control.







Abstract
There is an ongoing interest in 1O2 sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes 2&#8201;o&#8211;p and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for 1O2. In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA 1O2 is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of 2&#8201;o&#8211;p with DNA were investigated by thermal DNA melting studies, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and linear and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer 2&#8201;o in poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of 1O2 was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of 1O2 quenchers. When bound to poly(dG&#8201;:&#8201;dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers 2&#8201;o and 2&#8201;m, namely the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical 1O2 generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.

Upon reaction of Fe(OAc)2, NHC, and EtMgBr, it was found that the NHC utilized determined the rate of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Fe(0)&#8208;ethylene and Fe(II)&#8208;ethyl species were isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, and MCD spectroscopy. The Fe(0)&#8208;ethylene complexes were found to have a rare S=1 ground state. The Fe(II)&#8208;ethyl species were found to form cross&#8208;coupled product under stoichiometric reaction conditions.







Abstract
The high abundance, low toxicity and rich redox chemistry of iron has resulted in a surge of iron&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations over the last two decades. Within this area, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been widely utilized to achieve high yields across reactions including cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8722;H alkylation, amongst others. Central to the development of iron&#8208;NHC catalytic methods is the understanding of iron speciation and the propensity of these species to undergo reduction events, as low&#8208;valent iron species can be advantageous or undesirable from one system to the next. This study highlights the importance of the identity of the NHC on iron speciation upon reaction with EtMgBr, where reactions with SIMes and IMes NHCs were shown to undergo &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination more readily than those with SIPr and IPr NHCs. This insight is vital to developing new iron&#8208;NHC catalyzed transformations as understanding how to control this reduction by simply changing the NHC is central to improving the reactivity in iron&#8208;NHC catalysis.

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study of Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13642-13650, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin cycle: The IR spectra of molecular platinum fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. PtF4 is formed almost quantitatively under blue light radiation of PtF6, while PtF5 and PtF3 were produced by subsequent UV radiation of PtF4. The coexistence of a singlet and a triplet electronic spin state of PtF4 caused by competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrix.







Abstract
Molecular platinum fluorides PtFn, n=1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF6 embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser&#8208;ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices under cryogenic conditions provide, for the first time, experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF3, PtF4 and PtF5. Photolysis of PtF6 enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF4, whereas both PtF5 and PtF3 were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF4. The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help of one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computation to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF4, for which a spin&#8208;triplet (3B2g, D2h) coexists with an electronic singlet state (1A1g, D4h) in solid neon matrices.

The coexistence of a singlet and a triplet electronic spin state of PtF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; caused by competing Jahn-Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low-temperature matrix.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular platinum fluorides PtF&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, photo-initiated fluorine elimination from PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; embedded in solid noble-gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser-ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare-gas matrices under cryogenic conditions provide, for the first time, experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, PtF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and PtF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Photolysis of PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas both PtF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and PtF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help of one- and two-component quasirelativistic DFT computation to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn-Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, for which a spin-triplet (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;) coexists with an electronic singlet state (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>A 70&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Mystery in Technetium Chemistry Explained by the New Technetium Polyoxometalate&#160;[H7O3]4[Tc20O68]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O</title>

The red product obtained upon concentration of an HTcO4 solution contains the [Tc20O68]4&#8722; polyanion, which is the first technetium polyanionic species reported. The [Tc20O68]4&#8722; species exhibits a molecular structure never observed before and consists of a square&#8208;planar Tc4O4 ring decorated by sixteen Tc(VII)O4 units. The red color is due to d&#8594;d electronic transitions between the Tc(V) atoms of the central ring.







Abstract
[H7O3]4[Tc20O68]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O [1] was prepared from an aqueous Tc2O7 solution concentrated over anhydrous H2SO4. [Tc20O68]4&#8722; is the first polyanionic species to be reported for Tc. The unit cell contains one centrosymmetric [Tc20O68]4&#8722; polyanion as well as hydronium ions and water molecules. The core of the structure consists of four Tc(V)O6 octahedra that form a square Tc4O4 ring. The four Tc(V)O6 octahedra are decorated by sixteen Tc(VII)O4 tetrahedra. Calculations show the bonding within the Tc4O4 ring to consist of a 3&#8208;center bond formed between each neighboring pair of Tc atoms and their bridging oxygen. Calculations also indicate that a strong d&#8594;d electronic transition at 513&#8197;nm is the origin of the red color of [1]. The characterization of red HTcO4 solutions by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has complemented the description of this compound in aqueous solution. The formation mechanisms in solution, including the possible role of technetium's radioactivity in the formation of [1], are discussed.

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali&#8208;Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI=Li&#8722;Cs)</title>

AI[SeCN] with AI=Li&#8722;Rb were synthesized by oxidation of cyanides with selenium or by metathesis (AI=Cs). Whereas all reactions proceed in solution, LiSeCN can only be obtained solvent free by ball milling. All compounds were crystallographically characterized, their structures optimized by DFT methods and their vibrational spectra recorded. DSC measurements showed congruent melting and allowed for extraction of the melting points.







Abstract
The full series of quasibinary alkali&#8208;metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (A=Li&#8722;Rb) or by metathesis (A=Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O).

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13582-13590, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of DFT calculations, we show that the experimental orthorhombic (Pbca) structure of the argentate AgF2, which displays an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order perpendicular to the long axis of the lattice, comes from a cooperative trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion of (AgF6)4&#8722; complexes in a cubic Pa&#8208;3 high&#8208;symmetry reference phase. As a consequence, the system, displaying three equivalent minima, is ferroelastic and displays a strong magneto&#8208;elastic effect that controls the orientation of the AFM order.







Abstract
In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2 and the cuprate La2CuO4. We explored the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2 by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2. Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2 and AgF2. Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2 is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+ ions occupy trigonal sites that, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local E&#8855;e trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+&#8722;F&#8722; bonds increase their distance by 15&#8201;% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors, and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes might be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, these results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2 is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.

A modern material: A novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric, [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4], has successfully been synthesized; it underwent a reversible structural phase transition around Tc=348&#8197;K, with a wide band gap of 4.43&#8197;eV. The chief contributors to this are the C, H and O atoms of the crystals, the obvious second harmonic generation response and the large value of spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of around 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase transitions are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper is described the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4] (1) that shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348&#8197;K (heating) and 331&#8197;K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17&#8197;K by differential scanning calorimetry measurements, thus indicating that 1 undergoes a reversible structural phase transition. Variable&#8208;temperature PXRD and temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase&#8208;transition behavior of 1. The second harmonic response demonstrates that 1 belongs to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. In its semiconducting properties, 1 shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43&#8197;eV that comes chiefly from the C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of 1 exhibit a typical polarization&#8208;electric hysteresis loop with a large spontaneous polarization (Ps) of about 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic&#8208;inorganic and other hybrid crystals.

         <title>Frontispiece: Mechanistic Aspects of the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>

Among the different reactions that lead to the formation of C&#8722;C bonds, the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura approach has a fundamental role, at the level of basic research and industrial applications. In particular, the palladium is usually the metal of the corresponding catalyst. The complexity of the reaction lies in the individual steps of the cycle, as well as in the generation of the catalytically active species. Here, through a chronology from the beginnings of cross coupling, how far the field has come is analyzed. For more information, see the Review by S. P. Nolan, A. Poater et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;13481.

         <dc:description>
In addition to avoiding the shuttling caused by soluble polysulfides, the design and preparation of sulfur cathodes for Li&#8722;S batteries must overcome challenges such as the low use of S, rapid decay of capacity and poor cycle life. This review spotlights recent progress in improving the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries by employing multifunctional metal phosphides as host materials. The current state of development of sulfur electrodes is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between the essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latter's influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, trends in the development and practical applications of Li&#8722;S batteries are considered. For more information, see the Review by J. Yuan, J. Liu, et&#8197;al. on page 13494&#8197;ff.

The origin of homochirality is one of the unresolved issues of prebiotic chemistry. Why are the amino acids found in proteins of the l configuration? Perhaps peptido nucleotides could have played a role as transitional species, as suggested visually by the Archaeopteryx in the image. It was recently shown that these phosphoramidate&#8208;linked species form spontaneously from simple precursors. Now, the diastereoselectivity of the the dipeptide&#8208;forming step has been determined by in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy, revealing that homochiral products are preferred. This is reported in the Full Paper by C. Richert et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101630).

Shining visible light and passing DC current through a carbon nitride material doped with copper atoms catalyzes the selective reduction of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to an important chemical intermediate, carbon monoxide. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to show how visible light increases the current and activity of the material. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101820).

Reawakening of a forgotten compound class: A researcher who has &#8220;rediscovered&#8221; the selenocyanates as an interesting compound class holds the starting materials of the principal chemical reaction (A = Li&#8211;Cs) in their hands. Against a background of a calculated precession image recorded after successful syntheses and characterization, she contemplates the flame colouration of the full series of quasibinary alkali&#8208;metal selenocyanates that emerge from the oxidation of alkali&#8208;metal cyanides with elemental selenium.

High&#8208;symmetry organometallic sandwiches of lanthanides are of current high interest because of their magnetic and optical properties. When trivalent lanthanide complexes feature the large monoanionic cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligand, an interesting hapticity switching is observed along with a decrease in the size of the metal center. This cover shows the structural evolution from the terbium to the lutecium metal ion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;W. Roesky, G. Nocton, et&#8197;al.

         <title>Multifunctional Metal Phosphides as Superior Host Materials for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13494-13512, September 24, 2021. </description>

Being a good host: Metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid materials have huge potential to boost the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;S batteries. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the use of metal phosphides for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries, in particular with a focus on the modified approaches, design principles, representative applications and development direction.







Abstract
For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage systems with large theoretical specific capacity has been urgently needed because of the rapid development of society. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for novel battery systems, since their resurgence at the end of the 20th century Li&#8722;S batteries have attracted ever more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is almost five times larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the determining factors in Li&#8722;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. For the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect that is caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In past decades, though the sulfur cathode has developed greatly, there are still some enormous challenges to be conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity, and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries by employing multifunctional metal phosphides as host materials. The current state of development of the sulfur electrode of Li&#8722;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between the essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, the chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latter&#8242;s influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, trends in the development and practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries are also pointed out.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>

The complexity of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura C&#8722;C bond formation reaction lies in the indivdual steps of the cycle, as well as in the generation of the catalytically active species. An overview of the topic is provided from a historical perspective.







Abstract
The story of C&#8722;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Quinoidal Polymers Based on Dipyrrolopyrazinedione for Application in All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13527-13533, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers (PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT) based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were developed for the use as polymer acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The all&#8208;PSCs with pseudo&#8208;bilayer structure exhibited PCEs of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;% for PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules and polymers with intrinsic quinoidal structure are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, which have been reported for application in field&#8208;effect transistors and thermoelectric devices. In principle, the molecular and electronic characteristics of quinoidal polymers can also enable their application in organic solar cells. Herein, two quinoidal polymers, named PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were synthesized and used as electron acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Both PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT showed suitable energy levels and wide light absorption range that extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. When combined with the polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the resulting all&#8208;PSCs based on PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;%, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;PSCs was revealed to be mainly limited by the relatively poor and imbalanced charge transport, considerable charge recombination. Detailed investigations on the structure&#8208;performance relationship suggested that synergistic optimization of light absorption, energy levels, and charge transport properties is needed to achieve more successful application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Stereospecific on&#8208;Surface Cyclodehydrogenation of Bishelicenes: Preservation of Handedness from Helical to Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13523-13526, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flattening helices while keeping the handedness: On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of bishelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically to (M,M) and (P,P) chiral planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This is followed by their homochiral aggregation into a 2D conglomerate. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds stereospecifically to chiral, planar coronocoronene. Such a reaction is a special example of topochemistry in which enantiospecific conversion is supported by the alignment of the reactant by the surface.

         <title>Electrocatalytic H2 Generation from Water Relying on Cooperative Ligand Electron Transfer in &#8220;PN3P&#8221; Pincer&#8208;Supported NiII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13518-13522, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards sustainable H2 production: To bring electrocatalytic hydrogen production into the sustainable realm, earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts should function with water as the substrate. These newly reported hydrogen&#8208;generating catalysts of NiII are robust, stable in air and electrocatalytically reduce water to hydrogen with excellent Faradaic efficiency. Computations supplemented our understanding of a unique ligand&#8208;based electron transfer with the cooperativity of the PN3P ligand as an electron reservoir as a requirement for successful catalysis.







Abstract
Water is the most sustainable source for H2 production, and the efficient electrocatalytic production of H2 from mixed water/acetonitrile solutions by using two new air&#8208;stable nickel(II) pincer complexes, [Ni(&#954;3&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=H I, Me II) is reported. Hydrogen generation from H2O/CH3CN solutions is initiated at &#8722;2&#8197;V against Fc+/0, and bulk electrocatalysis studies showed that the catalyst functions with an excellent Faradaic efficiency and a turnover frequency of 160&#8197;s&#8722;1. A DFT computational investigation of the reduction behavior of I and II revealed a correlation of H2 formation with charge donation from electrons originating in a reduced ligand&#8208;localized orbital. As a result, these catalysts are proposed to proceed by a novel mechanism involving electron/proton transfer between a Ni0I species bonded to an anionic PN3P ligand (&#8220;L&#8722;/Ni0I&#8221;) and a NiI&#8208;hydride (&#8220;Ni&#8722;H&#8221;). Furthermore, these catalysts are able to reduce phenol and acetic acid, more active proton sources, at lower potentials that correlate with the substrate pKa.

Keep it simple: A sustainable approach (ethyl acetate under ambient conditions without metals, additives or irradiation) for the synthesis of di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;hydroquinolines bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups has been developed.A Convenient Formal [4+2] Heterocylization Route to Bis(triflyl)tetrahydroquinolines (L&#225;zaro&#8208;Milla and Almendros) @IQOG_CSIC







Abstract
We report the sustainable and efficient synthesis of a new type of quinoline derivatives bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups. The protocol is metal&#8208;, catalyst&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free, involves the use of readily available and stable precursors, and avoids the formation of side products. Also, the mild conditions of the process allow the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.

Au nanoparticles co&#8208;functionalized with guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate zwitterions (GCPZ) and guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylates (GCP) show a a multi&#8208;pH&#8208;controlled and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly in water. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the Au nanoparticles possess seven alternating regimes in which they are assembled/disassembled, simply controlled by pH and temperature.







Abstract
We report a pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8208;nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water, based on their surface modification with cationic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) and zwitterionic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate (GCPZ) binding motifs. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self&#8208;assemble at pH&#8197;1, pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;13, whereas they disassemble at pH&#8197;3 and pH&#8197;11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH&#8197;1 and pH&#8197;13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13513-13517, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper substituted graphitic carbon nitride is shown to be a photoactive electrocatalyst for the two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO. Electrocatalytic activity as measured by yield and faradaic efficiency is increased upon irradiation with visible light. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra measured in the presence of visible light exhibit pronounced, &gt;1&#8197;eV, light&#8208;induced shifts to lower binding energies representing significant photoconductivity.







Abstract
Research on the photoreduction of CO2 often has been dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO2 reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8722;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO as a major product (&gt;95&#8201;%) and formic acid (&lt;5&#8201;%). The results show that at a potential of &#8722;2.5&#8197;V versus Fc\Fc+ the CO2 reduction activity of Cu&#8722;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25&#8201;% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%. Independently, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8722;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration.

     alt="Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copper substituted graphitic&lt;/b&gt; carbon nitride is shown to be a photoactive electrocatalyst for the two-electron reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. Electrocatalytic activity as measured by yield and faradaic efficiency is increased upon irradiation with visible light. X-ray photoelectron spectra measured in the presence of visible light exhibit pronounced, &amp;gt;1&#8197;eV, light-induced shifts to lower binding energies representing significant photoconductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on the photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; often has been dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper-substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8722;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two-electron reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO as a major product (&amp;gt;95&#8201;%) and formic acid (&amp;lt;5&#8201;%). The results show that at a potential of &#8722;2.5&#8197;V versus Fc\Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity of Cu&#8722;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25&#8201;% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%. Independently, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8722;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo-assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting tetrahydrides: First&#8208;principles calculations show that the distance between the hydrogen atoms comprising the quasi&#8208;molecular H2 units in the metal tetrahydrides that emerge as being stable under pressure can be tuned via the choice of the metal, as well as chemical and physical pressure. Vibrations of the H&#8722;H bond are important for the superconducting mechanism.







Abstract
Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr2Si2 structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these 
 symmetry MH4 compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H
 units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH4, ScH4 and ZrH4 reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H
 units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH4, modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms are also key contributors, and soften substantially at lower pressures.

         <title>Revised Structures of Dehydrostenines A and B: Total Syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;Dehydrostenine A and Structure Assigned to Dehydrostenine B</title>

         <dc:description>
The first total syntheses of the Stemona alkaloid dehydrostenine A and the structure assigned to dehydrostenine B have been completed from a simple pyrrole substrate in 10 and 11 steps, respectively. Two independent Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular Michael additions were exploited to construct the tetracyclic dehydrostenine core. As a result of our synthetic studies and associated analysis of the relevant literature, we propose revisions of the structures originally assigned to dehydrostenines A and B.

         <title>The Synthesis of Porous Na3V2(PO4)3 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. We first review the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials. Furthermore, we outline the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field.







Abstract
Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to its excellent structural stability and rapid Na+ conductivity. However, its electrochemical performances are restricted by the large bulk structure and poor electronic conductivity. The construction of porous NVP materials is a powerful method to improve the electrochemical properties. This concept aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. Herein, the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials are reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field are outlined.

         <title>Protection of Ag Clusters by Metal&#8208;Oxo Modules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules have emerged as the new stars of silver nanoclusters, exhibiting enhanced and unique properties. Three types of metal&#8208;oxo modules are identified in these systems. Some insights into fabricating such clusters and problems to be solved are discussed in this Concept article.







Abstract
Monodisperse and atomically precise Ag nanoclusters have attracted considerable recent research interest. A conventional silver cluster usually consists of a silver metallic kernel and an organic peripheral ligand shell. Nevertheless, the present inevitable problem is the unsatisfied stability of such nanoclusters. In this concept, we will give an introduction to Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules, which exhibit enhanced stability and unique properties. Accordingly, three different types of clusters are summarized: (1) Ag clusters protected by mononuclear oxometallates; (2) Ag clusters protected by block&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters; (3) Ag clusters protected by hollow&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters. The aim of this concept is to offer possible general guidance and insight into future rational design of more metal&#8208;oxo clusters protected silver clusters or even other coinage metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Halogenation of Phenylalanine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The link is shown between a pioneering chemist's questioning &#8211; drawing and sharing thoughts on a blackboard &#8211; and a solution by means of modern catalytic tools &#8211; illustrated by computer lettering. Our question was how to regioselectively introduce a halogen atom into valuable phenylalanine derivatives without using a heavy protecting group in order to rapidly construct nonproteinogenic amino acids. The proposed solution was a Pd&#8208;catalyzed and sustainable regioselective C&#8722;H halogenation process directed by a native amine functional group.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Prospect and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein, we summarize the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Then, we also introduce the recent new insight about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal expansion properties and mechanochemical synthesis of stoichiometric cocrystals containing tetrabromobenzene as a hydrogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bond donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of the Peripheral Functionalization Chemistry of meso&#8208;Free Corroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since reliable synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles were developed, the peripheral functionalization chemistry of corroles has blossomed again. In this Minireview, classical electrophilic reactions, SNAr reactions, and unique oxidation behavior are introduced, and their impact on the structures, electronic states, optical properties, and aromaticities of corroles are highlighted.







Abstract
In contrast to the extensive development of the meso&#8208;functionalization of porphyrins, that of corroles had rarely been explored until the development of practical synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles in 2015. The ready availability of meso&#8208;free corroles opened up meso&#8208;functionalization chemistry of corroles, giving rise to successful synthesis of various meso&#8208;substituted corroles such as meso&#8208;halogen, meso&#8208;nitro, meso&#8208;amino, meso&#8208;oxo, and meso&#8208;iminocorroles as well as meso&#8211;meso&#8208;linked corrole dimers and corrole tapes. In some cases, 2NH corroles exist as stable or transient radical species. The impact of meso&#8208;functionalization on the structures, electronic properties, optical characteristics, and aromaticity of corroles are highlighted in this Minireview.

         <title>DNA Adduct Detection after Post&#8208;Labeling Technique with PCR Amplification (DNA&#8208;ADAPT&#8211;qPCR) Identifies the Pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA Gene as a Direct Target of Platinum&#8211;Acridine Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DNA damage caused by a platinum&#8211;acridine agent in cancer cells was studied by using an assay that combines post&#8208;labeling of click chemistry&#8208;enabled DNA adducts, affinity pull&#8208;down purification, and PCR amplification. The method demonstrates that rDNA repeats are a cellular, and potentially pharmacological, target of the hybrid agents.







Abstract
To study the DNA damage caused by a potent platinum&#8211;acridine anticancer agent (PA) in cancer cells, an assay based on biorthogonal post&#8208;labeling using a click chemistry&#8208;enabled, azide&#8208;modified derivative (APA) was developed. The method involves biotinylation, affinity capture, and bead&#8208;based enrichment of APA&#8208;modified genomic DNA. The key steps of the assay were validated and optimized in model duplexes, including full&#8208;length plasmids, restriction fragments, and a DNA ladder. Native DNA treated with APA and subsequently subjected to post&#8208;labeling with a biotin affinity tag was enzymatically digested and fragments were analyzed by in&#8208;line LC&#8211;MS and MS/MS. The monofunctional&#8211;intercalative adducts formed by APA in 5&#8242;&#8208;pyrimidine/guanine sequences in double&#8208;stranded DNA were quantitatively biotinylated by strain&#8208;promoted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition chemistry. When applied to DNA extracted from A549 lung cancer cells, the assay in combination with qPCR amplification demonstrates that platinum&#8211;acridines form adducts in the gene sequences encoding pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA, a potential pharmacological target of these agents.

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Blue OLEDs with EQE up to 7.5% Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with HLCT state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, we successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters,  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  and  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  , featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high PLQYs and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  and  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an EQE  max  of 4.32% and 5.41%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  was achieved with an excellent CE  max  of 5.83 cd A  &#8208;1  , EQE  max  of 4.6% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly,  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  &#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQE  max  of 7.51% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIE  y&#160;  &#65308;&#160;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T  7  to S  2  . Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Supramolecular Organic Frameworks Constructed by Amidinium&#8208;Carboxylate Salt Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation, TPE4+, and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. These self&#8208;assembled structures can be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli and are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8201;%&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation.







Abstract
We report here a set of fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) that incorporate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) units within their frameworks. The fluorescent SOFs of this study were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation TPE4+ and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray di&#64256;raction analyses revealed that the length of the dicarboxylate anion bridges has a considerable impact on the structural features of the resulting frameworks. Nevertheless, all SOFs prepared in the context of the present study were found to display emissive features characteristic of TPE&#8208;based AIE luminogens with only a modest dependence on the structural specifics being seen. The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli. This reversible structural behavior is consistent with their SOF nature.

         <title>Hybrid EuIII Coordination Luminophore Standing on Two Legs on Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hold tight, shine bright: A novel method for the development of lanthanide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, taking advantage of an EuIII complex with an organic ligand covalently bound to the silica nanoparticle supports at two binding sites has been demonstrated. The hybrid nanoluminophore exhibited higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previous EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials.







Abstract
In this study, we have demonstrated a two&#8208;legged, upright molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent LnIII&#8208;silica nanomaterials. A novel EuIII&#8208;silica hybrid nanoparticle was developed by using a doubly binding TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 (TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) linker. The TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 was confirmed by 1H, 31P, 29Si NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Luminescent Eu(hfa)3 and Eu(tfc)3 moieties (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3&#8208;(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed onto TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3&#8208;modified silica nanoparticles, producing Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2 and Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2, respectively. Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 exhibited the higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 showed an extra&#8208;large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54&#8201;%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3)2 was found to be 39&#8201;%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 linker is a promising candidate for development of EuIII&#8208;based luminescent materials.

         <title>Large Isotope Effects in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs, kH/kD) above the typical limit of 7 are reviewed, for organometallic reaction types from protonation of clusters to catalytic C&#8722;H activation. The KIEs are as large as 105, or even so large that reactivity is unobserved for deuterium. Large KIEs in organometallics have been explained by a combination of (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step.







Abstract
The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is key to understanding reaction mechanisms in many areas of chemistry and chemical biology, including organometallic chemistry. This ratio of rate constants, kH/kD, typically falls between 1&#8211;7. However, KIEs up to 105 have been reported, and can even be so large that reactivity with deuterium is unobserved. We collect here examples of large KIEs across organometallic chemistry, in catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, along with their mechanistic interpretations. Large KIEs occur in proton transfer reactions such as protonation of organometallic complexes and clusters, protonolysis of metal&#8211;carbon bonds, and dihydrogen reactivity. C&#8722;H activation reactions with large KIEs occur with late and early transition metals, photogenerated intermediates, and abstraction by metal&#8208;oxo complexes. We categorize the mechanistic interpretations of large KIEs into the following three types: (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step. This comprehensive collection of large KIEs in organometallics provides context for future mechanistic interpretation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new method of synthesis of extended perylenes and terrylenes. The technique is based on the cascade dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) of aryl aldehydes, where stepwise annulations activate previously &#8220;dormant&#8221; substituents. Two&#8208;fold and four&#8208;fold cyclizations of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehydes offer a rapid path to unsymmetrical perylenes and elusive terrylene derivatives, respectively. DPEX of 3,3''&#8208;(phenanthrene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl)bis (([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)) leads to the biradical structure, which in situ proceeds into oxidative electrocyclization at room temperature. The described domino process complements and expands DPEX approach to a large family of fused acenes and related PAHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Determination of Relative Stabilities of Metal&#8208;Peptide Bonds in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding binding site preferences in biological systems as well as affinities to binding partners is a crucial aspect in metallodrug development. We here present a mass spectrometrybased method to compare relative stabilities of metal&#8208;peptide adducts in the gas phase. Angiotensin 1 and substance P were used as model peptides. Incubation with isostructural N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of Ru II , Os II , Rh III , and Ir III led to the formation of various adducts, which were subsequently studied by energy&#8208;resolved fragmentation experiments. The gas phase stability of the metalpeptide bonds depended on the metal and the binding partner. Of the four complexes used, the Os II derivative binds strongest to Met, while Ru II forms the most stable coordination bond with His. Rh III was identified as the weakest peptide binder and Ir III formed peptide adducts with intermediate stability.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding binding site preferences in biological systems as well as affinities to binding partners is a crucial aspect in metallodrug development. We here present a mass spectrometrybased method to compare relative stabilities of metal-peptide adducts in the gas phase. Angiotensin 1 and substance P were used as model peptides.

The asymmetric catalytic synthesis of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines by using a three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar&#8208;cycloaddition reaction is investigated.







Abstract
An asymmetric three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinolines, bromoacetates and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amide is realized by using a chiral N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;Y(OTf)3 complex as the catalyst. The process includes a base&#8208;promoted formation of dihydroisoquinolium ylides in&#8197;situ, and a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amides. A series of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines are obtained in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous PdNi/Ni nanoparticles assembled nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) have been synthesized via replacement reaction, in which nickel nanowires serve as sacrificial template to form tubular structure and the diblock copolymer induce the formation of mesoporous structures. Due to the mesoporous nanoparticle structure and tubular geometry, the mPdNi/Ni NTs have better catalytic performance than mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black for ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibite superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.

         <title>Ultrahigh Rate Capability and Lifespan MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF Electrode for High Performance Battery&#8208;Type Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoflower structural MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite prepared by in&#8197;situ growth of Ni&#8208;MOF on the surface of MnCo2O4 nanorods derived from Co/Mn&#8208;MOF at 600&#8201;&#176;C has a high cycling stability and outstanding rate performance as supercapacitor electrode material.







Abstract
MnCo2O4 is derived from a Co/Mn bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). Then Ni&#8208;MOF is directly grown on the surface of the obtained MnCo2O4 to form a nano&#8208;flower structure with small balls. A large surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo2O4 and porosity of Ni&#8208;MOF allow the prepared MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite material to deliver an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, an appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo2O4 precursor is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo2O4 and electrochemical performances of the resulted composite material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo2O4&#8208;600/Ni&#8208;MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance (when the current density increases from 1 to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41&#8201;%) and good cycle stability (the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74&#8201;% after 20&#8201;000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF has a good application prospect in the market.

A novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300&#8197;nm) and suitable band structure was successfully synthesized, and it functioned as an efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalytst for photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines under the irradiation of white (400&#8211;830&#8197;nm), and red light (660&#8211;680&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Imines are important intermediates in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imines and has attracted great attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8211;1300&#8197;nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97&#8201;%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.

         <title>Photoinduced Water Oxidation in Chitosan Nanostructures Containing Covalently Linked RuII Chromophores and Encapsulated Iridium Oxide Nanoparticles</title>

Restricted environment frees up reaction: Chitosan fibers with covalently linked RuII polypyridine complexes and encapsulated IrO2 nanoparticles exhibit a remarkable quantum yield of 0.21 for photoinduced water oxidation in sacrificial schemes. The restricted environment is held responsible for accelerating electron transfer steps, which are considered to be the basis of the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic process.







Abstract
The luminophore Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)2+ (bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; dcbpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) is covalently linked to a chitosan polymer; crosslinking by tripolyphosphate produced Ru&#8208;decorated chitosan fibers (NS&#8208;RuCh), with a 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between chitosan repeating units and RuII chromophores. The properties of the RuII compound are unperturbed by the chitosan structure, with NS&#8208;RuCh exhibiting the typical metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) absorption and emission bands of RuII complexes. When crosslinks are made in the presence of IrO2 nanoparticles, such species are encapsulated within the nanofibers, thus generating the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system, in which both RuII photosensitizers and IrO2 water oxidation catalysts are within the nanofiber structures. NS&#8208;RuCh and IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh have been characterized by dynamic light scattering, scanning electronic microscopy, and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis, which indicated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between RuII chromophores and IrO2 species. Photochemical water oxidation has been investigated by using IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh as the chromophore/catalyst assembly and persulfate anions as the sacrificial species: photochemical water oxidation yields O2 with a quantum yield (&#934;) of 0.21, definitely higher than the &#934; obtained with a similar solution containing separated Ru(bpy)32+ and IrO2 nanoparticles (0.05) or with respect to that obtained when using NS&#8208;RuCh and &#8220;free&#8221; IrO2 nanoparticles (0.10). A fast hole&#8208;scavenging process (rate constant, 7&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) involving the oxidized photosensitizer and the IrO2 catalyst within the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system is behind the improved photochemical quantum yield of IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh.

         <title>Supported CuII Single&#8208;Ion Catalyst for Total Carbon Utilization of C2 and C3 Biomass&#8208;Based Platform Molecules in the N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste not, want not: Oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based carbonyl sources such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde is catalyzed by very few CuII single sites in zeolite 5A with unprecedented 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms.







Abstract
The shift from fossil carbon sources to renewable ones is vital for developing sustainable chemical processes to produce valuable chemicals. In this work, value&#8208;added formamides were synthesized in good yields by the reaction of amines with C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based platform molecules such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. These feedstocks were selectively converted by catalysts based on Cu&#8208;containing zeolite 5A through the in&#8197;situ formation of carbonyl&#8208;containing intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which all the carbon atoms in biomass&#8208;based feedstocks could be amidated to produce formamide. Combined catalyst characterization results revealed preferably single CuII sites on the surface of Cu/5A, some of which form small clusters, but without direct linking via oxygen bridges. By combining the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin&#8208;trapping, operando attenuated total reflection (ATR) IR spectroscopy and control experiments, it was found that the formation of formamides might involve a HCOOH&#8208;like intermediate and .NHPh radicals, in which the selective formation of .OOH radicals might play a key role.

         <title>Synthesis, Mechanism Elucidation and Biological Insights of Tellurium(IV)&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the search for bioactive organotellurium compounds, promising hypervalent TeIV&#8208;containing heterocycles with possible biological applications have been obtained. 125Te NMR of a series of 16 halogenated organotelluranes confirms that these products contain a Te&#8722;O bond within the five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring. We describe their synthesis, identification of the most favorable mechanism and diastereoselectivity, stability assays and in&#8197;vitro potential against L.&#8197;amazonensis.







Abstract
Inspired by the synthetic and biological potential of organotellurium substances, a series of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring organotelluranes containing a Te&#8722;O bond were synthesized and characterized. Theoretical calculations elucidated the mechanism for the oxidation&#8208;cyclization processes involved in the formation of the heterocycles, consistent with chlorine transfer to hydroxy telluride, followed by a cyclization step with simultaneous formation of the new Te&#8722;O bond and deprotonation of the OH group. Moreover, theoretical calculations also indicated anti&#8208;diastereoisomers to be major products for two chirality center&#8211;containing compounds. Antileishmanial assays against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes disclosed 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurane LQ50 (IC50=4.1&#177;1.0; SI=12), 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurolane LQ04 (IC50=7.0&#177;1.3; SI=7) and 1,2&#955;4&#8208;benzoxatellurole LQ56 (IC50=5.7&#177;0.3; SI=6) as more powerful and more selective compounds than the reference, being up to four times more active. A stability study supported by 125Te NMR analyses showed that these heterocycles do not suffer structural modifications in aqueous&#8208;organic media or at temperatures up to 65&#8201;&#176;C.

Within this series the Gd  III  analogue represents a special case since it shows both structural types as well as a third Mn  2  Ln  2  inverse butterfly motif. Variation in reaction conditions allows access to different structure types across the whole series. This prompts further studies into the reaction mechanism of this cluster assisted self&#8208;assembly approach. For the Mn  7  Ln  3  analogues reported here variable&#8208;temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin carriers are dominant. Compounds incorporating Ln=Nd  III  (  2  ), Sm  III  (  3  ) and Gd  III  (  5  ) display SMM behaviour. The slow relaxation of the magnetization for these compounds was confirmed by ac measurements above 1.8 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a Red&#8208;Emitting Viscosity Sensitive BODIPY Fluorophore for Intracellular Viscosity Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viscosity imaging at a microscopic scale can provide important information about biosystems, including the development of serious illnesses. Microviscosity imaging is achievable with viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores, the most popular of which are based on the BODIPY group. However, most of the BODIPY probes fluoresce green light, whereas the red luminescence is desired for the imaging of biological samples. Designing a new viscosity probe with suitable spectroscopic properties is a challenging task because it is difficult to preserve viscosity sensitivity after modifying the molecular structure. Here we describe how we developed a new red&#8208;emitting, viscosity sensitive, BODIPY fluorophore BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 that is suitable for reliable intracellular viscosity imaging of lipid droplets in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. The design of BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 was aided by DFT calculations that allowed a successful prediction of the viscosity sensitivity of fluorophores before synthesis. In summary, we report a new red viscosity probe possessing monoexponential fluorescence decay that makes it attractive for lifetime&#8208;based viscosity imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere&#8208;Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spheres of influence: Hollow carbon nanospheres implanted in the surface plane of carbon nitride curly nanosheets were synthesized by thermal polymerization of freeze&#8208;dried urea and a NCS precursor. When the CN/NCS photocatalyst is irradiated by visible light, electron&#8208;hole pairs are generated in CN, then the electrons in the conduction bands of CN are transferred to the NCS. This results in efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with a high H2 production rate and notable quantum yield.







Abstract
A novel hybrid photocatalyst composed of hollow carbon nanospheres (NCS) and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) curly nanosheets has been prepared by the calcination of a NCS precursor and freeze&#8208;dried urea. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits an efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with a highest H2 generation rate of 3612.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, leading to an apparent quantum yield of 10.04&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, five times higher than the widely reported benchmark photocatalyst CN (2.01&#8201;% AQY). The materials characterization shows that NCS&#8208;modified CN curly nanosheets can promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through their special coupling interface and NCS as an electron acceptor, which significantly improves the photocatalytic efficiency. Thus, this study provides an efficient strategy for the design of highly efficient photocatalyst, particularly suitable for a totally metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2](P2BCy4  =&#160;1,2&#8208;  bis  (di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane)is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron&#160;k1  &#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the&#160;P  2  B  Cy  4  secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)  8  ] with PhI provides [Ni  II  (P  2  B  Cy  4  )  2  (DMAP)  8  (I)]I  via  iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and&#160;  not  a [Ni  II  (Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an interesting secondary sphere effect. Last, the reactivity of [Ni  0  (P  2  B  Cy  4  )  2  ] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Osmaindenes: Synthesis and Reversible Mechanochromism Characteristics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of osmaindenes bearing different substituents have been synthesized by nucleophilic reaction and fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The solid&#8208;state fluorescence emissions, mechanochromism properties of these complexes have been explored. The experimental results indicated that different substituents play a role in regulating their solid&#8208;state fluorescence colors and all of the target molecules show reversible mechanochromism.







Abstract
A series of novel osmaindenes 1&#8211;6 bearing different substituents (CF3, H, I, Br, OCH3, N(Ph)2) has been synthesized by nucleophilic reaction of water with the corresponding aromatic osmanaphthalyne complexes. All osmaindenes 1&#8211;6 have been characterized by elemental analysis (EA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, although the low solubilities of 3 and 4 precluded the accumulation of their 13C NMR spectra. Osmaindenes 2, 3 and 5 have also been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Subsequently, through solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, mechanochromic studies, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we found that osmaindenes 1&#8211;6 fluoresce at wavelengths in the range 500&#8211;800&#8197;nm, while also displaying reversible mechanochromic properties. The solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission of 1 after grinding extends into the near&#8208;infrared region. This research provides new insight into the design and synthesis of metallic materials with excellent mechanochromic properties.

         <title>Breathing Effect via Solvent Inclusions on the Linker Rotational Dynamics of Functionalized MIL&#8208;53</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The breathing effects of functionalized MIL&#8208;53 induced by the inclusion of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The alteration of NMR chemical shifts indicates the phase transitions from narrow pore to large pore forms. The host&#8208;guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2, MIL&#8208;53&#8208;CH3 would significantly reduce the rotational frequency of linkers.







Abstract
The breathing effects of functionalized MIL&#8208;53&#8208;X (X=H, CH3, NH2, OH, and NO2) induced by the inclusions of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. 2D homo&#8208;nuclear correlation NMR provided direct experimental evidence for the host&#8208;guest interaction between the guest solvents and the MOF frameworks. The variations of the 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR chemical shifts in functionalized MIL&#8208;53 from the narrow pore phase transitions to large pore forms due to solvent inclusions were clearly identified. The influence of functionalized linkers and their host&#8208;guest interactions with the confined solvents on the rotational dynamics of the linkers was examined by separated&#8208;local&#8208;field MAS NMR experiments in conjunction with DFT theoretical calculations. It is found that the linker rotational dynamics of functionalized MIL&#8208;53 in narrow pore form is closely related to the computational rotational energy barrier. The BDC&#8208;NO2 linker of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2 undergoes relatively faster rotation, whereas the BDC&#8208;NH2 and BDC&#8208;OH linkers of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NH2 and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;OH exhibit relatively slower rotation. The host&#8208;guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2, MIL&#8208;53&#8208;CH3 would significantly induce an increase of the order parameters of unsubstituted carbon and reduce the rotational frequency of linkers. This study provides a spectroscopic approach for the investigation of linker rotation in functionalized MOFs at natural abundance with solvents inclusions.

The 36&#8208;NiII&#8208;containing 54&#8208;tungsto&#8208;6&#8208;silicate, [Ni36(OH)18(H2O)36(SiW9O34)6]6&#8722; (Ni36) was discovered and shown to contain more nickel centers than any other polyoxometalate (POMs) known to date. Polyanion Ni36 comprises six equivalent {NiII6SiW9} units which are linked by Ni&#8722;O&#8722;W bridges forming a macrocyclic assembly. Magnetic studies indicate antiferromagnetic communication between the six {Ni6} subunits. Electrochemical studies indicate that the first reduction is reversible and associated to the WVI/V couple while the second reduction is irreversible and associated to the NiII/0 couple.







Abstract
The 36&#8208;NiII&#8208;containing 54&#8208;tungsto&#8208;6&#8208;silicate, [Ni36(OH)18(H2O)36(SiW9O34)6]6&#8722; (Ni36) was synthesized by a simple one&#8208;pot reaction of the Ni2&#8208;pivalate complex [Ni2(&#956;&#8208;OH2)(O2CCMe3)4(HO2CCMe3)4] with the trilacunary [SiW9O34]10&#8722; polyanion precursor in water and structurally characterized by a multitude of physicochemical techniques including single&#8208;crystal XRD, FTIR, TGA, elemental analysis, magnetic and electrochemical studies. Polyanion Ni36 comprises six equivalent {NiII6SiW9} units which are linked by Ni&#8722;O&#8722;W bridges forming a macrocyclic assembly. Magnetic studies demonstrate that the {Ni6} building blocks in Ni36 remain magnetically intact while forming a hexagonal ring with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between adjacent {Ni6} units. Electrochemical studies indicate that the first reduction is reversible and associated with the WVI/V couple, whereas the second reduction is irreversible attributed to the NiII/0 couple.

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (  2  ) and trimer (  3  ) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in  2  adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore,  3  forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that  2  has a larger strain energy than  3  owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH  2  Cl  2  solution. The spectra of both  2  and  3  are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety. These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (  &#981;  = 0.70&#8211;0.82) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|  g  CPL  | = 1.6 &#215; 10  &#8211;3  ) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a chemoselectivity switchable flowmicro reaction to generate reactive and unstable intermediates. The switchable chemoselectivity of this reaction enables a selection for one of two different intermediates, an aryllithium or a benzyl lithium, at will from the same starting material. Starting from bromo&#8208;substituted styrenes, the aryllithium intermediates were converted to the substituted styrenes, whereas the benzyl lithium intermediates were engaged in an anionic polymerization. These chemoselectivity&#8208;switchable reactions can be integrated to produce polymers that cannot be formed during typical polymerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The availability and synthesis of fluorinated enamine derivatives such as N&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropenyl)heterocycles are challenging, especially through direct functionalization of the heterocyclic scaffold. Herein, we describe a stereoselective N&#8208;trifluoropropenylation method based on the use of a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropenyl iodonium salt. This reagent enables the straightforward trifluoropropenylation of various N&#8208;heterocycles under mild reaction conditions, providing trifluoromethyl enamine type moieties with high stereoselectivity and efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene (C60) Microstructures Featuring Surface Cracks with Enhanced Photoluminescence and Microscopic Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface cracks could improve the optical and photoelectronic properties of crystalline materials due to the increased specific surface area, but controlled self&#8208;assembly of fullerene (C60) molecules into micro&#8208;/nanostructures with surface cracks is still challenging. Herein, we report the morphology engineering of novel C60 microstructures bearing surface cracks for the first time, selecting phenetole and n&#8208;propanol (NPA) as the good and poor solvents, respectively. Our systematic investigations reveal that phenetole molecules initially participate in the formation of the ends of the C60 microstructures, and then NPA molecules are involved in the gradual growth of the sidewalls of the microstructures. Therefore, the surface cracks of C60 microstructures can be finely regulated by adjusting the addition of NPA and the crystallization time. Interestingly, the cracked C60 microstructures show superior photoluminescence properties relative to the smooth microstructures due to the increased specific surface area. Besides, C60 microstructures with wide cracks show preferential recognition of silica particles over C60 particles owing to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged C60 microstructures and the positively charged silica microparticles. Our work introduces surface cracks into C60 crystals for the first time, demonstrating their potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Local field induced mass transfer: New insight in nano&#8208;electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unravelling complex kinetics of electrocatalysis is essential for the design of electrocatalysts with high performance. Mass transfer and electron transfer are two primary factors need to be optimized in order to enhance electrocatalytic reaction. Utilization of nano&#8208;catalysts proves to be promising ways promoting performance of electrocatalytic reactions, which is usually attributed to their ability of enhancing the electron transfer. However, when catalysts downsize to the nanoscale, their size is comparable to the thickness of electrical double layer, so that curvatures of nano&#8208;catalysts may lead to inhomogeneous local electric field on the electrode, which then changes essentially the mass transfer. In this review, we introduce the new concept of local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer in nano&#8208;electrocatalytic systems, and provide a brief review of recent progresses revealing its effect on nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, which may bring new insight in future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Functional Interface with Built&#8208;in Catalytic and Self&#8208;Oxidation Sites for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than a separator: An integrated functional interface on separator of lithium&#8722;sulfur battery is fabricated with graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowires (G@MC). The G@MC possesses &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; catalytic Mn2+ sites and good electronic conductivity, which endows the batteries with fast kinetic conversion of polysulfides and rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. The reversible and strong chemical interaction between intermediates and G@MC is beneficial for achieving enhanced cycling stability and rate capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have attracted great attention due to their high theoretical energy density. The rapid redox conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is effective for solving the serious shuttle effect and improving the utilization of active materials. The functional design of the separator interface with fast charge transfer and active catalytic sites is desirable for accelerating the conversion of intermediates. Herein, a graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowire (G@MC) was prepared and utilized to engineer the separator interface. G@MC with active Mn2+ sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn&#8722;S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+ sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS via the spontaneous &#8220;self&#8208;redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC&#8208;based battery exhibits only 0.038&#8201;% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0&#8197;C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li&#8722;S batteries.

A photoswitchable ionic conductivity of spiropyran&#8208;based composite polymer electrolyte is developed and demonstrated. The photoisomerization of the spiropyran derivative results in a tunable ionic conductivity with a maximum 30&#8201;% difference under UV and visible irradiations. The quantitative and qualitative ATR&#8208;FTIR data reveal the interactions of the ions and the grafted molecules at the interfaces. The knowledge obtained from this work provides a potential platform for synthetic electrolytes with tailored conducting functionality.







Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) with smart, stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics have gained considerable attention owing to their noninvasive manipulation and applications in future technologies. To address this potential, in this work, we demonstrate photoresponsive composite polymer electrolytes, consisting of gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) and spiropyran&#8208;immobilized nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (SP&#8208;AAO) templates. Under UV irradiation, the close SP form isomerizes to the open merocyanine (MC) form, creating extremely polarized AAO surfaces; whereas, under visible light irradiation, the MC form reverts to the SP form, creating neutral surface conditions. The electrostatic interactions between ions and AAO surfaces are investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, the behavior of ionic conductivity of the GPE@SP&#8208;AAO is found to be consistent with the kinetics of isomerization tracked by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This work provides a promising platform for developing next&#8208;generation photoelectronic smart devices.

         <title>Seven&#8208;Membered Cyclic Potassium Diamidoalumanyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven&#8208;membered cyclic potassium diamidoalumanyls react with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(sp3)&#8722;H bond and as a nucleophile with BPh3 and RN=C=NR (R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al&#8208;B&#8208; and Al&#8208;C&#8208;bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina&#8208;amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium with 18&#8208;cr&#8208;6 or 2,2,2&#8208;cryptand to provide either Al&#8722;K bonded or charge&#8208;separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; alumanyl anion.







Abstract
The seven&#8208;membered cyclic potassium alumanyl species, [{SiNMes}AlK]2 [{SiNMes}={CH2SiMe2N(Mes)}2; Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2], which adopts a dimeric structure supported by flanking K&#8208;aryl interactions, has been isolated either by direct reduction of the iodide precursor, [{SiNMes}AlI], or in a stepwise manner via the intermediate dialumane, [{SiNMes}Al]2. Although the intermediate dialumane has not been observed by reduction of a Dipp&#8208;substituted analogue (Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3), partial oxidation of the potassium alumanyl species, [{SiNDipp}AlK]2, where {SiNDipp}={CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2, provided the extremely encumbered dialumane [{SiNDipp}Al]2. [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 reacts with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(sp3)&#8208;H bond to provide the benzyl hydridoaluminate, [{SiNDipp}AlH(CH2Ph)]K, and as a nucleophile with BPh3 and RN=C=NR (R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al&#8208;B&#8208; and Al&#8208;C&#8208;bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina&#8208;amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium. Equimolar reactions with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 result in the corresponding monomeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiNDipp}Al&#8722;K(18&#8208;cr&#8208;6)], which provides a rare example of a direct Al&#8722;K contact. In contrast, complete encapsulation of the potassium cation of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2, either by an excess of 18&#8208;cr&#8208;6 or 2,2,2&#8208;cryptand, allows the respective isolation of bright orange charge&#8208;separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; [{SiNDipp}Al]&#8722; alumanyl anion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on this moiety indicate HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps in the of order 200&#8211;250&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Metathesis of P=C Bonds Catalyzed by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic transformation of a P=C bond to C=C and P=P bonds is disclosed. Treating phosphaalkenes (ArP=CPh2) with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (10&#8197;mol% NHC) affords Ph2C=CPh2 and cyclo&#8208;[ArP]n (n=3&#8208;6) which are formally cyclic oligomers of ArP=PAr. Mechanistic studies reveal that this remarkable catalytic transformation proceeds via initial formation of NHC=PAr which is subsequently transformed into cyclo&#8208;(ArP)2CPh2 and cyclo&#8208;(ArP)4CPh2. Phosphaalkene metathesis highlights the close analogy between P=C and C=C bonds.







Abstract
The catalytic metathesis of C=C bonds is a textbook reaction that has no parallel in the widely studied area of multiple bonds involving heavier p&#8208;block elements. A high&#8208;yielding P=C bond metathesis of phosphaalkenes (ArP=CPh2, Ar=Mes, o&#8208;Tol, Ph) has been discovered that is catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC=Me2IMe, Me2IiPr). The products are cyclic oligomers formally derived from ArP=PAr [i.&#8201;e. cyclo&#8208;(ArP)n; n=3, 4, 5, 6] and Ph2C=CPh2. Preliminary mechanistic studies of this remarkable transformation have established NHC=PAr (Ar=Mes, o&#8208;Tol, Ph) as key phosphinidene transfer agents. In addition, novel cyclic intermediates, such as, cyclo&#8208;(ArP)2CPh2 and cyclo&#8208;(ArP)4CPh2 have also been observed. This work represents a rare application of non&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for transformations involving main&#8208;group elements.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Propensity in Solution: Direct Observation and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind  coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind  accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochromic Luminescence (MCL) of Purely Organic Two&#8208;Component Dyes: Wide&#8208;Range MCL over 300&#8197;nm and Two&#8208;Step MCL by Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of two&#8208;component dyes has proven to be an effective strategy to achieve remarkable mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) properties. The shift of the maximum emission wavelength (&#916;&#955;em) range of a bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine derivative has been significantly improved by mixing it with typical organic dyes that do not exhibit MCL behavior. Most notably, a wide&#8208;range MCL (&#916;&#955;em=340&#8197;nm) has been achieved for a mixture with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step MCL has been realized by mixing with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Ito, T.&#8197;Tachikawa, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102700).

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Spectrum of the First Excited State of Au2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoclusters have surprising and interesting optical and catalytic properties. Understanding of the electronic structure of the prototypical Au2+ dimer gives us the tools we need to understand more complex systems that are dominated by the strong relativistic effects and spin&#8211;orbit coupling of gold. The first optical spectrum of the low&#8208;lying excited electronic state of cold Au2+ obtained by Ar tagging is exceptionally well resolved, and its surprisingly simple vibronic structure provides detailed information about structure and bonding in the ground and first excited states. More information can be found in the Communication by M.&#8197;F&#246;rstel, O.&#8197;Dopfer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102542).

         <dc:description>
A biophysical analysis of nucleic acid duplexes containing the unnatural hydrophobic base pair (d)NaM&#8208;dTPT3 provides an understanding of the type of molecular level interactions that could contribute to variabilities in replication, transcription and translation in a semisynthetic organism. Such approaches could provide a basis for comprehending the behavior of other unnatural base pairs (spheres top left) with a view towards unrestricted expansion of the genetic alphabet and code (spheres bottom&#8208;right) in a semisynthetic organism.

         <title>Switching the Mechanism of NADH Photooxidation by Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of three Ru(II) polypyridine complexes was investigated for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)  +  in water. A combination of (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic studies and photocatalysis experiments revealed that ligand design can be used to control the mechanism of the photooxidation: For prototypical Ru(II) complexes a  1  O  2  pathway was found.  Rudppz  ([(tbbpy)  2  Ru(dppz)]Cl  2  , tbbpy = 4,4&#180;&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz = dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine), instead, initiated the cofactor oxidation by electron transfer from NAD(P)H enabled by supramolecular binding between substrate and catalyst. Expulsion of the photoproduct NAD(P)  +  from the supramolecular binding site in  Rudppz  allowed very efficient turnover. Therefore,  Rudppz  permits repetitive selective assembly and oxidative conversion of reduced naturally occurring nicotinamides by recognizing the redox state of the cofactor under formation of H  2  O  2  as additional product. This photocatalytic process can fuel discontinuous photobiocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Study of the cycloaddition of CO2 with styrene oxide over 6&#8208;connected spn topology MOFs (Zr, Hf) at room temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a series of MOFs with a 6&#8208;connected spn topology (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(Zr, Hf), PCN&#8208;777&#8208;(Zr, Hf), MOF&#8208;818&#8208;(Zr, Hf)). Through the in&#8208;situ DRIFTS of NH  3  &#160;adsorption&#8208;desorption, we found that the activated catalyst mainly contains Lewis acid sites. The effects of different organic ligands on the Lewis acid of the Zr  6  &#160;cluster were analyzed by XPS and NH  3  &#8208;TPD, and the relative Lewis acidity of the same metal was obtained: PCN&#8208;777&gt;MOF&#8208;808&gt;MOF&#8208;818.&#160;In the Py&#8208;FTIR results, we confirmed that MOF&#8208;818 has a higher acid site density. In the activity test, MOFs with mesoporous structure showed better catalytic activity under normal temperature and pressure. Among them, MOF&#8208;818 can still maintain a high degree of crystallinity after catalysis. Finally, we use density functional theory to propose the mechanism of the cycloaddition reaction of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. The results show that the metal is coordinated with styrene oxide and halogens attack the &#946; carbon of the epoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named  1a  , is reported. Complex  1a  low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H  2  elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two&#8208;photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.</dc:description>

Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two-photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diphosphino&#8208;Functionalized 1,8&#8208;Naphthyridines: a Multifaceted Ligand Platform for Boranes and Diboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine diphosphine (NDP) reacts with boroncontaining Lewis acids to generate complexes featuring a number of different naphthyridine bonding modes. When exposed to diborane B  2  Br  4  , NDP underwent self&#8208;deprotonation to afford [NDP&#8208;B  2  Br  3  ]Br, an unsymmetrical diborane comprised of four fused rings. The reaction of two equivalents of monoborane BBr  3  and NDP in a non&#8208;polar solvent provided the simple phosphine&#8208;borane adduct NDP(BBr  3  )  2  , which then underwent intramolecular halide abstraction to furnish the salt [NDP&#8208;BBr  2  ][BBr  4  ], featuring a different coordination mode from that of [NDP&#8208;B  2  Br  3  ]Br. Direct deprotonation of NDP by KHMDS or PhCH  2  K generates mono&#8208; and dipotassium reagents, respectively. The monopotassium reagent reacts with one or half an equivalent of B  2  (NMe  2  )  2  Cl  2  to afford NDP&#8208;based diboranes with three or four amino substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Inner Workings of Naturally Sourced Organic Optoelectronic Materials with Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in sustainable optoelectronics including photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, transistors, and semiconductors have been enabled by &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules. A fundamental understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions involving these materials can be realized by time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies. In this Minireview, the photoinduced mechanisms including charge/energy transfer, electronic (de)localization, and excited&#8208;state proton transfer are correlated with functional properties encompassing optical absorption, fluorescence quantum yield, conductivity, and photostability. Four naturally derived molecules (xylindein, dimethylxylindein, alizarin, indigo) with ultrafast spectral insights showcase efficient energy dissipation involving H&#8208;bonding networks and proton motions, which yield high photostability. Rational design principles derived from such investigations could increase the efficiency for light harvesting, triplet formation, and photosensitivity for improved and versatile optoelectronic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type Oxidation of Olefins to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron complex FePcF16 was recently shown to convert olefins into ketones in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of triethylsilane in ethanol at room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere. Herein, we describe an extensive mechanistic investigation for the conversion of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene into 2&#8208;acetylnaphthalene as model reaction. A variety of studies including deuterium&#8208; and 18O2&#8208;labeling experiments, ESI&#8208;MS, and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy have been performed to identify the intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle of the oxidation process. Finally, a detailed and well&#8208;supported reaction mechanism for the FePcF16&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type oxidation has been proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Patterns of Aryl&#8208;Group Substituted Silanediols and &#8208;triols from Alkoxy&#8208; and Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilanols typically show a high condensation tendency and only exist as stable isolable molecules under very specific steric and electronic conditions at the silicon atom. In the present work, various novel representatives of this class of compounds were synthesized by hydrolysis of alkoxy&#8208; or chlorosilanes. Phenyl, 1&#8209;naphthyl, and 9&#8209;phenanthrenyl substituents at the silicon atom were applied to systematically study the influence of the aromatic substituents on the structure and reactivity of the compounds. Chemical shifts in 29Si NMR spectroscopy in solution, correlated well with the expected electronic situation induced by the substitution pattern on the Si atom. 1H&#160;NMR studies allowed the detection of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the alkoxides and the chlorosilanes are dominated by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of the aromatic systems, which are substituted by strong hydrogen bonding interactions representing various structural motifs in the respective organosilanol structures.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bright near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (NIR&#8211;ECL) of Au  18  nanoclusters is reported herein. Spooling ECL and photoluminescence spectroscopy was utilized to track and link NIR emissions at 832 and 848 nm to three emissive species, Au  18  0  *, Au  18  1+  * and Au  18  2+  *, respectively, with a considerable high ECL efficiency of 5.5 relative to that of the gold standard Ru(bpy)  3  2+  /TPrA (with 5&#8208;6% reported ECL efficiency). The unprecedented high efficiency is owing to the overlapped oxidation potentials of Au  18  0  and tri&#8208;  n  &#8208;propylamine as a coreactant, exposed facets of Au  18  0  gold core, and electrocatalytic loops. These discoveries will further add a new member to the efficient NIR&#8208;ECL gold nanoclusters family and bring more potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Tuning Band Gaps of Cu2O and TiO2 to Form S&#8208;Scheme Hetero&#8208;Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous tuning of band gaps of Cu2O and TiO2 to form a S&#8208;Scheme hetero&#8208;photocatalyst was reported. Quantum dot Cu2O was aimed to make conduction band more negative while the introduction of Ti3+ was to make its absorption edge red shift to visible light region. Such a heterostructured photocatalyst has shown greatly improved activity and stability for visible light photodegradation of 4&#8208;chloro phenol.







Abstract
Photocatalytic Z or S scheme merits higher redox potentials and faster charge separation. However, heterostructure photocatalysts with band gaps of bulk materials often have a type&#8197;I band structure leading to poor photocatalytic activity. In view of this, we report simultaneous tuning of band gaps of Cu2O and TiO2, where quantum dot Cu2O nanoparticles were formed on doped TiO2 with Ti3+. The reduced size of Cu2O made its conduction band more negative, whereas the introduction of Ti3+ made the absorption edge red shift to the visible light region. The as&#8208;formed heterostructure enabled an S&#8208;Scheme mechanism with remarkable activity and stability for visible light photodegradation of 4&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP). The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts&#8217; activity demonstrated ca. 510&#8208;fold increase as compared to individual ones and a mechanical blend. The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts maintained over 80&#8201;% for 5&#8197;cycles and 2&#8197;months exposure to O2 did not decrease the degradation rate. ESR characterization and scavenger experiments proved the S&#8208;Scheme mechanism.

         <title>Structural Modulation on NiCo2S4Nanoarray by N Doping to Enhance 2e&#8208;ORR Selectivity for Photothermal AOPs and Zn&#8722;O2Batteries**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Zn&#8722;O2 batteries: A 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;active electrocatalyst was synthesized by loading N&#8208;doped NiCo2S4 nanoarray on filter paper derived carbon paper with two coordination complexes as precursors. The electrocatalyst also exhibits good photothermal properties. Under the heating of the photothermal effect, H2O2 produced by 2e&#8208;ORR is decomposed and releases .OH radicals, which can degrade antibiotics, pesticides, and phenol through advanced oxidation processes. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and Zn as anode, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery was constructed.







Abstract
As a H2O2 generator, a 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in the advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo2S4 towards the 2e&#8722; reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S2&#8722;. The result implies that this weakens the interaction between NiCo2S4 and OOH*, suppresses O&#8722;O bond breaking and enhances H2O2 selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H2O2 produced by the oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and releaseOH, which degrades organic pollutants through the advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over the traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe2+ free character. With Zn as anode and the electrocatalyst as cathode material, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery is assembled. It achieves electricity generation and photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process simultaneously.

         <title>Excited State Charge Separation in an Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Dimer &#8211; Effect of Photochemical Trans&#8208;Cis Isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited state charge transfer and charge separation events in a newly synthesized azobenzene bridged PDI&#8208;dimer are demonstrated. Photoconversion of trans to cis&#8208;isomer accelerated the photoevents to an appreciable level.







Abstract
Photoinduced charge transfer and separation events in a newly synthesized azobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide&#8208;dimer (PDI&#8208;dimer) are demonstrated. Trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis conversion (&#8764;50&#8201;% efficiency) from the initial trans PDI&#8208;dimer by 355&#8197;nm pulsed laser light, and its reversal, cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans, process by 435&#8197;nm laser light irradiation has been possible to accomplish. Efficient fluorescence quenching in the PDI&#8208;dimer, more so for the cis isomer was witnessed, and such quenching increased with increasing solvent polarity. DFT&#8208;calculated geometry and electronic structures helped in visualizing the charge transfer in the PDI&#8208;dimer in both isomeric forms, and also revealed certain degree of participation of the azobenzene entity in the charge transfer events. Femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies confirmed occurrence of both charge transfer followed by charge separation in the studied PDI&#8208;dimer in both trans and cis forms in polar solvents, and the evaluated time constants from Global target analysis revealed accelerated events in the cis PDI&#8208;dimer due to proximity effects. The present study offers key insights on the role of the azobenzene bridge, and the dimer geometry in governing the excited state charge transfer and separation in symmetrically linked PDI dimer.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture Enhanced by Pre&#8208;Adsorption of Water and Methanol in UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF trap: We successfully applied a recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling that allows to elucidate the influence of water on CO2 adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We show that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO2 adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. We explain the mechanism of increased CO2 adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.







Abstract
The rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from human activity is one of the greatest environmental problems facing our civilization today. Most technologies are not yet sufficiently developed to move existing infrastructure to cleaner alternatives. Therefore, techniques for capturing carbon dioxide from emission sources may play a key role at the moment. The structure of the UiO&#8208;66 material not only meets the requirement of high stability in contact with water vapor but through the water pre&#8208;adsorbed in the pores, the selectivity of carbon dioxide adsorption is increased. We successfully applied the recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling. It allowed to elucidate the influence of water on CO2 adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We showed that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO2 adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. Water plays a role of a mediator of adsorption, what is a general idea of improving affinity of adsorbate. On the basis of pre&#8208;adsorption of methanol as another polar solvent, we have shown that the adsorption sites play a key role here, and not, as previously thought, only the interaction between the solvent and quadrupole carbon dioxide. Overall, we explained the mechanism of increased CO2 adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.

         <title>Stepwise Stress&#8208;Induced Transformations of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedral Cluster&#8208;Based Assemblies: Where Conformational and Supramolecular Features Meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The understanding of multiple polymorphic phase transitions in molecular crystals is still in its infancy. With this in mind, single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were targeted at a polyhedral oxo cluster featuring phenyl rings in the outer sphere. Pressure evolution leads to a gradual relaxation of induced structural strains through stepwise conformational twisting of the phenyl rings with the reorganization of cooperative noncovalent interactions; this propagates the conformational isomerization. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak, J.&#8197;Lewi&#324;ski et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101732).

         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;doped SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles and various plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids are used to make ecoresorbable electrorheological fluids. The particles are arranged perpendicular to the electrodes to form rigid fibril structures. The type of oil affects the wettability, resulting in differences in electrorheological performance and sedimentation behavior. The biocompatible smart fluids provide better commercial potential with diminishing concerns of environmental issues. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;Lee et&#8197;al.

         <title>Isomerization of Functionalized Olefins by Using the Dinuclear Catalyst [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2: A Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It takes two: The isomerization activity of [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2 has been investigated both experimentally and by DFT calculations. The energy profiles for the catalyst activation, alternative dinuclear and mononuclear catalytic cycles, and catalyst deactivation are in good agreement with the experimental results. Evaluation of the kinetic stereoselectivities revealed that a substantial fraction of the product is formed via cooperative dinuclear pathways.







Abstract
In a combined experimental and computational study, the isomerization activity of the dinuclear palladium(I) complex [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2 towards allyl arenes, esters, amides, ethers, and alcohols has been investigated. The calculated energy profiles for catalyst activation for two alternative dinuclear and mononuclear catalytic cycles, and for catalyst deactivation are in good agreement with the experimental results. Comparison of experimentally observed E/Z ratios at incomplete conversion with calculated kinetic selectivities revealed that a substantial amount of product must form via the dinuclear pathway, in which the isomerization is promoted cooperatively by two palladium centers. The dissociation barrier towards mononuclear Pd species is relatively high, and once the catalyst enters the energetically more favorable mononuclear pathway, only a low barrier has to be overcome towards irreversible deactivation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mirror symmetry breaking in systems composed of achiral molecules is of importance for the design of functional materials for technological applications as well as for the understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous emergence of chirality. Herein, we report the design and molecular self&#8208;assembly of two series of rod&#8208;like achiral polycatenar molecules derived from a &#960;&#8208;conjugated 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene core with a fork&#8208;like triple alkoxylated end and a variable single alkylthio chain at the other end. In both series of liquid crystalline materials, differing in the chain length at the trialkoxylated end, helical self&#8208;assembly of the  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated rods in networks occurs, leading to wide temperature range (&gt; 200 K) of bicontinuous cubic network phases, in some cases being stable even around ambient temperatures. The achiral bicontinuous cubic  I  a3  d  phase (gyroid) is replaced upon alkylthio chain elongation by a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken bicontinuous cubic phase (  I  23) and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso  1  [  *  ]  ). Further chain elongation results in removing the  I  23 phase and the re&#8208;appearance of the  Ia3  d  phase with &#160;different pitch lengths. In the second series an additional tetragonal phase separates the two cubic phase types.</dc:description>

         <title>The E2 state of FeMoco: hydride formation vs. Fe reduction and a mechanism for H2 evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is responsible for dinitrogen reduction in Mo nitrogenase. Unlike the resting state, E0, reduced states of FeMoco are much less well characterized. The E2 state has been proposed to contain a hydride but direct spectroscopic evidence is still lacking. The E2 state can, however, relax back the E0 state via a H2 side&#8208;reaction, implying a hydride intermediate prior to H2 formation. This E2&#8594;E0 pathway is one of the primary mechanisms for H2 formation under low&#8208;electron flux conditions.
In this study we present an exploration of the energy surface of the E2 state. Utilizing both cluster&#8208;continuum and QM/MM calculations, we explore various classes of models: including terminal hydrides, bridging hydrides with a closed or open sulfide&#8208;bridge, as well as models without. Importantly, we find the hemilability of a protonated belt&#8208;sulfide to strongly influence the stability of hydrides. Surprisingly, non&#8208;hydride models are found to be almost equally favorable as hydride models. While the cluster&#8208;continuum calculations suggest multiple possibilities, QM/MM suggest only two models as contenders for the E2 state. These models feature either i) a bridging hydride between Fe2 and Fe6 and an open sulfide&#8208;bridge (terminal SH on Fe6) (E2&#8208;hyd) or ii) a double belt&#8208;sulfide protonated, reduced cofactor without a hydride (E2&#8208;nonhyd). We suggest both models as contenders for the E2 redox state and further calculate a mechanism for H2 evolution. The changes in electronic structure of FeMoco during the proposed redox&#8208;state cycle, E0&#8594;E1&#8594; E2&#8594; E0, are discussed.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is responsible for dinitrogen reduction in Mo nitrogenase. Unlike the resting state, E0, reduced states of FeMoco are much less well characterized. The E2 state has been proposed to contain a hydride but direct spectroscopic evidence is still lacking. The E2 state can, however, relax back the E0 state via a H2 side-reaction, implying a hydride intermediate prior to H2 formation. This E2&#8594;E0 pathway is one of the primary mechanisms for H2 formation under low-electron flux conditions.
In this study we present an exploration of the energy surface of the E2 state.

         <title>Structural and Photophysical Characterization of All Five Constitutional Isomers of the Octaethyl&#8208;&#946;,&#946;'&#8208;dioxo&#8208;bacterio&#8208; and &#8208;isobacteriochlorin Series</title>

         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that treatment of &#946;&#8208;octaethylporphyrin with H  2  O  2  /conc. H  2  SO  4  converts it to a &#946;&#8208;oxochlorin as well as all five constitutional isomers of the corresponding &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;derivatives: two bacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo groups at opposite pyrrolic building blocks) and three isobacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;groups at adjacent pyrrolic building blocks). By virtue of the presence of the strongly electronically coupled &#946;&#8208;oxo auxochromes, none of the chromophores are archetypical chlorins, bacteriochlorins, or isobacteriochlorins. We firstly present here, inter alia, the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of all free&#8208;base diketone isomers and a comparative description of their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, and fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen photosensitization properties, Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra, and singlet excited state lifetimes. DFT computations uncover underlying tautomeric equilibria and electronic interactions controlling their electronic properties, adding to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying &#946;&#8208;oxo functionalities. This comparative study lays the basis for their further study and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes as mimics of amide derivatives or phosphates: a comprehensive review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem  &#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes have received little attention despite their great potential in medicinal chemistry or in fine chemistry. Indeed, due to the electronic and steric similarity between fluoroalkene moiety and amide bond as well as the high strength of carbon&#8208;fluorine bond, these  gem  &#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as stable mimics of various important organic functions such as phosphates, carbamates, S&#8208;thiocarbamates and ureas. We present herein an overview describing the syntheses over the last decade of heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes in geminal position. This review will be divided into several sections covering each the common following heteroatom: Oxygen&#8208;, Nitrogen&#8208;, Sulfur&#8208;, Phosphorus&#8208;, Boron&#8208; and Silicon&#8208; substituted fluoroalkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Dependent Dissolution of Non&#8208;Cubic Au Crystallites in Aqua Regia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Properties of metal crystallites are governed by their morphologies and inherent crystal structures. In this work, bipyramidal Au microcrystallites hosting non&#8208;cubic lattices, body&#8208;centered orthorhombic and tetragonal (together termed as bc(o,t)), are investigated for their stability in aqua regia. Specifically, microcrystallites comprising 92% of bc(o,t) have been subjected to aqua regia of different concentrations and the changes in morphology and lattice phases have been monitored using scanning electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The dissolution process was found to be crystal structure dependent and begin at the bipyramidal tips enriched with fcc lattice while retaining the bc(o,t) rich body. Interestingly, with increasing the reaction times, the remaining core was found to be highly reluctant to dissolution and instead, transformed to tetragonal lattices which with increasing treatment, exhibited lattice parameters closer to that of fcc. The study reveals the presence of a bc(o,t)&#8208;fcc core&#8208;shell structure with the tips enriched with fcc.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Enhanced Photochromic Property of Diarylethene Through Host&#8208;Guest Interaction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene (DTE) has been widely used in fluorescence probes, molecular logic gates, optical data&#8208;storage devices owing to the excellent photochromic property, while constructing high&#8208;performance photochromic DTE in aqueous media remains a big challenge. Herein we present several host&#8208;guest systems formed between cucurbit[  n  ]uril (CB[  n  ],  n  = 7, 8, 10) and two water&#8208;soluble DTE derivatives  1  and  2  . It was found that host&#8208;guest interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of photochromic guests, also make great differences on the photoreaction process. Different host&#8208;guest binding behaviors also lead to different effects on the photochromic properties of guests. In the presence of CB[  n  ], both  1  and  2  showed enhanced emission and higher fluorescence quenching ratio at photostationary state. Besides, CB[10]&#8226;  1  exhibited faster response rate in cyclization reaction and better photofatigue resistance than free  1  in aqueous solution, while the supramolecular assembly of (CB[8])  n  &#8226;(  2  )  n  showed slower response rate in both directions of the reversible photoreaction. Besides, the photofatigue resistance of  2  can be greatly improved through binding with CB[7]. Our results suggest that host&#8208;guest interactions could be an efficient way to improve photochromic properties of DTE in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers are promising cathode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries. Therefore, the precise modulation by chemical structure and in&#8208;depth structure transform study of these cathodes are necessary. In this article, two model coordination polymer battery cathodes were designed to demonstrate the dynamic structure&#8208;performance relationship. We studied the electrochemical performance of two kinds of nickel&#8208;based coordination polymers, comprising a planar 2D cyanide bridged networks and a 3D cyanide bridged networks pillared by pyrazine molecules, respectively. The 2D coordination polymer showed serious voltage degradation with poor rate capability while 3D coordination polymer exhibited stable voltage output coupled with high rate at various current densities. The investigation revealed the underlining relationship of plateau voltage degradation and hydrolysis process of electrodes. It was reflected that the pyrazine pillar molecules in 3D coordination polymer could suppress the hydrolysis and lead to the in&#8208;situ formation of partial hydrolyzed structure with excellent electrochemical kinetics, which exhibited obvious smaller peak separation (27 mV compared with 149 mV) and hence almost two&#8208;fold increase in capacity retention (31.9% to 50.0%) and energy density retention (18.2% to 35.9%) at 10 A g  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Containing Carbadecaphyrins: Non&#8208;aromatic Expanded Porphyrins that Undergo Proton&#8208;Triggered Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of  meso  &#8208;unsubstituted expanded carbaporphyrins containing two carbazole moieties were prepared in high isolated yields (82 and 76%, respectively). The two macrocycles, namely  3  and  4  , differ with respect to their substitution at the carbazole N&#8208;atoms i.e. by H and  i  &#8208;Bu, respectively. As prepared in their free&#8208;base forms, macrocycles  3  and  4  adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformations and are best characterized as 40 &#960;&#8208;electron, non&#8208;aromatic species possessing a decaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) skeleton. Protonation of  3  with either trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or perchloric acid (HClO  4  ) produces a parallelogram&#8208;shaped structure. A similar structure is produced when N&#8208;functionalized system  4  is treated with TFA. In contrast, protonation of  4  with HClO  4  leads it to adopt a twisted M&#246;bius strip&#8208;like structure in the solid state, thus allowing access to three distinct conformational states as a function of the conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Synthesis by Photo&#8208;Wolff&#8208;Kischner Reaction of Sulfur Ylides and N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and room temperature photo&#8208;Wolff&#8211;Kischner reaction of sulfur ylides and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones has been developed for the first time to provide modular access to alkene synthesis. The high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope were demonstrated by more than 60 examples. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;olefinic stereochemistry in the products could be controlled with excellent stereoselectivity. A series of mechanistic studies support that the reaction should proceed through a radical&#8208;carbanion crossover pathway. PC=photoredox catalysis. SET=single&#8208;electron transfer.

         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with very small optical energy gaps have attracted much attention for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. Herein, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;  b  :5,6&#8208;  b  ']dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72 eV in the solid state. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of the D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecules as well as theoretical calculations of their electronic structures revealed an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic oligothiophene donors in the D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecules, which significantly enhances the backbone resonance and thus reduces the bond length alternation along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. Despite the very small optical energy gaps, the D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecules have low&#8208;lying frontier orbital energy levels that give rise to air&#8208;stable ambipolar carrier transport properties with hole and electron mobilities of up to 0.026 and 0.043 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  , respectively, in the field&#8208;effect transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosure of Ground&#8208;State Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius Aromaticity in the Radical Anion of [6]Helicene and Evidence for 4&#960; Periodic Aromatic Ring Currents in a Molecular &#8220;Metallic&#8221; M&#246;bius Strip</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology in chemistry: The consequences of M&#246;bius topology are explored in anionic radicals of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by DFT methods. A stable Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius minimum in the noose region of the [6]helicene radical anion, constituting smallest and historically oldest M&#246;bius aromatic cycle, is disclosed as well as a metallic M&#246;bius cyclacenide nanohoop exhibiting an unprecedented 4&#960;&#8208;periodic strong aromatic ring current and unusual stability, defying H&#252;ckel's rule.







Abstract
In 1966, Zimmerman proposed a type of M&#246;bius aromaticity that involves through&#8208;space electron delocalization; it has since been widely applied to explain reactivity in pericyclic reactions, but is considered to be limited to transition&#8208;state structures. Although the easily accessible hexahelicene radical anion has been known for more than half a century, it was overlooked that it exhibits a ground&#8208;state minimum and robust Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius aromaticity in its central noose&#8208;like opening, becoming, hence, the oldest existing M&#246;bius aromatic system and with smallest M&#246;bius cycle known. Despite its overall aromatic stabilization energy of 13.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (at B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G**), the radical also features a strong, globally induced paramagnetic ring current along its outer edge. Exclusive global paramagnetic currents can also be found in other fully delocalized radical anions of 4N+2 &#960;&#8208;electron aromatic polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons (PAH), thus questioning the established magnetic criterion of antiaromaticity. As an example of a PAH with nontrivial topology, we studied a novel M&#246;bius[16]cyclacene that has a non&#8208;orientable surface manifold and a stable closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state at several density functional theory levels. Its metallic monoanion radical (0.0095&#8197;eV band gap at HSE06/6&#8208;31G* level) is also wave&#8208;function stable and displays an unusual 4&#960;&#8208;periodic, magnetically induced ring current (reminiscent of the transformation behaviour of spinors under spatial rotation), thus indicating the existence of a new, H&#252;ckel&#8208;rule&#8208;evading type of aromaticity.

     alt="Disclosure of Ground-State Zimmerman-M&#246;bius Aromaticity in the Radical Anion of [6]Helicene and Evidence for 4&#960; Periodic Aromatic Ring Currents in a Molecular &#8220;Metallic&#8221; M&#246;bius Strip"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topology in chemistry&lt;/b&gt;: The consequences of M&#246;bius topology are explored in anionic radicals of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by DFT methods. A stable Zimmerman-M&#246;bius minimum in the noose region of the [6]helicene radical anion, constituting smallest and historically oldest M&#246;bius aromatic cycle, is disclosed as well as a metallic M&#246;bius cyclacenide nanohoop exhibiting an unprecedented 4&#960;-periodic strong aromatic ring current and unusual stability, defying H&#252;ckel's rule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, Zimmerman proposed a type of M&#246;bius aromaticity that involves through-space electron delocalization; it has since been widely applied to explain reactivity in pericyclic reactions, but is considered to be limited to transition-state structures. Although the easily accessible hexahelicene radical anion has been known for more than half a century, it was overlooked that it exhibits a ground-state minimum and robust Zimmerman-M&#246;bius aromaticity in its central noose-like opening, becoming, hence, the oldest existing M&#246;bius aromatic system and with smallest M&#246;bius cycle known. Despite its overall aromatic stabilization energy of 13.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at B3LYP/6-311+G**), the radical also features a strong, globally induced paramagnetic ring current along its outer edge. Exclusive global paramagnetic currents can also be found in other fully delocalized radical anions of 4&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;+2 &#960;-electron aromatic polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons (PAH), thus questioning the established magnetic criterion of antiaromaticity. As an example of a PAH with nontrivial topology, we studied a novel M&#246;bius[16]cyclacene that has a non-orientable surface manifold and a stable closed-shell singlet ground state at several density functional theory levels. Its metallic monoanion radical (0.0095&#8197;eV band gap at HSE06/6-31G* level) is also wave-function stable and displays an unusual 4&#960;-periodic, magnetically induced ring current (reminiscent of the transformation behaviour of spinors under spatial rotation), thus indicating the existence of a new, H&#252;ckel-rule-evading type of aromaticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions at Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8211;&#960; and pancake interactions in the design of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes is discussed.







Abstract
Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tunable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts (solvento complexes) do not catalyze effectively organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts in both homogenous and heterogenous catalysis. In this minireview, we discuss several relevant examples, based on X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, in which the hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds, as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8211;&#960; and pancake interactions, are used as a synthon in the decoration of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Illuminating Protein Phase Separation: Reviewing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission, Fluorescent Molecular Rotor and Solvatochromic Fluorophore Based Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining a light: We present a brief review on the progress of fluorescent probes to illuminate protein phase separation process. These probes were derived from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgen) probes, fluorescent molecular rotors, and solvatochromic fluorophores.







Abstract
Protein phase separation process involving protein unfolding, misfolding, condensation and aggregation etc. has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. The complexity in protein conformational transitions results in multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;species biochemical pathways upon protein phase separation. Recent progresses in designing novel fluorescent probes have unraveled the enriched details of phase separated proteins and provided mechanistic insights towards disease pathology. In this review, we summarized the design and characterizations of fluorescent probes that selectively illuminated proteins at different phase separated states with a focus on aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes, fluorescent molecular rotors, and solvatochromic fluorophores. Inspired by these pioneering works, a design blueprint was proposed to further develop fluorescent probes that can potentially shed light on the unresolved protein phase separated states in the future.

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;Zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: A Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand&#8208;exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket was probed by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. These results are particularly relevant in the context of understanding the kinetic lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Bartik, O. Reinaud et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.20102184).

Maybe diamonds aren&#8242;t forever: Cubic diamond (Fd
m) silicon has been the material driver for electronics from the onset. In that structure, however, it absorbs and emits light inefficiently and offers no compositional tunability of properties. Both issues have been addressed by creating bulk GeSi solid solutions under pressure that are recovered in a different cubic structure (la
). This structure now transforms to a tunable hexagonal one that may not suffer from silicon's deficiencies.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;anvil and laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil methods have been used to subject Ge and Si mixtures to pressures and temperatures of between 12 and 17&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8211;1800&#8197;K, respectively. Synchrotron angle dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy, reveal recovery at ambient pressure of hexagonal Ge&#8722;Si solid solutions (P63/mmc). Taken together, the multi&#8208;anvil and diamond anvil results reveal that hexagonal solid solutions can be prepared for all Ge&#8722;Si compositions. This hexagonal class of solid solutions constitutes a significant expansion of the bulk Ge&#8722;Si solid solution family, and is of interest for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial distance has a major impact on the photoswitching in NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids. By careful molecular design and using MD simulations it was possible to gain valuable insight into the mechanism underlying these unique photoswitches.







Abstract
With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back&#8208;reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C60. In this work, the fundamental processes within these hybrids has been investigated. Variation of the linker unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction, two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids having a long&#8208;rigid and a short&#8208;rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC&#8211;C60 distance of up to 14.2&#8197;&#197;. By comparing the NBD&#8211;QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back&#8208;reaction.

     alt="Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spatial distance&lt;/b&gt; has a major impact on the photoswitching in NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids. By careful molecular design and using MD simulations it was possible to gain valuable insight into the mechanism underlying these unique photoswitches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back-reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. In this work, the fundamental processes within these hybrids has been investigated. Variation of the linker unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction, two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids having a long-rigid and a short-rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; distance of up to 14.2&#8197;&#197;. By comparing the NBD&#8211;QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back-reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Isolable Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanone and Its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone [IPrN]  2  Ge=O (IPrN = bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. The germanone has a rather high thermal stability in arene solvent, and no detectable change was observed at 80&#160;  o  C for at least one week. However, high thermal stability of [IPrN]  2  Ge=O does not prevent its reactivity toward small molecules. Structural analysis and initial reactivity studies revealed the highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Besides, the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide make it a mimic of nucleophilic transition&#8208;metal oxides. Mechanism for O&#8208;atom transfer reaction was investigated via DFT calculations, which revealed that the reaction proceeds via a [2+2] cycloaddition intermediate.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our role models and mentors are very important in our personal and professional development. However, in most cases, we do not spend enough time or pay enough attention choosing them. Herein, I explain how to select our role models and mentors, what characteristics they should have, and how to get the most out of them. Finally, I comment on the advantages of volunteering in an international scientific organization where you will find people with similar interests with whom to grow with purpose.







Abstract
Choosing the right mentors and role models has a profound impact in both our lives and professional careers; however, most often, not enough time or thought is given to this important decision. Because of that, we may miss some great opportunities and limit the potential benefits. In this invited contribution, I share my personal experience on nurturing the relationship with mentors and on choosing role models with my same values and a strong sense of service.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Spectrum of the First Excited State of Au2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au2+ cation: The high&#8208;resolution near&#8208;infrared spectrum of the lowest excited electronic state of this simple diatomic cation recorded by Ar&#8208;tagging photodissociation exhibits a surprisingly simple vibronic structure. Analysis by standard TD&#8208;DFT calculations provides the first spectroscopic information about the chemical bond in Au2+ in both the ground and excited electronic states.







Abstract
Au2+ is a simple but crucial model system for understanding the diverse catalytic activity of gold. While the Au2+ ground state (X2&#931;g+) is understood reasonably well from mass spectrometry and computations, no spectroscopic information is available for its first excited state (A2&#931;u+). Herein, we present the vibrationally resolved electronic spectrum of this state for cold Ar&#8208;tagged Au2+ cations. This exceptionally low&#8208;lying and well isolated A2&#931;(u)+&#8592;X2&#931;(g)+ transition occurs in the near&#8208;infrared range. The observed band origin (5738&#8197;cm&#8722;1, 1742.9&#8197;nm, 0.711&#8197;eV) and harmonic Au&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Ar stretch frequencies (201 and 133&#8197;cm&#8722;1) agree surprisingly well with those predicted by standard time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. The linearly bonded Ar tag has little impact on either the geometric or electronic structure of Au2+, because the Au2+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ar bond (&#8764;0.4&#8197;eV) is much weaker than the Au&#8722;Au bond (&#8764;2&#8197;eV). As a result of 6&#8197;s&#8592;5d excitation of an electron from the antibonding &#963;u* orbital (HOMO&#8208;1) into the bonding &#963;g orbital (SOMO), the Au&#8722;Au bond contracts substantially (by 0.1&#160;&#197;).

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Induced Phospholipase A2 Inhibition: A Major Role for Interfacial Tryptophan Dioxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We showed that singlet oxygen produced from cold physical plasma efficiently inactivated the PLA2 enzyme. Experimental and computational analysis proved that the dioxidation of interfacial tryptophan residue to N&#8208;formylkynurenine led to the decay of appropriate interactions between the enzyme and phospholipid, which prevented the enzyme attachment to the membrane consequently inhibited the enzyme efficiently.







Abstract
Several studies have revealed that various diseases such as cancer have been associated with elevated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. Therefore, the regulation of PLA2 catalytic activity is undoubtedly vital. In this study, effective inactivation of PLA2 due to reactive species produced from cold physical plasma as a source to model oxidative stress is reported. We found singlet oxygen to be the most relevant active agent in PLA2 inhibition. A more detailed analysis of the plasma&#8208;treated PLA2 identified tryptophan 128 as a hot spot, rich in double oxidation. The significant dioxidation of this interfacial tryptophan resulted in an N&#8208;formylkynurenine product via the oxidative opening of the tryptophan indole ring. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the efficient interactions between the tryptophan residue and phospholipids are eliminated following tryptophan dioxidation. As interfacial tryptophan residues are predominantly involved in the attaching of membrane enzymes to the bilayers, tryptophan dioxidation and indole ring opening leads to the loss of essential interactions for enzyme binding and, consequently, enzyme inactivation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diastereoselective double C&#8208;H heteroarylation of chiral ferrocenes provides valuable compounds with multiple functionalities using mild reaction conditions and simple reagents. Pd&#8208;Complexes with chiral mono&#8208;protected amino acids afforded corresponding heteroarylated ferrocenyl amines in good yields and high diastereomeric purities. In this way, a variety of indole, thiophene, pyrrole, or furan substituents were introduced to the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, a range of relevant functional groups, e.g. ketone, ester, chloro, nitro, silyl, are tolerated by this method. An alternative combination of amino acid and ferrocenyl amine configurations was leveraged to provide the complementary diastereomeric products. The products of C&#8208;H heteroarylation can be transformed into corresponding phosphines. Absolute configurations of CH&#8208;activation products were confirmed by the combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and CD spectroscopy.  19  F NMR kinetic study and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons governing stereoinduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochromic Luminescence (MCL) of Purely Organic Two&#8208;Component Dyes: Wide&#8208;Range MCL over 300&#8197;nm and Two&#8208;Step MCL by Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation</title>

         <dc:description>
Two components, two steps: Control over the mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of a dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine was achieved using a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach. Wide&#8208;range MCL with a solid&#8208;state emission wavelength shift of 340&#8197;nm and two&#8208;step MCL that can respond to mechanical stimuli of different intensity were realized for two&#8208;component mixtures composed of this diamine and a variety of non&#8208;MCL acceptor dyes.







Abstract
Despite recent extensive studies on mechanochromic luminescence (MCL), rational control over the magnitude of the emission&#8208;wavelength shift in response to mechanical stimuli remains challenging. In the present study, a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach has been applied to create a variety of organic MCL composites that exhibit remarkable emission&#8208;wavelength switching. Dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine and typical organic fluorophores have been employed as donor and acceptor dyes, respectively. Outstanding wide&#8208;range MCL with an emission&#8208;wavelength shift of over 300&#8197;nm has been achieved by mixing the diamine with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Unprecedented two&#8208;step MCL in response to mechanical stimuli of different intensity has also been realized for a two&#8208;component mixture with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. Fluorescence microscopy observations at the single&#8208;particle level revealed that the segregation and mixing of the two&#8208;component dyes contribute to the stimuli&#8208;responsive emission&#8208;color switching of the MCL composites.

         <title>Towards an Understanding of the Molecular Mechanisms of Variable Unnatural Base&#8208;Pair Behavior: A Biophysical Analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

An interdisciplinary study: The (d)NaM:(d)TPT3 unnatural base pair (UBP) can be replicated, transcribed, and translated in an organism, but its sequence context and orientation affects the fidelity and efficiency of these processes. We determined how this UBP affects nucleic acid duplexes, which provides mechanisms for variable behavior and can inform future UBP development.







Abstract
The series of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) developed by the Romesberg lab, which pair via hydrophobic and packing interactions have been replicated, transcribed, and translated inside of a living organism. However, as to why these UBPs exhibit variable fidelity and efficiency when used in different contexts is not clear. In an effort to gain some insights, we investigated the thermal stability and pairing selectivity of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP in 11nt duplexes via UV spectroscopy and the effects on helical structure via CD spectroscopy. We observed that while the duplexes containing a UBP are less stable than fully natural duplexes, they are generally more stable than duplexes containing natural mispairs. This work provides the first insights connecting the thermal stability of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP to the molecular mechanisms for varying replication fidelity in different sequence contexts in DNA, asymmetrical transcription fidelity, and codon:anticodon interactions and can assist in future UBP development.

         <title>Stepwise increase NdIII&#8208;based phosphorescence by AIE&#8208;active sensitizer: Broaden AIPE family from transition metals to discrete NIR lanthanide complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed two near&#8208;infrared lanthanide complexes [(  L  )  2  &#8208;Nd(NO  3  )  3  ] (  L  = TPE  2  &#8208;BPY for  1  , TPE&#8208;BPY for  2  ) by employing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives as sensitizers, which possessed matched energy to Nd  III  , effectively preventing competitive deactivation under aggregation, even shifting the excitation window toward 600 nm by twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Furthermore, benefiting from the 4  f  electron shielding effect and antenna effect, the enhanced excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers by structural rigidification transferred into the inert Nd  III  excited state through  3  LMCT, affording the first aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes. As  1  equipped with more AIE&#8208;active TPE than  2  ,  L  &#8594;Nd energy transfer efficiency of the former was larger than that of the latter under the same conditions. Moreover, the crystal of  1  exhibited one of the longest lifetimes (9.69  &#956;  s) among Nd  III  &#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Umbelliferone Decorated Water&#8208;soluble Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines &#8211; In Vitro Phototoxic Antimicrobial Anti&#8208;cancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented here are umbelliferone substituted water&#8208;soluble zinc(II)&#160;phthalocyanines, which are able to inactivate efficiently Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and are also active against HepG2 cancer cells. The compounds were investigated concerning their phototoxicity as well as their photophysical properties and their aggregation behavior.







Abstract
In this contribution we report on the synthesis, characterization and application of water&#8208;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines, which are decorated with four or eight umbelliferone moieties for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds are linked peripherally to zinc(II) phthalocyanine by a triethylene glycol linker attached to pyridines, leading to cationic pyridinium units, able to increase the water solubility of the system. Beside their photophysical properties they were analyzed concerning their cellular distribution in human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells as well as their phototoxicity towards HepG2 cells, Gram&#8208;positive (S. aureus strain 3150/12 and B. subtilis strain DB104) and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria (E. coli strain UTI89 and E. coli strain Nissle 1917). At low light doses and concentrations, they exhibit superb antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria as well as anti&#8208;tumor activity against HepG2. They are even capable to inactivate Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the dark toxicity remains low. These unique water&#8208;soluble compounds can be regarded as all&#8208;in&#8208;one type photosensitizers with broad applications ranges in the future.

         <title>Group 15 and 16 Nitrene&#8208;Like Pnictinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet&#8208;triplet gap energies are computed for simple pnictinidene moieties to offer theoretical insights and motivate future work on heavier pnictogen containing species.







Abstract
Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST=ESinglet&#8722;ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8722;R; Pn=P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8722;PH2 (&#8722;3.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and P&#8722;NH2 (&#8722;0.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8722;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photodriven Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Erosion of corrosion: TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies have been designed by a facile controllable calcination approach. They exhibit efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater owing to a unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption; which contribute to excellent activity and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting. This study could provide a promising strategy for the design of efficient semiconductors in marine applications.







Abstract
Photodriven seawater splitting is considered to be one of the most promising techniques for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high salinity of seawater would deactivate catalysts and consume the photogenerated carriers. Metal vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors are critical to directed electron transfer and high salinity resistance; they are thus desirable but remain a challenge. We demonstrate a facile controllable calcination approach to synthesize TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies with excellent photo/electro performances and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting, including photocatalysis and photo&#8208;electrocatalysis. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of titanium vacancies, as well as unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption ability for efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater. Therefore, atomic&#8208;/nanoscale characteristics and mechanism have been proposed to clarify the generation of titanium vacancies and the corresponding interfacial electron transfer.

         <title>Application of Multinuclear MAS NMR for the in&#8197;situ Monitoring of Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of in&#8197;situ multinuclear MAS NMR spectroscopy for monitoring hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites is demonstrated in the Review. The technique enables the detection of intermediate species stable only under hydrothermal conditions, provides information on the kinetics of synthesis and gives insight into the mechanism of gel formation, gel aging, crystal nucleation and growth.







Abstract
In situ MAS NMR studies on the monitoring of hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites are reviewed. The first part of the review contains information on the experimental techniques used for the in&#8197;situ NMR studies in static and MAS conditions. In the second part, the main capabilities of the in&#8197;situ 1H, 11B, 13C, 14N, 19F, 23Na, 27Al, 29Si and 31P MAS NMR for the elucidation of the mechanism of hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites are examined and the data on NMR lines identification are summarized. In the last part the main application areas of the techniques are considered and illustrated with examples taken from the mechanistic studies of zeolites A, X, MFI and BEA synthesis. A cross&#8208;reference index between the materials studied, the experimental approaches used, the mechanistic information obtained, and the corresponding literature sources is established.

In the second part, the main capabilities of the in&#8197;situ &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na, &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al, &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P MAS NMR for the elucidation of the mechanism of hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites are examined and the data on NMR lines identification are summarized. In the last part the main application areas of the techniques are considered and illustrated with examples taken from the mechanistic studies of zeolites A, X, MFI and BEA synthesis. A cross-reference index between the materials studied, the experimental approaches used, the mechanistic information obtained, and the corresponding literature sources is established.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Germanylidene Anions: Efficient Single&#8208;Site Nucleophiles for Activation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise reduction of germylenes via stable and isolable germanium radicals yields germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands. The anions contain a highly electron&#8208;rich germanium centre with significant ylidone character and are efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles that react even with weak electrophiles.







Abstract
Rare mononuclear and helical chain low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands were synthesised by stepwise reduction from corresponding germylene precursors via stable and isolable germanium radicals. The electronic structures of the anions can be described with ylidene and ylidone resonance forms with the Ge&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;electrons capable of binding even weak electrophiles. The germanylidene anions reacted with CO2 to give &#956;&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O complexes, a rare coordination mode for low&#8208;valent germanium and inaccessible for the related neutral germylones. These results implicate low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions as efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles for activation of small molecules.

         <title>Selective One&#8208;Pot Syntheses of Mixed Silicon&#8208;Germanium Heteroadamantane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward novel nanoclusters: The fourfold SiCl3&#8208;substituted Si4Ge6 ([0]), Si5Ge5 ([1]), and Si6Ge4 ([2]) heteroadamantane cores are accessible directly from Me2GeCl2 and Si2Cl6/Cl&#8722; in a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient synthesis. In a chloride ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement, [2] is converted into [1] at room temperature and into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
SixGey alloys are emerging materials for modern semiconductor technology. Well&#8208;defined model systems of the bulk structures aid in understanding their intrinsic characteristics. Three such model clusters have now been realized in the form of the SixGey heteroadamantanes [0], [1], and [2] through selective one&#8208;pot syntheses starting from Me2GeCl2, Si2Cl6, and [nBu4N]Cl. Compound [0] contains six GeMe2 and four SiSiCl3 vertices, whereas one and two of the GeMe2 groups are replaced by SiCl2 moieties in compounds [1] and [2], respectively. Chloride&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement quantitatively converts [2] into [1] at room temperature and finally into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is not only remarkable in view of the rigidity of these cage structures but also sheds light on the assembly mechanism.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Multiple Dimensional Assemblies from Tryptophan&#8208;Based Racemate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every dimension: Tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM) could assemble into 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers in ethanol/toluene, ethanol/H2O and ethanol/cyclohexane co&#8208;solvents (v:v=1&#8201;:&#8201;9), respectively. The uniform 0D nanospheres formed in ethanol/H2O under 4&#8201;&#176;C were able to convert into lamella spontaneously under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of the temperature&#8208;responsive morphological transformation, RPWM exhibited extremely high removal ability toward organic dye molecules and also possessed good reusability.







Abstract
Fabricating structural complex assemblies from simple amino acid&#8208;based derivatives is attracting great research interests due to their easy accessibility and preparation. However, the morphological regulation of racemates (an equimolar mixture of enantiomers) were largely overlooked. In this work, through rational modulation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, we achieved multiple dimensional architectures employing tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM). Upon assembling, 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers could be obtained depending on the solvents used. The corresponding morphology evolutions were successfully illustrated by changing the enantiomeric excess (ee) value. Moreover, for RPWM, uniform 0D nanospheres were formed in H2O under 4&#8201;&#176;C, which could spontaneously convert into lamella under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of its temperature&#8208;responsive phase change behavior, RPWM assemblies exhibited excellent removal efficiency for organic dye RhB, and could be reused for several consecutive cycles without significant changes in its removal performance. Taken together, it's rational to envision that the engineering of racemates assembly pathways can greatly increase the robustness in a wide variety of supramolecular materials and further lead to their blooming versatile applications.

         <title>Iron Binding in the Ferroxidase Site of Human Mitochondrial Ferritin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human mitochondrial ferritin (hMTF) performs its ferroxidase activity by oxidizing Fe(II) to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. Here, we performed kinetic measurements and time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis, providing the first structural evidence of iron ions binding to the ferroxidase site of hMTF and of the transient iron binding sites occuring from the entry channel to the catalytic center.







Abstract
Ferritins are nanocage proteins that store iron ions in their central cavity as hydrated ferric oxide biominerals. In mammals, further the L (light) and H (heavy) chains constituting cytoplasmic maxi&#8208;ferritins, an additional type of ferritin has been identified, the mitochondrial ferritin (MTF). Human MTF (hMTF) is a functional homopolymeric H&#8208;like ferritin performing the ferroxidase activity in its ferroxidase site (FS), in which Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. To better investigate its ferroxidase properties, here we performed time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis of hMTF, providing structural evidence of how iron ions interact with hMTF and of their binding to the FS. Transient iron binding sites, populating the pathway along the cage from the iron entry channel to the catalytic center, were also identified. Furthermore, our kinetic data at variable iron loads indicate that the catalytic iron oxidation reaction occurs via a diferric peroxo intermediate followed by the formation of ferric&#8208;oxo species, with significant differences with respect to human H&#8208;type ferritin.

         <title>The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;center halogen bond modulates the reactivity of a halonium ion and is thereby applicable for controlling the halogenation of alkenes. Chelation, strain, steric hindrance, and electrostatic interactions influence the halonium release rate. Combined experimental and theoretical analysis of the reaction mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and is expected to provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I. P&#225;pai, N. Bowling, M. Erdelyi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102575).

         <title>Studies on the application of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction to the synthesis of novel fluorinated scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of new scaffolds obtained by photochemical reactions, Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich alkenes to give oxetanes are described. A comprehensive study has then been carried out on the reaction of aromatic ketones with fluorinated alkenes. Depending on the substitution pattern at the oxetane ring, a metathesis reaction is described as a minor side process to give mono fluorinated alkenes. Overall, this last reaction corresponds to a photo&#8208;Wittig reactions and yield amid isosteres. In order to explain the uncommon regioselectivity of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with these alkenes, electrostatic&#8208;potential derived charges (ESP) have been determined. In a second computational study, the relative stabilities of the typical 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of the Patern&#242;B&#252;chi reaction have been determined. The results well explain the regioselectivity. Further transformations of the oxetanes or previous functionalization of the fluoroalkenes open perspectives for oxetanes as core structures for biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Li Plating and Stripping using Vertically Aligned Graphene/CNT Channels Decorated with ZnO Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal is regarded as an ultimate anode material for use in Li batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g&#8208;1). However, the Li dendrites that are generated during iterative Li plating/stripping cycles cause poor cycling stability and even create vital safety risks, and thus severely handicap the commercial utility of Li metal anodes. Herein, we describe a graphene&#8208; and carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based Li host material that features vertically aligned channels with attached ZnO particles (designated as ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) and show that the material effectively regulates Li plating and stripping. The ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C is prepared from an aqueous suspension of Zn(OAc)2, CNTs, and graphene oxide using ice to template channel growth. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C was found to be mechanically robust and capable of guiding Li deposition on the inner walls of the channels without the formation of Li dendrites. When used as an electrode, the material exhibits relatively low polarization for Li plating, fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and high Coulombic efficiency, even over hundreds of Li plating/stripping cycles. Moreover, full cells prepared using ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host and LiFePO4 as cathode exhibit outstanding performance in terms of specific capacity (155.9 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.5 C), rate performance (91.8 mA h g&#8208;1 at 4 C), cycling stability (109.4 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.5 C after 800 cycles). The methodology described can be readily adapted to enable the use of carbon&#8208;based electrodes with well&#8208;defined channels in a wide range of contemporary applications that pertain to energy storage and delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Trinuclear cyano&#8208;bridged [Cr2Fe] complexes: to be or not to be a SMM, a matter of straightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trinuclear systems of formula [{Cr(L  N3O2Ph  )(CN)  2  }  2  M(H  2  L  N3O2R  )] (M = Mn  II  and Fe  II  , L  N3O2R2  stands for pentadentate ligands) were prepared in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical M&#8208;N&#8801;C linkages on the magnetic anisotropy of the Fe  II  derivatives and in turn on their SMM behaviors. The cyanido&#8208;bridged [Cr  2  M] derivatives were obtained by assembling  trans  &#8208;dicyanido Cr  III  complex [Cr(L  N3O2Ph2  )(CN)  2  ]  &#8208;  and divalent pentagonal bipyramid complexes [M  II  (H  2  L  N3O2R2  )]  2+  with various R substituents (R = NH  2  , cyclohexyl,  S  ,  S  &#8208;mandelic) imparting different steric demand to the central moiety of the complexes. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8208;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the [Cr  2  Fe] complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects of the straightness of the apical C&#8208;N&#8208;Fe linkages on both the magnetic anisotropy of the Fe  II  center and the exchange interactions with the Cr  III  units.</dc:description>

         <title>Predictive catalysis in olefin metathesis with Ru&#8208;based catalysts with annulated C60 fullerenes in the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Predictive catalysis must be the tool that does not replace experiments, but acts as a selective agent, so that synthetic strategies of maximum profitability are used in the laboratory in a surgical way. Here, nanotechnology has been mixed with olefin metathesis from homogeneous Ru&#8208;NHC catalysts, specifically annulating a C  60  fullerene to the NHC ligand. Based on results with the C  60  in the backbone, a sterile change with respect to the catalysis of the metal center, an attempt has been made to bring C  60  closer to the metal, by attaching it to one of the two C&#8208;N bonds of the imidazole group of the SIMes (1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) ligand (reference NHC ligand of the 2  nd  generation Grubbs catalysts) to increase the steric pressure of C  60  in the first sphere of reactivity of the metal. The DFT calculated thermodynamics and the kinetics of SIMes&#8208;derived systems show that they are efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectral Signatures of Oxidation States in a Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures that allow discriminating among the oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;based water oxidation catalyst [(Mn  4  O  4  )(V  4  O  13  )(OAc)  3  ]  3  &#8722;  . Simulated IR spectra show that V=O stretching vibrations in the 900&#8211;1000cm  &#8722;  1  region shift consistently by about 20cm  &#8722;  1  per oxidation equivalent. Multiple bands in the 1450&#8211;1550cm  &#8722;  1  region also change systematically upon oxidation/reduction. The computed UV/Vis spectra predict that the spectral range above 350nm is characteristic of the managanese&#8208;oxo cubane oxidation state, whereas transitions at higher energy are due to the vanadate ligand. The presence of absorption signals above 680nm is indicative of the presence of Mn  III  atoms. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of the oxidation from [Mn  III  2  Mn  IV  2  ] to [Mn  IV  4  ] showed that the change in oxidation state can indeed be tracked by both IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

The computed UV/Vis spectra predict that the spectral range above 350nm is characteristic of the managanese-oxo cubane oxidation state, whereas transitions at higher energy are due to the vanadate ligand. The presence of absorption signals above 680nm is indicative of the presence of Mn  III  atoms. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of the oxidation from [Mn  III  2  Mn  IV  2  ] to [Mn  IV  4  ] showed that the change in oxidation state can indeed be tracked by both IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host&#8208;guest Complexation between Cyclodextrins and Hybrid Hexavanadates: What are the Driving Forces?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest complexes between native cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) and hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates (POVs) [V6O13((OCH2)3C&#8208;R)2]2&#8211;  with R=CH2CH3, NO2, CH2OH and NH(BOC) were studied in aqueous solution. 6 crystal structures determined by SCXRD analysis revealed the nature of the R group strongly influences the host&#8211;guest conformation. In all systems isolated in the solid&#8208;state, the organic groups R are embedded within the CD cavities, involving only a few weak supramolecular contacts. The interaction between hybrid POVs and the macrocyclic organic hosts have been studied in solution using ITC, cyclic voltammetry and NMR methods (1H NMR, and 2D DOSY, and ROESY). This set of complementary techniques provides clear insights about the strength of interactions and the binding host&#8208;guest modes occurring in aqueous solution, highlighting a dramatic influence of the functional group R on the supramolecular properties of the POV (association constant K1:1  vary from 0 to 2 000 M&#8208;1  ) while isolated functional organic groups exhibit only very weak intrinsic affinity with CDs. Electrochemical and calorimetric investigations suggest that the driving force of the host&#8208;guest association involving larger CDs (&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) is mainly related to the chaotropic effect. In contrast, the hydrophobic effect supported by weak attractive forces appears as the main contributor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;containing host&#8208;guest complexes. In any cases, the origin of driving forces is clearly related to the ability of the macrocyclic host to desolvate the exposed moieties of the POVs.</dc:description>

         <title>CdS Reinforced with CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH Core&#8208;shell Co&#8208;catalyst Demonstrate High Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Durability in Anhydrous Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, inefficient charge separation of single photocatalyst impedes the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, the CoS  X  /NiCo&#8208;LDH core&#8208;shell co&#8208;catalyst was cleverly designed, which exhibit high activity and high stability of hydrogen evolution in anhydrous ethanol system when coupled with CdS. Under visible light (&#955; &#8805; 420 nm) irradiation, the 3%Co/NiCo/CdS composite photocatalyst exhibits a surprisingly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 20.67 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , which is 59 times than that of the original CdS. Continuous light for 20 h still showed good cycle stability. In addition, the 3%Co/NiCo/CdS composite catalyst also shows good hydrogen evolution performance under the Na  2  S/Na  2  SO  3  and lactic acid system. The Fluorescence (PL), ultraviolet&#8208;visible diffuse reflectance (UV&#8208;vis) and photoelectrochemical tests show that the coupling of CdS and CoS  X  /NiCo&#8208;LDH not only accelerates the effective transfer of charges, but also greatly increases the absorption range of CdS to visible light. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution activity of the composite photocatalyst has been significantly improved. This work will provide new insights for the construction of new co&#8208;catalysts and the development of composite catalysts for hydrogen evolution in multiple systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcined ZnTi&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide Intercalated with H3PW12O40 with Efficiently Photocatalytic and Adsorption Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wastewater treatment is of great significance to environmental remediation. The exploration of efficient and stable methods for wastewater treatment is still a challenging issue. Herein, a heterojunction material with photocatalysis and adsorption properties has been designed to remove the complex pollutants from wastewater. The heterojunction material (ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12, PW12= [PW12O40]3&#8208;) was synthesized by calcining the ZnTi&#8208;layered double hydroxide (ZnTi&#8208;LDH) intercalated with the Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate H3PW12O40. In the construction of ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12, it was found that the polyanionic PW12  remained unchanged in the process of forming the proposed heterojunction. The photochemical properties verifies that heterojunction synergistic with PW12  facilitated the separation of photoproduced electron&#8208;hole pairs and thus suppressed the recombination. Therefore, ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12  exhibits excellent photocatalytic properties, and the efficiency of Cr(VI) photoreduction reached more than 90% in the first 3 min. Furthermore, the electrostatic force between the PW12  and cationic dyes makes ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12  have an outstanding adsorption performance for cationic dyes such as rhodamine B, crystal violet and methyl blue. Such the heterojunction material combined with polyoxometalate puts forwards new insights for the design of functional materials for water treatment with low cost and high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have seen a marked increase in the occurrence of sulfoximines in the chemical sciences, often presented as valuable motifs for medicinal chemistry. This has been prompted by both pioneering works taking sulfoximines containing compounds into clinical trials and the concurrent development of powerful synthetic methods. This review covers recent developments in the synthesis of sulfoximines concentrating on developments since 2015. This includes extensive developments in both S&#8208;N and S&#8208;C bond formations. Flow chemistry processes for sulfoximine synthesis are also covered. &#160;Finally, subsequent transformations of sulfoximines, particularly in N&#8208;functionalization are reviewed, including N&#8211;S, N&#8211;P, N&#8211;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence&#8208;Based Techniques for the Detection of Micro&#8208; and Nano&#8208;Plastics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing numbers related to plastic pollution are impressive, with ca. 70% of produced plastic (&gt; 350 tonnes/year) being indiscriminately wasted in the environment. The most dangerous forms of plastic pollution for biota and human health are micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;plastics (MNPs), which are ubiquitous and more bioavailable. Their elimination is extremely difficult, but the first challenge is their detection since existing protocols are unsatisfactory for microplastics and mostly absent for nanoplastics. After a discussion of the state of the art for MNPs detection, we specifically revise the techniques based on photoluminescence that represent very promising solutions for this problem. In this context, Nile Red staining is the most used strategy and we show here its pros and limitations, but we also discuss other more recent approaches, such as the use of fluorogenic probes based on perylene&#8208;bisimide and on fluorogenic hyaluronan nanogels, with the added values of biocompatibility and water solubility.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of red&#8208;shifted and fluorogenic nucleoside and oligonucleotide diarylethene photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversible modulation of fluorescence signals by light is of high interest for applications in super&#8208;resolution microscopy, especially on the DNA level. In this article we describe the systematic variation of the core structure in nucleoside&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs), in order to generate intrinsically fluorescent photochromes. The introduction of aromatic bridging units resulted in a bathochromic shift of the visible absorption maximum of the closed&#8208;ring form, but caused reduced thermal stability and switching efficiency. The replacement of the thiophene aryl unit by thiazol improved the thermal stability, whereas the introduction of a benzothiophene unit led to inherent and modulatable turn&#8208;off fluorescence. This feature was further optimized by introducing a fluorescent indole nucleobase into the DAE core, resulting in an effective photoswitch with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.0125 and a fluorescence turn&#8208;off factor of 3.2. The site&#8208;specific incorporation into an oligonucleotide resulted in fluorescence&#8208;switchable DNA with high cyclization quantum yields and switching efficiency, which may facilitate future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Linkage of BODIPY&#8208;Photosensitizers to Anderson&#8208;type Polyoxometalates using CLICK Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent attachment of molecular photosensitizers (PS) to polyoxometalates (POMs) opens new pathways to PS&#8208;POM dyads for light&#8208;driven charge&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;storage. Here we report a synthetic route for the covalent linkage of BODIPY&#8208;dyes to Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdates using CLICK chemistry (  i.e.  copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, CuAAC). Photophysical properties of the dyad were investigated by combined experimental and theoretical methods and highlight the role of both sub&#8208;components for the charge&#8208;separation properties. The study demonstrates how CLICK chemistry can be used for the versatile linkage of organic functional units to molecular metal oxide clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Stabilization of Blue&#8208;Emissive Anthracenes: Phenylene Bridging Works Best</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10&#8208;diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis&#8208; meta &#8208;terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10&#8208;biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; sky&#8208;blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time&#8208;resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Terpene Synthase Plasticity in Catalysis: On the Enzymatic Conversion of Synthetic Farnesyl Diphosphate Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four synthetic farnesyl diphosphate analogues were enzymatically converted with three bacterial sesquiterpene synthases, including &#946;&#8208;himachalene synthase (HcS) and (  Z  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;bisabolene synthase (BbS) from  Cryptosporangium arvum  , and germacrene A synthase (SmTS6) from  Streptomyces mobaraensis  . These enzyme reactions not only yielded several previously unknown compounds, showing that this approach opened the door to a new chemical space, but substrates with blocked or altered reactivities also gave interesting insights into the cyclisation mechanisms and the potential to catalyse reactions with different initial cyclisation modes.</dc:description>
