         <title>Selective Synthesis of 3D Aligned VO2 and V2O5 Carbon Nanotube Hybrid Materials by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>

Gas phase synthesis of vanadium oxides VO2 and V2O5 on vertically aligned 3D arrays of carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. A systematic investigation of temperature, precursor and reactor constraints towards the controlled synthesis of these composites is presented. Different text spacing!!







Abstract
3D carbon nanotube hybrid materials containing VO2 and V2O5 evenly distributed onto vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. Adjustable loading of particles in controllable sizes and shapes onto the VACNTs was developed via a stepwise chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach. Solid VO(acac)2 is chosen as vanadium source. CO2 acts as reactive gas for the pre&#8208;functionalisation of the VACNTs. The process temperature was identified as key parameter to control the deposited vanadium oxide phase. A temperature of 550&#8201;&#176;C results in monoclinic VO2, while 600&#8201;&#176;C results in the deposition of V2O5 onto the VACNT support. The morphology and the amount of deposited material was found to be dependent on the reactor dimensions and the degree of functionalisation of the carbon support. An increase of the D/G ratio of the VACNT from 0.75 to 1.08 caused by a CO2 treatment step within the process led to an increase of the particle coverage from a scarce coverage without prior CO2 treatment to a dense coverage of the VACNT support after 15&#8197;min of CO2 exposure time. Size and crystallinity of the as deposited particles can be further adjusted by a controlled heat treatment after VO(acac)2 precursor deposition.

         <title>Isonitrile Photochemistry: A Functional Group Class Coming in from the Cold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isonitriles, often neglected for their unpleasant smell, have fascinated many generations of chemists thanks to unique reactivity modes. The present concept article, by retracing the seeds of isonitrile photochemistry, points out the hidden opportunities offered by visible light photo(redox) catalysis to promote key advancements in the field.







Abstract
Starting from a historical background that acknowledges isonitriles as a neglected class of compounds due to their unpleasant smell and hardly controlled reaction conditions with open shell species, the present concept article aims at highlighting the seeds of the modern isonitrile photochemistry. Representative essential transformations achieved via either UV light irradiation or radical initiators at high temperatures are brought into play to draw a parallel with the current literature relying on the exploitation of visible light photochemical methods. Such a comparison points out the potential of this enabling technology to further expand the scope of isonitrile chemistry and the unmet challenges which makes it a very stimulating field.

         <title>High Yield of L&#8208;Sorbose via D&#8208;Glucose Isomerization in Ethanol over a Bifunctional Titanium&#8208;Boron&#8208;Beta Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional Ti&#8208;B&#8208;Beta zeolite is demonstrated to be an efficient catalyst for sorbose production via glucose isomerization. Ethanol directs the conformation of glucose, facilitating its selective isomerization to sorbose and enables this isomerization to surpass the thermodynamic equilibrium limit by engaging in reactions with the resultant sorbose.







Abstract
D&#8208;Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization on Lewis acidic zeolite is a highly attractive avenue for sorbose production. But the L&#8208;sorbose yield is limited by the competing D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;D&#8208;fructose isomerization and reaction equilibrium. In this work, it is suggested that ethanol directs the glucose conformation for selective D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization. It also reacts with the produced L&#8208;sorbose to form ethyl&#8208;sorboside, which allows the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization to proceed beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limit. It is shown that a bifunctional zeolite Beta containing framework titanium (Ti) and boron (B) is a selective catalyst for this tandem reaction: Lewis acidic framework Ti catalyzes the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization via an intramolecular 5,1&#8208;hydride shift process as confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments followed by 13C&#8208;NMR, while weak Br&#248;nsted acid framework B selectively promotes the sorbose ketalization with ethanol. A remarkably high yield of L&#8208;sorbose with a high fraction of sugar (&gt;95&#8201;%: 27&#8201;% unreacted glucose, 11.4&#8201;% fructose, 57&#8201;% sorbose) was obtained after the mixture produced in ethanol was hydrolyzed.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Attached (NHC)Gold(I) and (NHC)Copper(I) Complexes as Photoswitchable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;functionalized photoswitchable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, (IAz&#8208;OMe)AuCl and (IAz&#8208;OMe)CuCl, are synthesized and characterized. The extent of trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers are investigated. The percentage buried volumes of the cis&#8208;cis catalysts are found to be higher than the trans&#8208;trans isomers. Light&#8208;induced alteration and toggling of reaction rates in oxazoline formation and CuAAC reactions are studied.







Abstract
Photoswitchable (pre)catalysts, N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;based (NHC)gold(I) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;derived (NHC)copper(I) complexes are reported. Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8722;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8722;Au(I) and &#8722;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic study. Calculated percentage buried volumes of the three geometrical isomers show the trend trans&#8208;trans&lt;trans&#8208;cis&lt;cis&#8208;cis.

         <title>Dirhodium(II)/XantPhos Catalyzed Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;Vinylsilanes via Hydrosilylation and Isomerization from Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
Dirhodium (II) complexes play important roles in organic synthesis based on their unique lantern&#8208;type bimetallic structure. Herein, we report a simple and efficient Rh2(OAc)4/XantPhos catalyzed a stereoselective hydrosilylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies indicated that the formation of (Z)&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of alkyne proceeded via zwitterionic carbene species while (E)&#8208;selectivity was generated by the isomerization catalyzed by rhodium hydride species.







Abstract
A concise hydrosilylation of alkynes for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;vinylsilanes catalyzed by dirhodium(II)/XantPhos has been developed. In this reaction, &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;vinylsilanes were generated from the isomerization of &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes catalyzed by dirhodium(II) hydride species rather than the direct insertion of triple bond into M&#8722;H or M&#8722;Si bond (traditional Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism or modified Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism). The hydrosilylation displayed a broad substrate scope for alkynes and tertiary silanes, tolerating diverse functional groups including halides, nitriles, amines, esters, and heterocycles.

         <title>Rational Design of Mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunctions for Environmental Remediation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) comprising g&#8208;C3N4@ZnFe2O4, featuring tiny mesopores and effective heterojunctions, demonstrate superior catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and dye degradation under solar illumination, with recyclability and easy separation using magnets.







Abstract
Mesoporous catalysts with a high specific surface area, accessible pore structures, and appropriate band edges are desirable for optimal charge transfer across the interfaces, suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, and promote redox reactions at the active sites. The present study demonstrates the rational design of mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) with different pore sizes and pore volumes following a combination of facile thermal itching and thermal impregnation methods. The MNCs preserve the structural, morphological, and physical attributes of their counterparts while ensuring their effectiveness and superior catalytic capabilities. The morphological analysis confirms the successful grafting and confinement of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with the polymeric g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to form heterojunctions with numerous interfaces. The MNCs possess uniformly distributed small mesopores (pore size &lt;4&#8197;nm), ample active sites, and a high specific surface area of 62.50&#8197;m2/g. The mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 notably improve hydrogen evolution rate and methylene blue dye degradation. The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20&#8201;%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photo&#8208;Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147&#8197;min&#8722;1, upon solar&#8208;light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.

         <title>Counterion Exchange Enhances the Brightness and Photostability of a Fluorous Cyanine Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While useful tools for studying perfluorocarbons, fluorous soluble fluorophores (fluorofluorophores) are often less bright and prone to rapid photobleaching in the fluorous phase. Here, we utilized a counterion modification on a fluorous pentatmethine dye (FCy5) to promote favorable cyanine character, resulting in a brighter and more photostable fluorofluorophore.







Abstract
Fluorofluorophores are a unique class of fluorophores that can be solubilized in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and used to study biological systems. However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.

We report a new class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that are characterized by unique steric and electronic properties. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. We anticipate that this novel class of NHC ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers in the fields of organic and inorganic chemistry.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atom has attracted considerable interest in molecular design owing to the high electronegativity and the resulting polarization of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds. Simultaneously, sterically&#8208;hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to high stabilization of the reactive metal centers, which has paved the way for the synthesis of stable and reactive organometallic compounds with broad applications in main group chemistry, inorganic synthesis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis. Herein, we report the first class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These ligands feature variable fluorine substitution at the N&#8208;aromatic wingtip, permitting to rationally vary steric and electronic characteristics of the carbene center imparted by the fluorine atom. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. The evaluation of steric, electron&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties as well as coordination chemistry to Au(I), Rh(I) and Se is presented. Considering the unique properties of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds, we anticipate that this novel class of fluorinated carbene ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers.

Chirality at the metal center is a well&#8208;established concept, exemplified by numerous four&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinated complexes. Here, a pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is described: [Ag(NHC)2]+ (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). In solution, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions preserve the chiral information of the solid state. Consequently, a novel class of atropisomers is identified, whose stereogenicity arises from hindered rotation around a C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C axis, instead of a typical C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>Formation and Stability of Benzylic Amide [2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes: An Intercomponent Interactions Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synthesis and characterization of amide&#8208;benzylic [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes that include a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. The macrocycle preference for one station was evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The slight modifications in the thread structure impacted the stability and intercomponent interactions, guiding the selective formation of [2]&#8208; or [3]rotaxanes.







Abstract
One of the most recent focuses in supramolecular chemistry is developing molecules designed to exhibit programmable properties at the molecular level. Rotaxanes, which function as molecular machines with movements controlled by external stimuli, are prime candidates for this purpose. However, the controlled synthesis of rotaxanes, especially amide&#8208;benzylic rotaxanes with more than two components, remains an area ripe for exploration. In this study, we aim to elucidate the formation of amide&#8208;benzylic [3]rotaxanes using a thread that includes a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. Including the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station introduces new perspectives into the chemistry of rotaxanes, influencing their conformation and dynamics. The synthesis of two&#8208;station rotaxanes with varying stoppers demonstrated that the macrocycle consistently occupies the succinamide station, providing greater stability as evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The presence of a triazole&#8208;carbonyl station facilitated the formation of a second macrocycle exclusively when a secondary amide was employed as the stopper group, presumably due to decreased steric hindrance. Moreover, the second macrocycle directly forms at the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. This investigation reveals that slight modifications in the thread structure can dramatically impact the formation, stability, and interactions between components of rotaxanes.

         <title>Transient Photoactivation of Anionophores by Using Redshifted Fast&#8208;Relaxing Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing redshifted azobenzene&#8208;based anionophores in which the more active isomer is thermally unstable, pulsed ion transport activity could be achieved by using amber/red light to generate the active ionophore, and exploiting thermal relaxation to relax back to a deactivated state over time.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;regulated transmembrane ionophores enable spatial and temporal control over activity, offering promise as targeted therapeutics. Key to such applications is control using bio&#8208;compatible visible light. Herein, we report red&#8208;shifted azobenzene&#8208;derived synthetic anionophores that use amber or red light to trigger (E)&#8208;(Z) photoisomerisation and activation of transmembrane chloride transport. We demonstrate that by tuning the thermal half&#8208;life of the more active, but thermodynamically unstable, Z isomer to relax on the timescale of minutes, transient activation of ion transport can be achieved by activating solely with visible light and deactivating by thermal relaxation.

Fluorine considered as magic element strongly affects the chemical, physical and biological properties of molecules. Simultaneously, sterically hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to the high stabilization of the reactive metal centers. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402847), G. Utecht&#8208;Jarzy&#324;ska, M. Szostak and co&#8208;workers report a new class of fluorinated, sterically hindered NHCs characterized by unique steric and electronic properties. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access to fluorinated ligands for academic and industrial researchers.

Despite being an important class of compounds with broad applications in organic synthesis, isonitriles have often been neglected due to concerns about their unpleasant odor, stability, and toxicity. Recently, the potential to exploit their stereoelectronic properties in light&#8208;triggered synthetic methods leading to unique reactivity patterns has sparked renewed interest, allowing them to come in from the cold.

The stability and formation of [2]&#8208; or [3]rotaxanes are influenced by minor alterations in the thread structure. The Cover Feature depicts scientists observing the molecular structures, symbolizing the exploration of intercomponent interactions in rotaxane molecules. It has been found that introducing a second macrocycle slightly reduced the stabilization energy between the thread and the first macrocycle but significantly enhanced the overall stabilization energy of the [3]rotaxane. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Orlando and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403276).

A pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal: The concept of metal&#8208;centered chirality is no longer limited to octahedral, tetrahedral and square&#8208;planar geometries. Our design induces the formation of a stereogenic C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C axis as a consequence of atropisomerism. More importantly, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, both in solution and the solid state, are crucial in preserving the chiral information.

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing the merits of ordered and tailored channel structures in the burgeoning crystalline porous materials, have demonstrated significant promise in construction of high&#8208;performance separation membranes.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing the merits of ordered and tailored channel structures in the burgeoning crystalline porous materials, have demonstrated significant promise in construction of high&#8208;performance separation membranes. However, precisely because this crystal structure with strong molecular interaction in their lattice provides robust structural integrity and resistance to chemical and thermal degradation, crystalline MOFs typically exhibit insolubility, infusibility, stiffness and brittleness, and therefore their membrane&#8208;processing properties are far inferior to the flexible amorphous polymers and hinder their subsequent storage, transportation, and utilization. Hence, focusing on film&#8208;formation and crystallization is the foundation for exploring the fabrication and application of MOF membranes. In this review, the film&#8208;forming properties of crystalline MOFs are fundamentally analyzed from their inherent characteristics and compared with those of amorphous polymers, influencing factors of polycrystalline MOF membrane formation are summarized, the trade&#8208;off relationship between crystallization and membrane formation is discussed, and the strategy solving the film formation of crystalline MOFs in recent years are systematically reviewed, in anticipation of realizing the goal of preparing crystalline membranes with optimized processability and excellent performance.

         <title>Deciphering the Cell Surface Sugar&#8208;Coating via Biochemical Pathways</title>

Glycans have a significant role in cellular architecture, establishing cell communication and as disease biomarkers. In this work, glycan recognition is discussed using different methods, such as metabolic glycan labelling, boronic acid probes, etc. Selective recognition of glycans would open a future direction in glycan&#8208;specific target therapeutics and would be interesting for a broader readership in chemistry, biology and medicine.







Abstract
Cell surface components, specifically glycans, play a significant role in several biological functions like cell structure, crosstalk between cells, and eventual target recognition of the cells for therapeutics. The dense layer of glycans, i.&#8201;e., glycocalyx, could differ in taxon, species, and cell type. Glycans are coupled with lipids and proteins to form glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;anchored proteins, making their study challenging. However, understanding glycosylation at the cellular level is vital for fundamental research and advancing glycan&#8208;targeted therapy. Among different pathways, metabolic glycan labelling uses the natural metabolic processes of the cell to introduce abiotic functionality into glycan residues. The Bertozzi group pioneered metabolic oligosaccharide engineering using glycan salvage pathways to convert monosaccharides with unnatural modifications. This eventually results in the probe becoming part of the complex cellular glycan structures via click chemistry using copper. On the other hand, the boronic acid&#8208;based probe can recognise carbohydrates in a single step without any chemical modification of the surface. This review discusses the significance of glycans as biomarkers for different diseases and the necessity to evaluate them in&#8197;situ within the physiological environment. The review also discusses the prospect of this field and its potential applications.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Like Pentanuclear Complexes: Syntheses, Crystal Structures and Long&#8208;Range Electronic Interactions of Cyanido&#8208;Bridged M2Ru3 (M=Fe, Ru)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For both the pentanuclear complexes with the skeleton of [M&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;M] (M=Fe, 1; M=Ru, 2) reported in this work, a very strong electronic coupling exists between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN. Moreover, 1 exhibits no electronic coupling between the two terminal Fe. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits a long&#8208;range (20&#8197;&#197;) electronic coupling between the two terminal metal ions across the linear trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC bridge.







Abstract
In this work, we report the design and synthesis of two chain&#8208;like pentanuclear cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)2][cis&#8208;Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;NC)M(dppe)Cp*]2[PF6]4 (M=Fe, 14+; M=Ru, 24+) and the electronic communication properties of their oxidized products 1m+ (m=6, 7, 8) and 2n+ (n=5, 6, 7, 8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 1m+ (m=4, 6, 7) and 24+ show that 14+ and 24+ possess a Z&#8208;type array structure, 17+ is a U&#8208;type one, and 16+ exhibits both the types. The investigations indicate that both 1 and 2 show an extraordinarily strong electronic interaction between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN, leading to the formation of a fully delocalized cyanidometal Ru&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ru bridge for both three&#8208;electron oxidized states 17+ and 27+. Moreover, it should be noted that in 1 there exists no electronic interaction between the two terminal Fe ions. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits an electronic interaction between the two terminal metal ions across the trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC bridge which is up to 20&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with Efficient Charge Mobility and Separation Capabilities Studied by DFT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of heterojunction organic solar cells were designed using bacteriochlorin as a donor. They exhibit efficient charge mobility and separation rates, which provide theoretical guidance for constructing new low&#8208;cost and highly efficient BHJ organic solar cells.







Abstract
The properties of the active layer materials play a decisive role in determining the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Chlorophyll and its derivatives are abundant and environmentally friendly functional organic molecular materials. Using density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT), we have calculated the absorption spectra and their excited state properties based on optimized ground state structures. It was found that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior structural properties, a smaller energy gap and hole reorganization energy, redshifted absorption spectra, and higher hole mobility compared to the donor D18. This suggests that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior donor properties. Comparative studies between o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl showed that o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl had superior acceptor properties, implying that differences in substitution positions can influence the physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Subsequently, six bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) were constructed by combining three donors with nonfused ring electron acceptors, o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl. The bacteriochlorin&#8208;based BHJs performed well among them, with BChl3/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and BChl4/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl having the largest interfacial charge separation rate. The results suggested that BHJs composed of bacteriochlorin and NFAs can improve OSCs&#8217; photovoltaic performance, providing a feasible scheme for designing efficient OSCs.

         <title>Designing Artificial Laccase Catalysts by Introducing Substrate Oxidation Metals into Oxygen&#8208;Reducing Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Cu&#8208;Doped ZIF&#8208;67</title>

This study presents the development of copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67) as an artificial laccase catalyst. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits enhanced catalytic performance and thermal stability compared to natural laccase, providing an efficient and reusable solution for industrial applications. The dual&#8208;site mechanism, where copper facilitates phenol oxidation and cobalt&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 supports oxygen reduction, is thoroughly explored.







Abstract
Laccase, a multi&#8208;copper oxidase, is limited by its optimal temperature range and isolation costs. To overcome these challenges, we synthesized copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67) with 16&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu as an artificial laccase catalyst. The introduced Cu site acts as the phenol oxidation site, and Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 is the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction site. Laccase also employs this division of oxidation and reduction sites. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 demonstrated significant catalytic activity, superior to natural laccase, especially at elevated temperatures, and maintained stability across multiple reaction cycles. These findings suggest that Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 is a robust, reusable alternative for industrial applications requiring high thermal stability and efficient catalysis.

         <title>Skeletal Isomerization of Ergosterol&#8208;5,8&#8208;Peroxide Leading to the Discovery of Unprecedented Ergostanes and Collective Syntheses of 5,6&#8208;Epoxysterols and (+)&#8208;Sarocladione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol via a 5,8&#8208;peroxy intermediate were explored through chemical synthesis. This research not only facilitated access to rare sterols found in mushrooms but also led to the discovery of an unusual tricyclic ergostane and elucidation of a biosynthetic pathway for a structurally complex natural product. Additionally, some of the sterols were found to inhibit the aggregation and deposition of amyloid &#946;.







Abstract
Skeletal isomerization of ergosterol peroxide, a primary oxidation product of ergosterol, was investigated under thermal and iron(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. Thermal isomerization resulted in not only the isolation of the predicted 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,6&#8208;epoxides but also the discovery of the unprecedented 7/9/5&#8208;ring&#8208;fused ergostane for the first time. The iron(II)&#8208;mediated isomerization proceeded at ambient temperature, resulting in the formation of the expected 5,6&#8208;epoxysterols and a ring&#8208;opened bicyclic diketone. The diketone was further converted into novel ergostane under thermal conditions and into (+)&#8208;sarocladione under acidic conditions. All transformations from ergosterol to sarocladione, including the isolation of the unstable diketone intermediate, were achieved at ambient temperature, confirming the biosynthetic pathway of sarocladione. Several mushroom ingredients with a 5,6&#8208;epoxy group were synthesized stereoselectively from the isomerization products, leading to the confirmation or revision of the structures of natural products. The &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of synthetic sterols was evaluated for the first time to gain insights into the potential for dementia prevention. This study is valuable both for supplying rare sterols found in mushrooms for biological studies and for shedding light on the oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol.

         <title>Spin Crossover and Its Application in Organometallic Catalysis: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article discusses the influence of spin crossover in open&#8208;shell metal catalytic reactions. It introduces the development of key concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; and their impact on the field, proposing the concept of &#8220;spin&#8208;responsive catalysis&#8221; to encompass the effects of spin states, drawing on recent studies to highlight the role of spin crossover in reaction dynamics, pathways, and selectivity.







Abstract
Spin crossover is one of the most important properties of open&#8208;shell metal complexes. In organometallic catalytic reactions, catalysts can alter reaction kinetics by spin crossover, i.&#8201;e., accelerating or hindering the reaction progression, as well as altering reaction pathways, modulating the reaction selectivity or promoting new reactions. This personal account outlines the introduction and development of important concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; involving spin crossover, and proposes a new concept, &#8220;spin&#8208;responsive catalysis&#8221; to summarize the catalytic processes in which spin effects are present. Finally, the electronic mechanism of spin crossover accelerating the reaction and the role of spin crossover in changing the reaction path and regulating the reaction selectivity are introduced by taking two recent typical iron&#8208;catalyzed reactions recently reported by our group as examples.

Images adapted with permission from references 16 and 19, copyright John Wiley and Sons and American Chemical Society. Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of bright, photostable nanoparticles owing to their rigid interior matrix. They have tunable photophysical properties, as nearly any hydrophobic dye can be used in their preparation. Pictured here is a cartoon representation of a g&#8208;Odot as well as a photo of orange&#8208;emissive g&#8208;Odots in water. A scanning electron microscopy image of a sample of g&#8208;Odots is also shown (scale bar=300&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of luminescent nanoparticles that offer enhanced photostability, superior brightness, and modular tunability compared to other commonly employed nanoparticles. In the last several years, they have been used as bioimaging probes for single&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon cellular imaging, exhibiting low cytotoxicity even after several days. While they are emerging as promising materials for use in biological applications, g&#8208;Odots face several key challenges before their use can become widespread. In this concept, we outline the state of the literature on g&#8208;Odots and highlight a few ways in which their design and use can be improved upon.

         <title>A Combined Experimental and Computational Exploration of Heteroleptic cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2 Coordination Cages through Geometric Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations based on ligand geometries and computed energies of coordination assemblies were compared against experimental results working towards rationalising the self&#8208;assembly of heteroleptic Pd2L2L&#8217;2&#8208;type coordination cages. Valuable insights into the use and limitations of the approaches examined were gained in the continued development of high&#8208;throughput methods to aid molecular design.







Abstract
Heteroleptic (mixed&#8208;ligand) coordination cages are of interest as host systems with more structurally and functionally complex cavities than homoleptic architectures. The design of heteroleptic cages, however, is far from trivial. In this work, we experimentally probed the self&#8208;assembly of Pd(II) ions with binary ligand combinations in a combinatorial fashion to search for new cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2 heteroleptic cages. A hierarchy of computational analyses was then applied to these systems with the aim of elucidating key factors for rationalising self&#8208;assembly outcomes. Simple and inexpensive geometric analyses were shown to be effective in identifying complementary ligand pairs. Preliminary results demonstrated the viability of relatively rapid semi&#8208;empirical calculations for predicting the topology of thermodynamically favoured assemblies with rigid ligands, whilst more flexible systems proved challenging. Stemming from this, key challenges were identified for future work developing effective computational forecasting tools for self&#8208;assembled metallo&#8208;supramolecular systems.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Synthesis of Renewable Isoprene Over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 Composite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct synthesis of renewable isoprene from bio&#8208;sourced methanol and isobutene was achieved via a novel Prins tandem route on Mo&#8722;Fe oxide and MgO/Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts. Spectroscopic characterization experiments together with DFT calculations reveal that the excellent catalytic performance is closely related to the appropriate proportion of basic and acidic OH groups after MgO hydration.







Abstract
Synthesis of renewable isoprene continues to attract significant interest, yet catalysts still need improvement for industrial applications. We report herein an efficient and novel Prins tandem approach for highly selective production of isoprene from bio&#8208;based methanol and isobutene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8722;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 acid&#8208;base bifunctional catalysts. Hydration decreases the number of strong basic sites O2&#8722; ions and increases OH groups over MgO, thus improving the isoprene selectivity. Basic OH on Mg(OH)2 promotes the Prins condensation of formaldehyde and isobutene, while acidic OH promotes dehydration of isoprenol to isoprene. Suitable contents and proportions of basic and acidic OH groups over Mg(OH)2 increase isoprene selectivity and methanol conversion to 90 and 92&#8201;% on the Mo&#8208;Fe&#8722;O+Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts, respectively. It exhibits good recycling stability, with isoprene selectivity remaining 90&#8201;% after five successive regenerations. DFT calculations reveal OH groups formed after hydration reduce the energy barrier of the H transfer step, thereby promoting the overall reaction.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a collection of phenyl&#8208; and hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;fused porphyrin conjugates is presented. The architectures&#8217; intriguing absorption properties were investigated, revealing the influence of the number of porphyrins, the degree of &#960;&#8208;extension, and their relative position in the molecule.







Abstract
A library of novel &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) architectures is presented. Two distinct synthetic pathways were utilized to obtain either phenyl&#8208; or HBC&#8208;fused compounds. Absorption experiments reveal the species&#8217; exciting photophysical and optoelectronic properties. Depending on the degree of &#960;&#8208;extension, the number of porphyrins, and their relative position, a decisive change in shape, panchromatic broadening, and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption curves is observed. Theoretical studies give more profound insight into the molecule's electronic structures, showing vast decreases in HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps.

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Site&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Aziridination of Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Palladium/Copper/Iodide/Oxygen Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes has been developed to achieve regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective aziridination under the synergistic effects of PdII, CuI, I&#8722;, and O2. A series of vinylaziridines were synthesised using tosyl&#8208;protected amine as the nitrogen source and oxygen as the terminal oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species undergoes an unusual iodination to form an allyl iodide, followed by an intramolecular SN2&#8242; substitution to yield the vinylaziridine product.







Abstract
Vinylaziridines are important building blocks in organic chemistry, especially in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The direct and efficient transfer of an appropriate nitrogen source to readily accessible conjugated dienes is a notable methodology. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes through a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species should be an ideal method for the selective synthesis of vinylaziridines. However, this method faces the challenge of regioselectivity, often resulting in 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization instead. In this study, we developed a Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes via a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species to achieve regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective aziridination under the synergistic effects of PdII, CuI, I&#8722;, and O2. The &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium species formed in the system undergoes an unusual iodination process, leading to the formation of an allyl iodide intermediate. Subsequently, the vinylaziridine is obtained through intramolecular SN2&#8242; substitution of the allyl iodide.

         <title>Responsive Chirality: Tailoring Supramolecular Assemblies with External Stimuli as Future Platforms for Electronic/Spintronic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External stimuli via solvents, additives, temperature, and light profoundly switch chirality in self&#8208;assembly systems, allowing precise control over molecular interactions and assembly pathways. Such modulation offers promising opportunities for designing dynamic responsive materials for use in photonics, electronics, and spintronics. This review highlights how stimuli&#8208;driven chiral modulation could shape future&#8208;generation functional supramolecular materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular chirality is the major branch of supramolecular chemistry, which not only plays important roles in biological processes but also in synthetically designed aggregated systems. To understand the complex processing of biological systems, the only way is to design supramolecular chiral ensembles that mimic natural biomolecules such as Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), Ribonucleic acid (RNA), amino acids, etc. In addition, chiral systems and self&#8208;assemblies as molecular motifs with breaking spatial inversion symmetry have been regarded as key substances in electronics and spintronics as well as in fundamental chemistry and physics. Here, in this review, our major concern is understanding modulation in spatial arrangements and packing modes under the impact of any external stimuli, which results in tailoring the handedness of resulted supramolecular chiral superstructures. We, in this review, highlighted the role of external stimuli such as solvent, chemical additives, photo exposure, etc. in altering the supramolecular chirality for their future utility as &#8220;active switches&#8221; in optoelectronic and spintronic devices and applications.

Here, in this review, our major concern is understanding modulation in spatial arrangements and packing modes under the impact of any external stimuli, which results in tailoring the handedness of resulted supramolecular chiral superstructures. We, in this review, highlighted the role of external stimuli such as solvent, chemical additives, photo exposure, etc. in altering the supramolecular chirality for their future utility as &#8220;active switches&#8221; in optoelectronic and spintronic devices and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6: A Hexagonal Prismatic Metalloid Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and shape of metalloid clusters are heavily influenced by the ligands used for their protection. By carrying out a previously developed synthetic route for Ag64(PnBu3)16Cl6 with a different phosphine, the metalloid cluster Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6 can be obtained. Its unusual hexagonal prismatic shape as well as similarities with its smaller congener give further insight into the formation process of faceted silver nanoparticles.







Abstract
The ligands used for the protection of metalloid clusters heavily influence the resulting structure and shape. For silver, thiolate and alkynyl ligands are commonly used, while phosphines usually play a minor role as co&#8208;ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6 (1), the largest structurally characterized metalloid silver cluster with phosphines and halides as sole ligands. Instead of the frequently observed spherical shape of metalloid clusters, 1&#8217;s structure resembles a hexagonal prism. The highly light and temperature sensitive compound features many similarities to its smaller congener Ag64(PnBu3)16Cl6, though there are distinct structural and electronic differences present. Within 1, a Ag64 subunit can be found, which identifies these clusters as molecular seeds for the formation of faceted nanoparticles.

         <title>A CH4&#8208;Driven Ion Cloud&#8208;Stretched Approach Enables ICP&#8208;qMS for Multiplex Single&#8208;Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) is now able to perform a multiplex single&#8208;cell analysis based on a CH4&#8208;driven CRC&#8208;stretched ion cloud approach. A CH4&#8208;driven collision&#8208;reaction&#8208;cell (CRC)&#8208;stretched ion cloud approach (CH4&#8208;CRC) enables inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) to perform a multiplex single&#8208;cell analysis. Quantification of single&#8208;cell's multiple phenotype protein markers can thus be achieved on ICP&#8208;(CH4&#8208;CRC)&#8208;qMS, not only revealing the heterogeneity between the single cells but also realizing an unambiguous cell&#8208;classification of their subtypes.







Abstract
In the last 40&#8197;years, inductively coupled plasma quadrupole (q) mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) has been recognized as one of the best tools for the quantification of multiple elements/isotopes and even the biomolecules they labeled in a homogeneous solution sample. However, it meets a tough challenge when acquiring multi&#8208;m/z signals from an intact single&#8208;cell dispersed in a cell suspension, since the single&#8208;cell ion cloud generated in ICP presents an intermittently transient event with a duration time of hundreds of microseconds while the dwell time plus settling time of the q is at the similar time scale when peak&#8208;hopping between different m/z. Herein, we report CH4 is able to stretch the single&#8208;cell ion cloud duration time to more than 7,000&#8197;&#956;s in collision&#8208;reaction&#8208;cell (CRC), allowing multi&#8208;m/z signals acquisition by ICP&#8208;qMS. Quantification of single&#8208;cell's multiple phenotype protein markers can thus be achieved on ICP&#8208;(CH4&#8208;CRC)&#8208;qMS, not only revealing the heterogeneity between the single cells but also enabling an unambiguous cell&#8208;classification of their subtypes. CH4&#8208;driven ion cloud&#8208;stretched approach breaks through the long&#8208;standing bottleneck limited single&#8208;cell multiplex analysis on ICP&#8208;qMS, paving a path for more important applications of ICP&#8208;qMS in the fields related to single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Heterometallic [2]Catenane&#8208;Crosslinked Supramolecular Networks with Improved Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic [2]catenane&#8208;crosslinked supramolecular networks are prepared based on the crosslinking of polyethylene glycol (PEG) using a [2]catenane unit. By adjusting the molecular weight of PEG, the solubility of the networks can be tuned and gels are formed. The introduction of [2]catenane offers good antibacterial properties owing to the synergistic antimicrobial activity of Pt(II) and Cu(I) ions in the [2]catenane.







Abstract
The construction of supramolecular networks with novel crosslinks is of great significance in expanding their chemical structures and exploring their advanced functions. Herein, we prepare a type of [2]catenane&#8208;cored supramolecular networks based on the crosslinking of polyethylene glycol (PEG) using a heterometallic [2]catenane unit. By adjusting the molecular weight of PEG, the solubility of the networks can be tuned and gels are formed using low molecular weight PEG. The introduction of heterometallic [2]catenane offers the networks good antibacterial properties owing to the synergistic antimicrobial activity of Pt(II) and Cu(I) ions in the [2]catenane. This study provides a simple and efficient strategy for constructing supramolecular networks with topological crosslinks as antibacterial materials, which will promote the structural design and biological applications of supramolecular networks.

         <title>Effect of Oriented External Electric Field in Altering Magnetic Exchange and Magnetic Anisotropy in Lanthanide&#8208;Radical Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of Oriented&#8208;External Electric Fields (OEEF) induces structural modifications capable of toggling the exchange coupling from anti&#8208;ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic in Gd&#8208;radical complex and improve the SMM performance in Dy&#8208;radical complexes.







Abstract
Magnetic exchange coupling (J) is one of the important spin Hamiltonian parameters that control the magnetic characteristics of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While numerous chemical methodologies have been proposed to modify ligands and control the J value, and magneto&#8208;structural correlations have been developed accordingly, altering this parameter through non&#8208;chemical means remains a challenging task. This study explores the impact of an Oriented&#8208;External Electric Field (OEEF) on over twenty lanthanide&#8208;radical complexes using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio Complete Active Space Self&#8208;Consistent Field (CASSCF) methods. Five complexes &#8211; [{(Me3Si)2N]2Gd(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1), [Gd(Hbpz3)2(dtbsq)] (2), [Gd(hfac)3(IM&#8208;2py)] (3), [Gd(hfac)3(NITBzImH)] (4), and [Gd(hfac)3{2Py&#8208;NO}(H2O)] (5) &#8211; were selected for detailed analysis, revealing significant OEEF effects on magnetic exchange interactions and structural parameters. Various parameters such as bond distances, bond angles, and torsional angles were examined as a function of OEEF to establish guiding principles for molecule selection. In complexes 1, 2, and 3, OEEF influenced torsional angles and altered exchange interactions. Complex 4 demonstrated enhanced ferromagnetic coupling under OEEF, reaching a maximum J value of +5.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Complex 5 reveals switching the sign of JGd&#8208;rad exchange interaction from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic under OEEF, highlighting the potential of electric fields in designing materials with tuneable magnetic properties. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and applications in advanced materials and molecular electronics.

         <title>Influence of Pnictogen and Ligand Framework on the Lewis Acidity and Steric Environment in Pnictogen Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure and steric profiles of pnictogen pincer complexes from 16 ligand classes are studied computationally. The results yield insights into stereoelectronic variations both as a function of ligand and pnictogen choice, which, together with previous work on geometric variations (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402851), provide a comprehensive understanding of this class of molecules.







Abstract
Pnictogen pincer complexes are a fascinating class of compounds due to their dynamic molecular and electronic structures, and valuable stoichiometric or catalytic reactivity. As recognition of their unique chemistry has grown, so too has the library of pincer ligands employed and pnictogen centres engaged to prepare them. Here we computationally study how the choice of pincer ligand framework and pnictogen influence the electronic and steric outcomes within the complexes obtained. The most relevant electronic parameter is the pnictogen&#8208;centred electrophilicity, which has been quantified by fluoride ion affinities and LUMO energies, while the most relevant steric parameter is the crowding around the central pnictogen, which has been quantified by the %Vbur values and visualized using steric maps. The resulting trends are analyzed with reference to binding pocket size, acceptor orbital type, electronic delocalization, &#960;&#8208;donor strengths, and heteroatom incorporation. Thus, considering 16 ligand frameworks and 4 heavy pnictogen centres, this study provides a broad&#8208;spectrum view of stereo&#8208;electronic variation in pnictogen pincer complexes, which, together with a recent study on geometric variation in the same family, provides a substantial dataset to guide future molecular design and reactivity studies.

         <title>Emergent Behavior of a Photoswitchable Solute in a Biphasic Solvent System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple approach to complex behavior is provided by placing a photoswitch in a two&#8208;phase system. Depending on which phase is irradiated, different out of equilibrium stationary states can be accessed, including photostationary states not accessible in either of the pure phases.







Abstract
Due to thermal E/Z isomerization, hydrazones in solution typically exist in thermodynamic equilibria between their isomers. Irradiation of such solutions leads to photostationary states that may differ from the equilibrium distribution. Operating such switchable hydrazones in a biphasic system of two immiscible solvents introduces three new degrees of freedom: the E/Z equilibrium in the second solvent and two equilibria for distribution of each of the isomers between the solvents. Irradiation of such a system can be performed in three different ways &#8211; the first solvent only, the second solvent only, and both solvents at once &#8211; all yielding distinct outcomes. Depending on the choice of materials and the mode of irradiation, such setup may lead to different emergent behaviors that are not immediately intuitive, including net cyclic transport or the accumulation of one photoswitched product in one of the phases, beyond what is reachable by irradiating a simple solution of the same photoswitch.

         <title>Na Ions Doped Fe2VO4 Cathode for High Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully created FVO&#8722;Na using a straightforward hydrothermal process. The intercalation of Na+ prevents the crystal structure from effectively stabilizing. As a result, FVO&#8242;s cycling performance increased. Additionally, at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the discharge capacity reached 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and at a current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacity retention nearly reached 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are thought to be a new generation of secondary batteries that will replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their great safety and inexpensive cost. In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and when the current density is arising 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the specific capacity also reaches 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99&#8201;%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The superior electrochemical performance proves that FVO&#8722;Na is an ideal cathode material for zinc ion batteries.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Substituted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes with Windmill Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microwave&#8208;assisted substitution reaction of fluorinated HBC derivatives provided switchable N&#8208;heterocyclic HBCs with windmill architectures in a straightforward fashion. The formation of metastable conformers was observed experimentally and investigated by computational analysis. Additionally, the electronic effect of different electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic substituents on the HBC core was investigated experimentally and by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and computational investigation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Following our method for the preparation of thioether&#8208;substituted HBCs, we prepared pyrrole&#8208;, indole&#8208;, carbazole&#8208;, and 1H&#8208;benz[g]indole&#8208;substituted HBCs from the corresponding fluorinated precursors under microwave irradiation. A series of polysubstituted benzoindole&#8208;HBCs with windmill architectures was also synthesized using the polyfluorinated HBC analogs, and the substituent effects on the electronic properties of the HBC core were investigated. Similar to the thioether substituted HBCs, the nature of the heterocycle does not influence the optoelectronic properties of the HBC core. The attachment of multiple benzoindole substituents leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission spectra, comparable to our previous studies. Due to the circular arrangement of the benzoindole moiety, the attachment of multiple substituents results in the presence of multiple conformers at room temperature. The rotation barrier can be overcome by heating the compounds to 323&#8211;333&#8197;K. Additionally, the investigation of the relaxed geometries shows two &#960;&#8208;stacking motifs within the conformers.

         <title>Comparative Analysis of Tetravalent Actinide Schiff Base Complexes: Influence of Donor and Ligand Backbone on Molecular Geometry and Metal Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel tetravalent actinide (AnIV) compounds with the Schiff base ligand pyrophen, including the transuranium elements Np and Pu, are characterized in solid state and solution, as well as by quantum chemical calculations. Especially, the combination of NMR and high&#8208;level quantum chemistry for the evaluation of structure and bond properties in the actinide complexes has proven a powerful tool.







Abstract
A series of isostructural early actinide AnIV complexes was synthesized in order to investigate the influence of a conjugated framework in the ligand backbone on An bonding. Therefore, the AnIV complexes [An(pyrophen)2] (An = Th, U, Np, and Pu) with the pure N&#8211;donor ligand bis(2&#8208;pyrrolecarbonylaldehyde)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine referred to as pyrophen, were synthesized and characterized. Solid state analysis via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) reveals two sets of ligands binding in an almost orthogonal arrangement to the actinide center. For the larger actinides Th and U, the coordination sphere allows for additional coordination by a solvent molecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies show the presence of highly symmetrical complexes in solution in good agreement with the solvent&#8208;free solid structures. While SC&#8208;XRD suggests mainly ionic binding, an analysis of paramagnetic NMR contributions and quantum chemical bond analysis hint towards significant covalency in the U, Np, and Pu compounds. This series of An complexes allowed for a thorough structural and theoretical comparison of a conjugated system to a closely related N&#8208;donor ligand (pyren)[1] as well as to the mixed N,O Schiff base ligands salophen (conjugated) and salen (non&#8208;conjugated).

&lt;p&gt;Novel tetravalent actinide (AnIV) compounds with the Schiff base ligand pyrophen, including the transuranium elements Np and Pu, are characterized in solid state and solution, as well as by quantum chemical calculations. Especially, the combination of NMR and high-level quantum chemistry for the evaluation of structure and bond properties in the actinide complexes has proven a powerful tool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of isostructural early actinide An&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complexes was synthesized in order to investigate the influence of a conjugated framework in the ligand backbone on An bonding. Therefore, the An&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complexes [An(pyrophen)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (An = Th, U, Np, and Pu) with the pure N&#8211;donor ligand bis(2-pyrrolecarbonylaldehyde)-o-phenylenediamine referred to as pyrophen, were synthesized and characterized. Solid state analysis via single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) reveals two sets of ligands binding in an almost orthogonal arrangement to the actinide center. For the larger actinides Th and U, the coordination sphere allows for additional coordination by a solvent molecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies show the presence of highly symmetrical complexes in solution in good agreement with the solvent-free solid structures. While SC-XRD suggests mainly ionic binding, an analysis of paramagnetic NMR contributions and quantum chemical bond analysis hint towards significant covalency in the U, Np, and Pu compounds. This series of An complexes allowed for a thorough structural and theoretical comparison of a conjugated system to a closely related N-donor ligand (pyren)&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; as well as to the mixed N,O &lt;i&gt;Schiff&lt;/i&gt; base ligands salophen (conjugated) and salen (non-conjugated).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dinuclear Dysprosium Compounds: The Importance of Rigid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipolar vs exchange coupling in bis&#8208;fluorido and peroxido bridged dinuclear Dy complexes lead to ferro vs antiferromagnetic coupling with consequences for the magnetic dynamics. The peroxide&#8208;bridged compound is a rare of example of the direct addition of hydrogen peroxide and significantly outperforms the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged analogue as a result of the reduction of vibrational freedom through the rigidity of the bridge.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, structures and magnetic behaviour of two isostructural dinuclear Dy3+ complexes where the metal ions of a previously reported monomeric building block are connected by a peroxide (O22&#8722;) or a pair of fluoride (2&#215;F&#8722;) bridges. The nature of the bridge determines the distance between the metal ion dipoles leading to a dipolar coupling in the peroxido bridged compound of only ca. 70&#8201;% of that in the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged dimer. The sign of the overall coupling between the metals is antiferromagnetic for the peroxido bridged compound and ferromagnetic for the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged complex. This in turn influences the magnetisation dynamics. We compare the relaxation characteristics of the dimers with those of the previously reported monomeric building block. The relaxation dynamics for the bis&#8208;fluorido system are very fast. On the other hand, comparing the properties of the monomer, the peroxido bridged sample and the corresponding Y&#8208;doped sample show that the relaxation properties via a Raman process have very similar parameters. We show that a second dysprosium is important for either tuning or detuning the Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) properties of a system.

A ZAB with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO cathodic catalyst achieves a remarkable cycling stability for 788&#8197;h. The perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948; (PBMCRO) composite was constructed by in situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C with more exposing active sites. A conductive pathway for oxygen ions and electrons was built, thereby enhancing the electrochemical bifunctional properties. This rational design strategy shows great potential for facilitating synthesis of perovskite based catalysts for energy conversion and storage applications.







Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. In this study, we synthesized a Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948; (PBMCRO) perovskite composite with in&#8197;situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C, functioning as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc&#8208;air batteries. The in&#8197;situ exsolution of CoRu nanoparticles from the perovskite oxide was facilitated by the reducing action of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM). Concurrently, Co&#8211;N&#8211;C was used to decorate PBMCRO, forming a novel bifunctional composite electrode of Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO. The incorporation of CoRu nanoparticles introduces a significant number of electrochemically active oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix, enhancing ORR and OER performance. Additionally, the Co&#8211;N&#8211;C synergistically improves electrochemical activity while preserving the structural stability of the perovskite oxide. The prepared Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced bifunctional performance compared to the undecorated pristine perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3&#8722;&#948; (PBMO). The zinc&#8208;air battery with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst achieve a peak power density of approximately 90&#8197;mW/cm2 and exhibit remarkable cycling stability for 788&#8197;h. This study presents a novel and effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of perovskite&#8208;based air electrodes for rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.

         <dc:description>
This minireview aims to highlight recent advancement in analytical approaches that can effectively enrich single nucleotide variants for improved clinical diagnostics. Based on when the enrichment step takes place, we categorize all enrichment strategies into pre&#8208;PCR, post&#8208;PCR, and during&#8208;PCR methods.







Abstract
Over the past three decades, significant advancements have been made in mutation enrichment methods, driven by the increasing need for precise and efficient identification of rare genetic variants associated with diseases. Mutation&#8208;enrichment methods have emerged to boost sensitivity and enable easy detection of low&#8208;frequency mutations. These methods are crucial in genomics research and clinical diagnostics, allowing for the detection of low&#8208;frequency mutations within large genomic datasets. This review presents a summary of technological developments in rare mutation enrichment and emphasizes their mechanisms and applications in liquid biopsies.

         <title>PnictogenIII Dications Supported by BZIMPY Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two homologous series of dicationic Lewis acids featuring PnIII&#8208;X (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl, Ph) fragments supported by 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands are described. These compounds are moderate Lewis acids and they behave as versatile PnIII transfer reagents in reactions with other Lewis bases. The salts can also be chemically and electrochemically reduced to PnI compounds.







Abstract
Two homologous series of pnictogen(III) dications, stabilized by 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands have been prepared. Both series contain PnIII&#8208;X moieties (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl or Ph) and have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods including X&#8208;ray crystallography. The Lewis acidity of these compounds has also been probed by computational methods; the results suggest that the dictations are strong Lewis acids, with the PnCl2+ compounds being more acidic than the PnPh2+ compounds, and with Lewis acidity increasing from P to Bi, in both series. The PhP2+&#8208;containing compound was also found to be a versatile PIII transfer reagent, leading to new synthetic routes for various PhP&#8208;containing compounds. The redox chemistry of all compounds has also been probed using cyclic voltammetry and chemical reductions. In some cases the resulting PnI moieties could be trapped using diazabutadienes.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidation of UV Filters: A First&#8208;Principles Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an in&#8197;silico study, the reactions of water contaminated with UV filters in an oxidizing environment are simulated. By following the motion of Wannier centers, the movement of the orbitals during the reactions are tracked, thus distinguishing, for instance, redox reactions from acid&#8208;base reactions. The reactivity trends and pathways are highlighted.







Abstract
A theoretical model is proposed to study the oxidation mechanisms of the organic UV filters BP3 and BP4 during electrochemical water treatment utilizing Car&#8208;Parrinello molecular dynamics. Factors such as the amount of solvent to be included and how to design the system with the least possible intervention are discussed. The proposed model consist of the optimization of the geometries by density functional theory methods, the equilibration of the structure immersed in a water box, the inclusion of the reactive species, and the analysis of the reaction energies of each reaction pathway. The ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations lead to several products, and some trends can be identified, in accordance with the well&#8208;known reactivity rules of organic chemistry. The products proposed in this work are intermediates in longer oxidative pathways.

         <title>Construction of a Fluorinated&#8208;Anion Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Exhibiting Dual&#8208;Pore Architecture for Simultaneous Enhancement of C2H2 Adsorption Capacity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorinated&#8208;anion pillared metal&#8208;organic framework (APMOF) featuring a dual&#8208;pore architecture has been successfully constructed. This framework demonstrates exceptional C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity, effectively balancing the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity.







Abstract
Physisorption&#8208;based separation processes represents a promising alternative to the conventional thermally driven methods, such as cryogenic separation. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity of adsorbents. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorinated&#8208;anion pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) featuring a dual&#8208;pore architecture, constructed using a pyridine&#8208;oxazole bifunctional ligand. The inherent low symmetry of the ligand leads to significant distortion of the fluorinated&#8208;anion pillars, resulting in a distinctive type of APMOFs characterized by dual&#8208;pore architecture. On pore structure with constrict pore width is enriched with a high density of anion fluorinated pillars, offering numerous active sites advantageous for enhancing separation selectivity. Concurrently, the other pore structure exhibits larger dimensions, facilitating increased gas molecule accommodation and thereby augmenting adsorption capacity. Gas sorption studies reveal a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity and a high C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance, while theoretical investigations elucidate a sequential adsorption process within these APMOFs, underscoring the efficacy of this strategy in overcoming trade&#8208;off limits in adsorbents.

         <title>Free Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Radical Alkynylation and Allylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The daunting challenges in converting alcoholic O&#8208;H bonds with high bond&#8208;dissociation energy (BDE) to alkoxy radicals and harnessing those unruly reaction species largely limit exploiting free alcohols in C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization. Herein we describe a novel radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds with unmodified aliphatic alcohols. The use of phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) enables the formation of alkoxy radicals under mild photochemical conditions. &#945;&#8208;Methyl styrene serves as a sacrificial&#8208;reagent that significantly improves the reaction outcomes. This transition&#8208;metal free protocol further features broad substrate scope, exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we present a novel approach for synthesising a merocyanine (MC) compound that integrates gallol and a near&#8209;infrared (NIR) fluorophore using a straightforward method. We conduct a comprehensive structural analysis to elucidate the specific roles of each functional group during monomer synthesis and their effects on the properties of both the spiropyran (SP) and MC forms, particularly their fluorescence. As a proof of concept, we explore the use of these compounds in formulating innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings by melanising catechol and gallol moieties on various substrates, including glass, a cupronickel coin, and an organic polymer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bioinspired approach utilizing the melanisation of a catechol and gallol moiety containing merocyanine.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sodium Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Deep Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construct metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) strategy to provide three&#8208;dimensional coordination bonds network to protect the organic ligands intrinsic Hydrogen bond network. The MOF&#8208;based phosphor exhibits the suppression of the nonradiative decay of singlet and triplet excitons, from and promote the inter&#8208;system scampering and the rate of radiative decay, and achieve the long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature dark&#8208;blue phosphorescence.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to manufacture room&#8208;temperature blue long afterglow phosphorescent materials adapted to environmental conditions. Herein, an Na&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was constructed using Na+ and 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, which exhibits long&#8208;lived of 378.9&#8197;ms, deep blue and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, meanwhile possesses the visible blue afterglow for 3~6&#8197;seconds after removing excitation light source. The three&#8208;dimensional coordination bonds network provided by Na&#8208;based MOF protects the organic ligands intrinsic hydrogen bond network, resulting in the phosphor lifetime and residual color remaining unchanged in different gas atmospheres. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveals that the rigid Na&#8208;based MOF structure can limit the rotation and vibration of the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent organic ligands. This limitation results in the suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay for both singlet and triplet excitons, promotes intersystem crossing, and increases the rate of radiative decay, ultimately achieving long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.

         <title>Triscyanocorrole, the Newest and Most Intriguing Member of the C1&#8208;Substituted Corrole Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare CF3/CN conversion is reported as a facile synthetic approach towards 5,10,15&#8208;triscyanocorrole, whose gallium, phosphorus, and cobalt complexes were fully characterized. The meso&#8208;nitrile groups strongly affect photophysical properties, redox potentials and coordination chemistry. Light absorption and emission take place at longer wavelengths and the excited state lifetimes are larger, reduction of both the corrole macrocycle and metals chelated by it becomes easier, and the relative orientation of axial pyridine ligands is perpendicular rather than parallel.







Abstract
Considering the potential advantages of minimally sized corroles for diverse applications, this study reports a facile access to cyano&#8208;substituted derivatives via a rare CF3/CN conversion. Investigation of the fully characterized gallium, phosphorus, and cobalt complexes discloses multiple effects of the meso&#8208;nitrile groups attached to the macrocycle. This corrole appears to be the most electron poor derivative which comes into play in the redox potentials of the corresponding complexes. Compared to its precursor, both the absorption and emission are strongly red shifted and the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield are much larger. The coordination chemistry is affected as well, by virtue of axial ligands being perpendicular rather than parallel relative to each other.

         <title>Target Fisher: A Consensus Structure&#8208;Based Target Prediction Tool, and its Application in the Discovery of Selective MAO&#8208;B Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Target Fisher, a novel structure&#8208;based target prediction tool is introduced. It offers activity predictions for 37 targets using a consensus docking/machine learning approach. We demonstrate its application by screening a natural products library against targets relevant for neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in the discovery of three new monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. Target Fisher is available both as a stand&#8208;alone software and also via a webserver.







Abstract
In this work we introduce Target Fisher, a consensus structure&#8208;based target prediction tool that integrates molecular docking and machine learning with the aim to aid in the identification of potential biological targets and the optimization of the use of bioassays. Target Fisher uses per&#8208;residue energy decomposition profiles extracted from docking poses as fingerprints to train target&#8208;specific machine learning models. It provides predictions for a curated set of 37 protein targets, covering a diverse range of biological entities, and offers a user&#8208;friendly interface accessible via a web server (https://gqc.quimica.unlp.edu.ar/targetfisher/). In this sense, Target Fisher is a valuable tool to aid organic and medicinal chemistry groups in target identification, drug discovery and drug repurposing. As a case study, we demonstrate the efficacy of Target Fisher by screening a small library of assorted natural products for targets relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, which resulted in the identification and experimental validation of selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO&#8722;B).

         <title>Hollow Superhelices Based on Chiral Europium Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of Eu(NO3)3/R/S&#8208;pempH2 assemblies can be controlled by pH and concentration of reactants, forming block crystals R/S&#8208;1&#8201;b, hollow superhelices R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh, rod crystals R/S&#8208;3&#8201;r, and solid superhelices R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) studies show that the hollow superhelix of R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh has a larger dissymmetry factor than the corresponding solid superhelix R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh.







Abstract
The construction of helical nanotubes based on chiral coordination polymers (CPs) is an intriguing but challenging task, which is important for the development of functional materials that combine macroscopic chirality with tube&#8208;related properties. Here, we selected a chiral europium phosphonate system, e.&#8201;g., Eu(NO3)3/R&#8208;,S&#8208;pempH2, and carried out a systematic work. By controlling the hydrothermal reaction conditions such as the pH value of the reaction mixture, the molar ratio and concentration of the reactants, we obtained block&#8208;like crystals of R/S&#8208;1&#8201;b, rod&#8208;like crystals of R/S&#8208;3&#8201;r, hollow superhelices of R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh, and solid superhelices of R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh. In the latter two cases, the chirality has been successfully transferred and amplificated from the molecular level to the macroscopic level. Interestingly, compounds R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh and R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh have the same chemical composition of Eu(R/S&#8208;pempH)3&#8901;2H2O and show identical PXRD patterns, thus can be considered as the same material except for different morphologies. We further investigated their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties and found that the hollow superhelix of R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh had a larger dissymmetry factor than the solid superhelix of R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh. This study not only provides the first example of hollow superhelices of chiral CPs, but also offers the possibility of modulating the chiroptical properties of CPs through morphological control.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Organic Photosensitizers Based on 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminophenyl)benzothiazoles for Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazole derivatives have been characterized for their photophysical properties and their triplet energies were determined by DFT calculations. Subsequent application of this new class of photosensitizer in visible&#8208;light [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions revealed a substituent effect on the catalytic efficiency. Mechanistic insights were obtained experimentally and by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We have studied 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazole and related derivatives for their photophysical properties in view of employing them as new and readily tunable organic photocatalysts. Their triplet energies were estimated by DFT calculations to be in the range of 52&#8211;57&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, suggesting their suitability for the [2+2] photocycloaddition of unsaturated acyl imidazoles with styrene derivatives. Experimental studies have shown that 2&#8211;(2&#8211;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles comprising alkylamino groups (NHMe, NHiPr) or the native amino group provide the best photocatalytic results in these visible&#8208;light mediated [2+2] reactions without the need of any additives, yielding a range of cyclobutane derivatives. A combined experimental and theoretical approach has provided insights into the underlying triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer process.

         <title>Photocatalytic Seawater Splitting by Earth&#8208;Abundant Catalysts: Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Metamaterials Made of Plasmonic Magnesium Diboride and Transitional Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photocatalysts for efficient seawater splitting made from metal&#8208;semiconductor hybrid metamaterials are studied in this work. The Earth&#8208;abundant metal MgB2 is employed as main photocatalyst and the TMDs as the co&#8208;catalyst, among which MgB2/WS2 shows the largest enhancement of seawater splitting compared to the separate elements. An efficient mechanical fabrication method is employed to produce MgB2&#8208;TMDCs hybrid photoanodes.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their excellent light harvesting in a broad spectral range as well as efficient charge carrier generation and transfer. In the majority of such metamaterials, semiconductors are used to initiate the water splitting reaction, while their metal counterparts are employed to improve light harvesting through plasmonic effects. Here, we describe for the first time an exceptional reversed case of metal&#8208;semiconductor photocatalysts in which metals are used to initiate the water splitting reaction and semiconductors are employed to improve light harvesting through the blackbody effect and serve as co&#8208;catalysts. The studied photoanodes are made of non&#8208;noble plasmonic MgB2 combined with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The plasmonic resonances of the MgB2 component contribute to field confinement, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling, and hot&#8208;electron transfer providing an enhancement of photoactivity in the entire solar spectrum capable of water splitting. The TMDC component provides impedance matching and enhances light absorption by the metal catalyst. We demonstrate seawater splitting with MgB2&#8208;TMDCs photoanodes attaining current densities of ~3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at solar radiation. The overall efficiency of hydrogen production in seawater splitting by sunlight with the help of the studied photoanodes is 3&#8201;% at a bias voltage of Vbias=0.3&#8197;V.

         <title>Cyclization by Intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling&#8211;A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling as the ring&#8208;forming step in the synthesis of natural products/natural product analogs and synthetic bioactive molecules is reviewed. The reaction has been successfully employed for ring construction across a wide range of ring sizes (from 4 to &#8811;12) in a stereoselective fashion.







Abstract
Ring systems of all sizes are frequent core or substructures in natural products and they are important elements of many drug molecules, as they often confer high binding affinity to and selectivity for disease&#8208;relevant biological targets. A uniform key transformation in the synthesis of such structures is the cyclization step. Among the various approaches that have been developed for ring closure, the intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has emerged as a powerful option for the construction of normal&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized rings as well as macrocycles, due to its stereospecificity, the mild reaction conditions, and the non&#8208;toxic nature of the boron by&#8208;products. In this review, we summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of the application of intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in the construction of (macro)cyclic frameworks of natural products and bioactive molecules of synthetic origin, covering (mostly) examples that have been reported since 2015. Target molecules prepared via intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling as a key step range from natural products/natural product analogs to synthetic drug candidates, featuring ring sizes from 4 to &#8811;12. We highlight the utility, scope, and limitations of the reaction for different ring sizes and arrays of functional groups. Where possible, comparisons with other methods of cyclization are provided.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Electrochemistry of Transition Metal Oxides for Energy Storage: Concepts, Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper employs a jigsaw design to visually merge the concepts of spin and electrochemical energy storage, introducing the novel idea of spin&#8208;electrochemical energy storage. It discusses various mechanisms, modulation methods, spin state characterization techniques, and examines the future prospects and challenges, providing a comprehensive outlook on the development of this emerging technology.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;capacity and cyclically stable transition metal (TM)&#8208;based electrode materials for energy storage devices, such as aqueous ion energy storage systems, is crucial for addressing the growing issue of energy scarcity. The spin state, or spin configuration of the d&#8208;electrons, plays a vital role in the electrochemical energy storage performance of these materials. However, there has been a lack of systematic descriptions regarding the role of spin configurations in electrochemical energy storage to date. This review aims to elucidate the advantages of controlling the spin states of metal centers to enhance energy storage performance and highlights recent progress in employing spin state regulation in electrochemical energy storage. Additionally, it covers the various characterization techniques used to determine spin states. Finally, we discuss the future prospects and challenges within this emerging field, with the aim of accelerating the development of spin&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage technologies. This review also seeks to provide clear and reliable directions for the design and preparation of novel energy storage materials.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Reassignment of the Antitubercular Natural Product Evybactin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We here report the first total synthesis of the antitubercular natural product evybactin, together with the structural reassignment of the previously proposed structure. The optimized synthetic method developed provides access to evybactin on the multi&#8208;hundred&#8208;milligram scale and provides the opportunity for future structure&#8208;activity relationship studies.







Abstract
The escalating threat posed by antibiotic resistance is a global concern and underscores the need for new antibiotics. In this context, the recent discovery of evybactin, a nonribosomal depsipeptide antibiotic that selectively and potently inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis, is particularly noteworthy. Here, we present the first total synthesis of this natural product, along with a revision of its assigned structure. Our studies revealed a disparity between the structure originally proposed for evybactin and its actual configuration. Specifically, the 3&#8208;methylhistidine residue present in the evybactin core macrocycle was found to be of the d&#8208;configuration rather than the previously assigned l&#8208;His(Me). Having addressed this, we further optimized our solid&#8208;phase synthetic route to provide access to evybactin on a multi&#8208;hundred&#8208;milligram scale. Access to such quantities will allow for more comprehensive studies with this promising antibiotic.

         <title>Demonstrating Synergistic Activity of Magnetic Iron Oxide Nano Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation in Heterogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol represents a novel and environmentally benign arylation approach under mild conditions in the heterogeneous phase by merging cooperative photoredox and C&#8722;H activation. Magnetically isolable iron oxide nanoparticles are employed as potent photocatalysts for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond&#8208;forming methods with a broad range of substrates. Detailed mechanistic investigations are performed to justify the presented scientific advancements.







Abstract
This report describes a dual catalytic approach for the versatile C&#8722;H arylation of arenes under photo&#8208;excitation at room temperature. The cooperative catalysis utilizes iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (which mostly contain Fe3O4 along with some &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3) as the potential photocatalyst, which merges with the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation cycle for the reductive generation of aryl radical from aryl diazonium salt, revealing its photocatalytic activities. The method is applicable to a wide range of aryl coupling partners and different directing groups, demonstrating excellent productivity, nice co&#8208;operativity and recyclability. Adequate control experiments and mechanistic studies assisted in establishing the radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism for the C&#8722;H arylation occurring in the heterogeneous phase.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly toward Uniform Multi&#8208;Morphology Fried&#8208;Egg&#8208;Like Nanostructures</title>

         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to create uniform one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D), 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D nanostructures in a controlled manner. However, the examples of generation of uniform multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures from solution self&#8208;assembly of one single polymer sample are rare. Herein, we report the first example of preparation of multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures consisting of an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core of uniform size and platelets protruded from the core by LCDSA of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 (PAMAM = polyamidoamine, Azo = azobenzene) in methanol. It is disclosed that the different aggregation rates for PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 with varying contents of Azo units spontaneously separated nucleation and growth stages, which led to the formation of inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like cores (&#8220;seeds&#8221;) firstly, followed by the formation of platelets protruded from the edges of inner core to give &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures. Additional annealing of initially formed &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles will promote the rearrangement of Azo units to give thermodynamically&#8208;favored &#8220;perfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped micelles with a uniform dimension both in the core and whole structure. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to create uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped nanostructures, but also reveals the essential impact of aggregation kinetics of liquid&#8208;crystalline&#8208;coil BCPs in the formation of multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Cu&#8208;Cd Bimetallic Oxides for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value&#8208;added chemicals such as carbon monoxide (CO) and multicarbon&#160;(C2+). However, the complex reaction pathways of CO2&#160;electro&#8208;reduction reaction (CO2RR) greatly limit the product selectivity and conversion efficiency. Herein, the Cu&#8208;Cd bimetallic oxides catalyst was designed and applied for the CO2RR. The optimized 4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic CO2RR activity for selective CO production in H&#8208;cell using 0.5 M 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)/MeCN as electrolyte. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE(CO)) can be maintained above 90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;2.0 to &#8722;2.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Particularly, the catalyst achieves an impressive FE(CO) of 96.3% with a current density of 60.7 mA cm&#8722;2&#160;at &#8722;2.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Furthermore, scaling up the 4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst into a flow cell can reach 56.64% FE of C2+&#160;products (ethylene, ethanol and n&#8208;propanol) with a current density as high as 600 mA cm&#8722;2&#160;steadily.&#160;The excellent CO2RR performance of the as&#8208;synthesized 4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO&#160;can be mainly attributed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost&#160;activation and conversion&#160;key intermediates of CO2RR and ensure the continuous stability of&#160;4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO&#160;in electrolysis process.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Sulfurization of Cubic Cu2O to Form Cu2S Nanostructure&#8208;Decorated Catalysts for Light&#8208;enhanced Electrocatalytic H2 Evolution and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis suffers from sluggish charge transfer and poor photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion rate. Herein, micro&#8208;sized Cu2O cubes were initially prepared for subsequent transformation into Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures by a slight surface sulfurization. The formation of nanostructured Cu2S thin layer at Cu2O surface can endow an immediate charge separation and migration under light irradiation, leading to high surface photovoltages (SPV, 18&#8208;30 mV). As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S catalysts exhibited reduced overpotentials (&#951;, only 86 mV is required for the optimized sample to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2) for H2 evolution with good cycling stability in electrocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, a high methane (CH4) production rate of 30.3 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 can be delivered from the optimized Cu2O@Cu2S sample when used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work has provided a strategy to prepare bifunctional catalysts with improved photoelectric properties for photo/electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Efficiency and Intrinsic Stability of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells through Dimethylamine&#8208;Based Cation Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiency and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important for perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells. However, the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs suffers from severe phase segregation and surface defects. In this study, we propose a cation engineering strategy for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite deposited by a two&#8208;step&#160;sequential method&#160;&#160;through the incorporation of&#160;dimethylamine hydroiodide (DMAI)&#160;into the lead halide complex in the first step. The DMAI additive modifies the crystal structure and grain growth of perovskite film, resulting in enhancing crystal quality, suppressing photo&#8208;induced halide segregation, reducing defect density, and improving charge carrier mobility. As a result, we achieved a champion photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9% for 1.68 eV wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. Additionally, the stability of PSCs based on DMA doped perovskite was strongly enhanced, after being exposed to ambient air for 1500 hours, the unencapsulated device maintained an impressive 80.6% of their initial efficiency, demonstrating great potential for stable and efficient wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Emulsion Interfaces: Surface Chemistry made Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disperse systems, and emulsions in particular, are currently massively used in fields as varied as food industry, cosmetics, health care and environmentally&#8208;friendly materials. To meet increasingly precise needs or targeted applications, these systems need to be endowed with new functionalities at their interfaces, in addition to their composition and structural properties. However, due to the fragility of drops and the low reactivity of their surface, conventional solid surface chemistry cannot be used for such a purpose. Several specific emulsion interface functionalization techniques have thus been developed for targeted systems and applications, but a general framework has yet to be drawn. In this review, we attempt to present these methods in a unified way through the prism of what we may call &#8220;liquid surface chemistry&#8221;. We propose to categorize existing methods into drop&#8208;coating strategies, including layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer techniques and polymer coating, and emulsifier&#8208;carrier approaches involving particles and/or amphiphilic molecules. They are discussed in a transversal way, highlighting the underlying physico&#8208;chemical principles and providing a comparative analysis of their advantages, current limitations and potential for improvement. We also propose future directions and opportunities, involving for instance DNA&#8208;based programmability or artificial intelligence, which could make liquid surface chemistry more versatile and controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 4&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; Disubstituted CinNapht Dyes Accessible through Double SNAr Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the synthesis of a difluorinated CinNapht derivative in the 4' and 5' positions allowing the easy access to two new families of fluorophores by late&#8208;stage functionalization using SNAr. The first one comprises derivatives incorporating hindered aromatic amines in the 4' and 5' positions, which show redemission in apolar solvents. The second one is obtained through the use of dinucleophiles. Among them, Tetrahydroquinoxaline (THQ) and tetrahydrobenzodiazepine (THB) compounds show strongly redshifted emission. The photophysical properties of all the fluorophores in these two families are studied and rationalized by DFT and TDDFT calculations. The most promising compounds have been used to image living cells by confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution of the axial Type 1 Cu Ligand Afford Binding of a Water Molecule in Axial Position Affecting Kinetics, Spectral, and Structural Properties of the Small Laccase Ssl1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicopper oxidases use Cu ions as cofactors to oxidize various substrates. High reduction potential at Type 1 Cu is considered as crucial for effective catalysis. Previous studies have shown that replacing the axial methionine ligand of the Type 1 Cu with leucine or phenylalanine leads to an increased reduction potential, but not always to higher enzyme activity. Here we present a study of six variants of the small laccase Ssl1 from Streptomyces sviceus, where the axial methionine ligand was substituted and the effect of the axial ligand on reduction potential, activity, spectral properties and structure was investigated. Absorption, electronic circular dichroism and EPR spectra revealed the presence of a stronger coordinating axial ligand like oxygen, which influences the electronic and catalytic properties more than the nature of the amino acid side chain. The crystal structures of the Ssl1 variants were solved, which show that none of the amino acids side chains coordinates to the Cu. Instead, a water molecule is found in the axial coordination site, which support the spectroscopic data. Our findings highlight the importance of combining structural and spectroscopic methods to investigate the effect of amino acid exchange on multicopper oxidases.</dc:description>

         <title>Changes in Secondary Structure upon Pr to Pfr Transition in Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Cph1 detected by DNP NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytochromes perceive subtle changes in the light environment and convert them into biological signals by photoconversion between the red&#8208;light absorbing (Pr) and the far&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing (Pfr) states. In the primitive bacteriophytochromes this includes refolding of a tongue&#8208;like hairpin loop close to the chromophore, one strand of an antiparallel&#160;b&#8208;sheet&#160;being replaced by&#160;&#945;&#8208;helix. However,&#160;the strand sequence in the&#160;cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1&#160;is different from that of previously investigated bacteriophytochromes and has a higher&#160;b&#8208;sheet&#160;propensity. We&#160;confirm here the transition experimentally and estimate minimum helix length using&#160;dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) magic angle spinning NMR. Sample conditions were optimized for protein DNP NMR studies at high field, yielding Boltzmann enhancements&#160;eB&#160;of 19 at an NMR field of 18.801 T. Selective labelling of Trp, Ile, Arg, and Val residues with&#160;13C and&#160;15N enabled&#160;filtering for pairs of labelled amino acids by the 3D CANCOCA technique to identify signals of the motif&#160;483Ile&#8208;Val&#8208;Arg485&#160;(IVR) present in both sheet and helix. Those signals were assigned for the Pfr state of the protein. Based on the chemical shift pattern, we confirm for Cph1 the formation of a helix covering the IVR motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution Enhances Kemp Eliminase Activity by Optimizing Oxyanion Stabilization and Conformational Flexibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The base&#8208;promoted Kemp elimination reaction has been used as a model system for enzyme design. Among the multiple computationally designed and evolved Kemp eliminases generated along the years, the HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary trajectory is particularly interesting due to the high catalytic efficiency of HG3.17 and the debated role of glutamine 50 (Gln50) as potential oxyanion stabilizer. This study aims to elucidate the structural and dynamic changes along the evolutionary pathway from HG3 to HG3.17 that contribute to improved catalytic efficiency. In particular, we evaluate key variants along the HG3 evolutionary trajectory via molecular dynamics simulations coupled to non&#8208;covalent interactions and water analysis. Our computational study indicates that HG3.17 can adopt a catalytically competent conformation promoted by a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, in which aspartate 124 is properly positioned for proton abstraction and both glutamine 50 and mutation cysteine 84 contribute to oxyanion stabilization. We find that HG3.17 exhibits a rather high flexibility of Gln50, which is regulated by the conformation adopted by the active site residue Trp44. This interplay between Gln50 and Trp44 positioning induced by distal active site mutations affects the water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, Gln50 preorganization, and water content of the active site pocket.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selectively Phosphorylated Hsp90 C&#8208;terminal Domain Variants Provide Access to Deciphering the Chaperone Code.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is pivotal in many cellular processes through folding of client proteins under stressed and normal conditions. Despite intensive research on its function as a chaperone, the influence of posttranslational modifications on Hsp90 (the &#8216;chaperone code&#8217;), and its interactions with co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins, still remains to be elucidated. The C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 is essential for formation of the active homodimer state of Hsp90 and contains recognition sites for co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins. Here we used expressed protein selenoester ligation to introduce site&#8208;selective phosphorylations in the Hsp90 CTD, while preserving the native amino acid sequence. The two phosphorylations do not affect the overall secondary structure, but in combination, slightly decrease the thermal stability of the CTD. The Hsp90 CTD functions as a chaperone in decreasing aggregation of model client proteins, but the C&#8208;terminal phosphorylations do not significantly alter the anti&#8208;aggregation activity for these clients. The optimization of expressed protein selenoester ligation to carry out several steps in one pot provides an efficient route to access site&#8208;specifically modified Hsp90 CTD variants, allowing the generation of Hsp90 variants with site&#8208;specific PTMs to decipher the chaperone code.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond the Diffusion Limit: Pre&#8208;Associated Ion&#8208;Pair Photoinitiating Systems for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pre&#8208;association mechanism of an ion&#8208;pair Type II photoinitiating system (PIS) acting in the visible range was studied. The choice of a dye as photoinitiator (crystal violet) with an excited state lifetime of 200 ps ensured the absence of dynamical quenching by the borate salts used as coinitiators. In spite of the fact that no diffusional bimolecular quenching can take place, excellent polymerization efficiency was found, underlining the high reactivity of the PIS. A saturation effect is observed when increasing the concentration of borate as a consequence of the pre&#8208;association mechanism arising from coulombic interaction between the cationic dye and the anionic coinitiator. The association equilibria of the system were described and the corresponding association constant values were calculated, allowing to quantify the pre&#8208;association efficiency. This was further successfully correlated to the observed maximal rates of polymerization. The efficiency of this super&#8208;stoichiometric sample with an excess of borate was finally compared to the stoichiometric 1:1 dye:borate ion&#8208;pair. It is shown that the pre&#8208;association mechanism could lead to much higher efficiency than the stoichiometric ion&#8208;pair.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese(II) Porphyrin and Cumyl Hydroperoxide: An Efficient Catalyst for Aryl&#8208;Pentazole C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system composed of manganese(II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide was developed to afford the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion from aryl&#8208;pentazole in a 35.4&#8201;% yield over 4&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins and &#8901;CH3 radicals initiated C&#8722;N bond cleavage in aryl&#8208;pentazole selectively. Our findings provide a new perspective on radical&#8208;induced C&#8722;N activation for the preparation of other N&#8208;containing heterocycles.







Abstract
The selective cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in N&#8208;containing compounds holds significant research value in organic synthesis, particularly for the synthesis of promising polynitrogen species. For instance, the discovery of the cyclo&#8208;pentazolate (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) anion in 2017 as a result of cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond has sparked interest within the field of high energy density materials. However, previous methods using ferrous glycinate and m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid generated the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion in a low yield of 19.5&#8201;% after 24&#8197;hours, and the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we developed an efficient catalytic system comprising Mn (II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide. This system enables the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion to be produced from 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpentazole in 35.4&#8201;% yield in 4&#8197;hours. Characterization of Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins, &#8901;CH3, and &#8901;C8H8ON5 radicals provides evidence for the mechanism whereby the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion forms.

     alt="Manganese(II) Porphyrin and Cumyl Hydroperoxide: An Efficient Catalyst for Aryl-Pentazole C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient catalytic system composed of manganese(II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide was developed to afford the cyclo-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion from aryl-pentazole in a 35.4&#8201;% yield over 4&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Mn(IV)-oxo porphyrins and &lt;sup&gt;&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radicals initiated C&#8722;N bond cleavage in aryl-pentazole selectively. Our findings provide a new perspective on radical-induced C&#8722;N activation for the preparation of other N-containing heterocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-containing compounds holds significant research value in organic synthesis, particularly for the synthesis of promising polynitrogen species. For instance, the discovery of the &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-pentazolate (&lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) anion in 2017 as a result of cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond has sparked interest within the field of high energy density materials. However, previous methods using ferrous glycinate and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-chloroperoxybenzoic acid generated the &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion in a low yield of 19.5&#8201;% after 24&#8197;hours, and the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we developed an efficient catalytic system comprising Mn (II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide. This system enables the &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion to be produced from 3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenylpentazole in 35.4&#8201;% yield in 4&#8197;hours. Characterization of Mn(IV)-oxo porphyrins, &lt;sup&gt;&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sup&gt;&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;ON&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; radicals provides evidence for the mechanism whereby the &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion forms. Our study underscores the competitive potential of radical-initiated selective C&#8722;N bonds cleavage in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylazoles and opens avenues for further exploration in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formulation and Release of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Using a Supramolecular Self&#8208;Healing Two&#8208;Component Gel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was formulated with a variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) &#8208; APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation and release. The thixotropic atropine&#8208;loaded gel controlled the release of atropine over a period of hours, suggesting supramolecular gels have promise as a potential approach for treating myopia.







Abstract
A two&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) formed from a modified amino acid and an aldehyde was formulated with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Basic APIs (propranolol, atropine) can be mixed with the LMWG prior to gel assembly while acidic APIs (naproxen, rosuvastatin) inhibit assembly by disrupting the LMWG imine bond and were loaded by diffusion after gel assembly. For diffusion&#8208;loaded gels, the API in the liquid&#8208;like phase was rapidly released, with the remainder, interacting with gel fibres, retained in the gel. Rosuvastatin release was particularly low with Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR indicating interactions between the aromatic ring and the self&#8208;assembled gel network. Propranolol also interacted with the gel via its aromatic unit, and its release led to gel erosion. Using agarose as a polymer gelator additive reinforced the gel, restricting erosion. In contrast, atropine was readily released over a period of hours &#8208; it is primarily in the liquid&#8208;like phase with STD NMR indicating no interactions with the gel network. The atropine&#8208;loaded gel retained its thixotropic properties. Overall, APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation/release. Of the APIs investigated, atropine has most potential for further development. Atropine has applications in treating myopia, and our results suggest potential ophthalmic applications of supramolecular gels.

         <title>Gallatabenzene Ligands Emerging from Open Lutetocene and Yttrocene Methyl Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Fully open metallocene (2,4&#8208;dtbp)2LuMe (I) is isolable and stable only at low temperatures and features a superbasic vital intermediate for subsequent ring&#8208;closure reactions. So accessible bis(gallatabenzene) complexes (1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Ln(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C5H3Ga) (Ln=Y, Lu (II)) exhibit almost planar metallacycles, while the respective aluminatabenzene chemistry follows distinct reaction pathways.







Abstract
Utilizing ternary mixtures [LnMe3]n/K(2,4&#8208;dtbp)/GaMe3 (Ln=Lu, Y; 2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl), a series of metallacycles is accessible via tandem salt metathesis/deprotonation. Depending on the precursor molar ratio, both gallatabenzene and lutetacyclic moieties with fully planar metallacycles are obtained, which were further analyzed using DFT calculations. The precursor molar ratio affects the extent of pentadienyl C&#8722;H&#8208;bond activation and oligomerization to tetra&#8208; and pentametallic arrays. Reacting a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixture at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C gave the open sandwich methyl complex (2,4&#8208;dtbp)2Lu(CH3), displaying a vital intermediate for subsequent ring&#8208;closure reactions.

[1.1][n]Paracyclophanes ([1.1][n]PCPs) (3) with n=2, 3, and 4, which consist of two [n]paraphenylene units connected by methylene bridges, were synthesized using short synthetic pathways with good overall yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the paraphenylene unit in 3 is bent, resulting in an elliptic core structure of 3. The facing bridgehead carbons of the paraphenylene units are separated by a distance much shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculations were used to demonstrate the presence of through&#8208;space (TS) conjugation in 3. Furthermore, host&#8208;guest complex formation between 3D (n=3) and tetracyanoquinodimethane in the solid state was revealed.

         <title>Trace Amount of Ir Decorated NiFe Phosphide In&#8208;Situ Grown on Carbon Cloth as Cost&#8208;Effective Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace iridium modified NiFe phosphide (Ir&#8208;NiFePx/CC) was in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth by a simple wet chemical method, followed by a phosphorization post treatment at a relatively low temperature. The best&#8208;performing electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, shows excellent OER activity, with an overpotential of 190&#8197;mV for alkaline OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an ideal long&#8208;term stability over 90&#8197;h.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is a key constituent to establish the balance of cost and catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water electrolysis in the area of energy conversion and storage. NiFe phosphide decorated with trace amount of iridium (Ir) species in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth was prepared by a facile wet chemistry approach followed by a phosphorization post&#8208;treatment at a relative low temperature.

&lt;p&gt;Trace iridium modified NiFe phosphide (Ir-NiFeP&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/CC) was in-situ grown on carbon cloth by a simple wet chemical method, followed by a phosphorization post treatment at a relatively low temperature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost-effective electrocatalysts is a key constituent to establish the balance of cost and catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water electrolysis in the area of energy conversion and storage. NiFe phosphide decorated with trace amount of iridium (Ir) species in-situ grown on carbon cloth was prepared by a facile wet chemistry approach followed by a phosphorization post-treatment at a relative low temperature. The optimal electrocatalyst, Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NiFeP&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/CC, exhibits excellent OER activity, with an low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for alkaline OER, and a desirable long-term durability over 90&#8197;h. The outstanding OER performance stems from the structural evolution via phosphorization process, Ir decoration with more high-valence stated Ir&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; species, and tight connection between individual components of the electrode, which gives rise to the strong activity to the active sites and faster reaction kinetics in the alkaline OER process.

         <title>Elevating Nonlinear Optical Response Through D&#8208;Electron Modulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a nonlinear optical (NLO) modulation strategy through regulating electronic structure within metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and the minor variations in the coordination transition metal ions played a vital role in regulating of NLO performance. This approach provides a promising platform for investigating the intrinsic mechanisms of NLO activity modulation through both theoretical and experimental perspectives.







Abstract
Electronic structure and excited state behavior is of pronounced influence on regulation of nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Herein, a serials of transition metal ions bearing different d&#8208;electron numbers were in&#8197;situ coordinated within porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), creating NLO&#8208;responsive M&#8208;metal (metal=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) frameworks. It demonstrated that the NLO properties can be optimized with the increased occupancy of the d&#8208;shell, which enhances the degree of delocalization. Specifically, the full&#8208;filled (d10) electron configuration of Zn2+ stabilizes the electronic structure, combination with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* local excitation character of M&#8722;Zn, promoting charge transfer process and resulting in outstanding NLO properties. Moreover, parameters related to the nonlinear process (&#946;, n2, Im&#967;(3), Re&#967;(3) and &#967;(3)) of M&#8722;Zn are calculated to be higher than those of other materials, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work paves the way for NLO modulation based on electronic analysis and provides a promising approach for constructing high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

         <title>Modular Design and Self&#8208;assembly of pH&#8208;Responsive Multidomain Peptides Incorporating Non&#8208;natural Ionic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of acid&#8208;responsive peptide assembly incorporating non&#8208;natural ionic amino acids is reported. The transition pH of these assemblies is dictated by the hydrophobic microenvironment around the ionic residues and highly tunable in the weakly acidic range. These materials demonstrate great potential for the development of acid&#8208;activatable antimicrobial therapy.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides, particularly pH&#8208;responsive variants, hold significant promise in biomedical and technological applications by leveraging the broad pH spectrum inherent to biological environments. However, the limited number of natural pH&#8208;responsive amino acids within biologically relevant pH ranges presents challenges for designing rational pH&#8208;responsive peptide assemblies. In our study, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating a library of non&#8208;natural amino acids featuring chemically diverse tertiary amine side chains. Hydrophobic and ionic properties of these non&#8208;natural amino acids facilitate their incorporation into the assembly domain when uncharged, and electrostatic repulsion promotes disassembly under lower pH conditions. Furthermore, we observed a direct relationship between the number of substitutions and the hydrophobicity of these amino acids, influencing their pH&#8208;responsive properties and enabling rational design based on desired transitional pH ranges. The structure&#8208;activity relationship of these pH&#8208;responsive peptides was evaluated by assessing their antimicrobial properties, as their antimicrobial activity is triggered by the disassembly of peptides to release active monomers. This approach not only enhances the specificity and controllability of pH responsiveness but also broadens the scope of peptide materials in biomedical and technological applications.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Complex as a Pre&#8208;Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pre&#8208;targeting strategy that combines host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept was developed to enhance cancer immunotherapy. After binding to the target site, rituximab&#8208;adamantane conjugates self&#8208;assemble with rhamnose&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form rituximab&#8208;rhamnose complexes. These complexes significantly amplify Fc effector function by recruiting endogenous anti&#8208;rhamnose antibodies.







Abstract
Enhancing the Fc effector functions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we present a novel pre&#8208;targeting approach that integrates host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept to create mAbs with superior effector functions. Using rituximab (RTX), a clinically approved anti&#8208;CD20 mAb, as our model, we modified RTX by conjugating it with adamantane (Ada) derivatives and various polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to produce RTX&#8208;Ada conjugates. These conjugates effectively formed RTX&#8208;rhamnose (Rha) complexes in&#8197;situ through self&#8208;assembly, driven by host&#8208;guest interactions with Rha&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This mechanism successfully redirected endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to target cells, enhancing the availability of Fc domains for improved effector functions, including complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). A structure&#8208;activity relationship study indicated that the potency of these in&#8197;situ complexes was significantly influenced by the length of the PEG linker used; shorter PEG linkers correlated with higher CDC activity. Given the variability in endogenous antibody levels among individuals, this strategy presents a flexible and promising platform for enhancing the efficacy of mAb&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogenation of an Insulated Diarylacetylene Dimer Incorporated as Axle Molecules in a Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane was synthesized for the first time through the simultaneous hydrogenation of both diarylacetylene moieties within a pre&#8208;prepared [c2]daisy chain rotaxane. This study demonstrates that [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo chemical modification owing to their unique structural features, thereby advancing the development of functional interlocked molecules.







Abstract
The [c2]daisy chain rotaxane is an attractive interlocked molecule for the development of functional materials because of its unique mechanical properties that respond to various external stimuli, resulting in extension and contraction motions along the molecular axis. The synthesis of several &#8216;impossible&#8217; [2]rotaxanes that do not exhibit obvious binding motifs between their axle and wheel moieties has been achieved through further chemical modification of their axle moieties within pre&#8208;prepared [2]rotaxanes. However, no &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane has been synthesized using similar strategies until now. In this study, we investigated the hydrogenation of diarylacetylene moieties within a permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PM &#945;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based [c2]daisy chain rotaxane using Pd/C or Pd/CaCO3 under hydrogen. A new [c2]daisy chain rotaxane featuring two diarylethane moieties was successfully synthesized through the simultaneous full hydrogenation of the insulated diarylacetylene moieties under optimized conditions. The new rotaxane is classified as an &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane due to the lack of obvious binding motifs between diarylethane and the PM &#945;&#8208;CD. This work demonstrates for the first time that the insulated axle moieties of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo novel chemical modifications using a synthetic strategy employing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation, which can potentially advance the development of nanoarchitectures with functional interlocked molecules.

The new rotaxane is classified as an &#8216;impossible&#8217; [&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;2]daisy chain rotaxane due to the lack of obvious binding motifs between diarylethane and the PM &#945;-CD. This work demonstrates for the first time that the insulated axle moieties of [&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo novel chemical modifications using a synthetic strategy employing transition metal-catalyzed hydrogenation, which can potentially advance the development of nanoarchitectures with functional interlocked molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pure Shift NMR in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure shift NMR provides highly resolved spectra that are very useful for the analysis of mixtures. Standard pure shift NMR methods are, however, not compatible with sample motion, and thus with the broad range of applications that involve a flowing sample. We show that high quality pure shift NMR spectra can be obtained for a continuously flowing sample, and illustrate the approach with the online monitoring of a tosylation reaction.







Abstract
Flow NMR is an expanding analytical approach with applications that include in&#8208;line analysis for process control and optimisation, and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D 1H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying 1H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position&#8208;dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity&#8208;compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.

         <title>Unveiling the Ultrafast Excitation Energy Transfer in Tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;BODIPY Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dyads comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY are synthesized. Fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE~99.9&#8201;%) are observed in both the dyads. Ultrafast spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 show TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (kET=8.0&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far.







Abstract
We have synthesized two dyads (dyad&#8197;1 and 2) comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY. In dyad&#8197;1, two BODIPYs are directly connected with TAPP moiety whereas in dyad&#8197;2, BODIPYs are connected through phenylethynyl linkers. TAPP is a blue energy donor which is easy to synthesize and functionalize as compared to other well&#8208;known blue energy donors like pyrene, perylene etc. This is the first report of using TAPP as an energy donor in BODIPY based dyad molecules. Complete quenching of TAPP fluorescence in the dyads suggests fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE~99.9&#8201;%). Ultrafast fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 showed TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (kET=8.0&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far. Whereas, in dyad&#8197;2, energy transfer is almost four times slower (480&#8197;fs, kET=2.1&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1). These results were rationalized by theoretical F&#246;rster formulations. This study shows that suitably matched optical properties of TAPP and BODIPY dyes along with their easy syntheses will be the key to develop highly efficient energy transfer systems in future for multiple applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds via Alkyne Benzannulation on Zigzag&#8208;Edged Dibenzochrysene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on zigzag&#8208;edged dibenzochrysene derivatives to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. Moreover, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized dibenzochrysene derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds.







Abstract
Organic dyes are interesting building blocks for the preparation of organic semiconductors as they possess synthetic handles that can be used to functionalize them and, consequently, change their electronic properties. However, reactions to extend their &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework through ring annulation have only been scarcely tested. Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene (vat orange 3) and 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene (vat orange 1) to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. More surprisingly, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds. Absorption spectroscopy reveals that ring annulation on both 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene and 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene resulted in a decrease of 0.38 and 0.12&#8197;eV in bandgap values, respectively, despite inducing a contorted conformation.

         <title>Heterogenization of Palladium Trimer and Nanoparticles Through Polymerization Boosted Catalytic Efficiencies in Recyclable Coupling and Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) and their derived palladium nanoparticles (3) are synthesized by concise free radical polymerization method. They show much superior catalytic activities than their monomeric precursors in the SMCC and 4&#8208;nitrophenol reduction reactions. This work enlightens that the immobilization of tri&#8208;palladium clusters or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency and recyclability.







Abstract
The development of heterogeneous palladium catalysts has shown continuous vitality in the field of catalysis and materials. In this work, we report one concise free radical polymerization approach to accomplish the aromatic palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) and its derived palladium nanoparticles (3). Full characterizations could confirm the successful combination of cationic [Pd3]+ or nanoparticles with poly(p&#8208;sulfonated styrene) skeleton. Compared to their monomeric tri&#8208;palladium precursor (1) and common Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, heterogeneous PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) shows much superior catalytic activities (0.15&#8197;mol&#8201;%, TOF=1333.3&#8197;h&#8722;1) in the SMCC reaction. The identically ligated PdNPs (3) are formed in&#8208;suit in the presence of NaBH4 and accomplish quantitative reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol in just 320&#8197;s (0.50&#8197;mol&#8201;%, TOF=2250&#8197;h&#8722;1). Moreover, these heterogeneous catalysts are reused for 5&#8211;6 times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Their superior catalytic ability is probably attributed to the synergistic effect of polymer entanglement and the tri&#8208;palladium fragment. This work enlightens that the immobilization of palladium clusters or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency and recyclability for their involved catalyses and show far&#8208;reaching future implications.

         <title>Preferential Formation of Three&#8208;layered Host&#8211;Guest Complexes of a Planar Dinuclear Metallohost with Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;layered 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 (host/guest) complexes were preferentially formed by the complexation of a dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+), whereas 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes were formed with Na+. The three&#8208;layered complexes have a unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost.







Abstract
We synthesized a planar macrocyclic dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost from the corresponding macrocyclic imine ligand containing two N2O2 chelate coordination sites and an O6 cation binding site like 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as well as peripheral hexyl groups. Due to the lipophilic nature of the hexyl groups, the metallohost was soluble in less polar media where its interaction with alkali metal ions was enhanced. The binding studies by NMR spectroscopy clearly showed its strong tendency to form multi&#8208;layered structures. The metallohost formed 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (host/guest) complexes with Na+ with the two&#8208;step binding constants of logK1=6.6 and logK2=3.0. In contrast, its complexation with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) preferentially gave 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 (host/guest) complexes when 2/3 equiv. of the guest was present. The three&#8208;layered structures of these 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 complexes were well characterized by mass spectrometry and 2D COSY/ROESY experiments as well as DFT calculations, elucidating their unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost. Therefore, the three&#8208;layered structures were preferentially formed when larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) were complexed with the metallohost.

         <title>Manipulation of Supramolecular Chirality in Bicontinuous Networks of Bent&#8208;Shaped Polycatenar Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The subtle interplay between space filling and interhelix interaction of a new type of soft bent&#8208;core polycatenar molecules induces the spontaneous supramolecular chirality generation and removal upon alkyl chain volume expansion by the reformation of meso&#8208;structure Ia3d with tighter lattice.







Abstract
Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (LC) phases are of particular interest due their possible applications in electronic devices and special supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of first examples of achiral bent&#8208;shaped polycatenar dimers, capable of displaying mirror symmetry breaking in their cubic and isotropic liquid phases. The molecules have a taper&#8208;shaped 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzoate segment connected to rod&#8208;like building unit terminated with one terminal flexible chain. The two segments were connected using an aliphatic spacer with seven methylene units to induce bending of the whole structure.

         <title>O&#8208;p&#8208;Methoxyphenyl &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids as Versatile Hydroxyalkylation Agents for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals are useful building blocks for photocatalysis. Despite the intensive research on &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals have never received comparable attention. Herein we present O&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl (PMP) &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as easy to prepare, bench&#8208;stable and synthetically highly flexible radical precursors. Next to their synthesis, we describe their application in five different photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
Reliable radical precursors are crucial for photocatalytic processes. In particular, heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals have attracted considerable research interest in photocatalysis. Among them, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals have received the most attention, while the research on &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals is much less developed. Herein, we present O&#8208;PMP &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as novel precursors for the formation of oxygen&#8208;stabilized radicals. These radicals have been successfully used as building blocks in Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylation reactions, Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylation and alkenylation reactions, and Giese reactions. A subsequent deprotection step liberates the corresponding hydroxyalkylation products.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) are promising for separation processes due to their tunable properties and enhanced performance. This review covers the methodologies, challenges, and applications of characterizing MMMs using Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It highlights the principles, challenges, and future directions in using these techniques to optimize MMMs for various applications.







Abstract
Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have emerged as promising materials for various separation processes due to their tunable properties, enhanced separation performance and reproducibility. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, challenges, and applications associated with the characterization of MMMs using two advanced imaging techniques: Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We begin by outlining the principles and capabilities of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, emphasizing their suitability for studying the microstructure, morphology, and composition of MMMs at nanoscale resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the specific challenges and limitations encountered in the characterization of MMMs using these techniques, including sample preparation, image acquisition, and data interpretation. Furthermore, we review the diverse applications of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM in elucidating the structure&#8208;property relationships of MMMs. Through illustrative examples, we highlight the valuable insights gained from these imaging techniques in optimizing MMMs for various separation applications. Finally, we propose future directions and emerging trends in MMM characterization, including the integration of lasers into FIB&#8208;SEM and in&#8197;situ characterization techniques, to address current challenges and push the boundaries of MMM design and performance. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for characterizing MMMs using FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, identifies key challenges, and offers insights into future research directions aimed at harnessing the full potential of MMMs for sustainable separation technologies.

         <title>Ionomeric Binders for High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binder materials is responsible for the mass transport of the catalyst layer for HT&#8208;PEMFCs. A detailed discussion of various binders with different molecular structures is described. In addition, we provide the development directions for different binders aiming at reducing the Pt loading and mitigating the PA poisoning.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) based on phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane (PBI/PA) operating at 120&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C can provide insensitivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and simplified managements of water and heat and thus attract significant global attention. However, one significant drawback is its low utilization of precious metal catalysts resulted from the PA poisoning and inefficient three&#8208;phase boundary. Studies of binder materials in catalyst layers for HT&#8208;PEMFC are gradually emerging and there are few literature reviews on this important topic. The purpose of this review is to describe the various types of binders based on their molecular structure and electrochemical properties, with particular emphasis on catalyst layer for fuel cells. Importantly, this review provides a better understanding of relationship between fuel cell performance and the gas permeability and conductivity of different binders. Then, future directions of research and development in binder materials of HT&#8208;PEMFC are pointed out.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions with Guanidino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New redox&#8208;active diguanidines are prepared, with the aim to optimize their proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer properties. Then, their oxidized, dicationic redox states are applied in dehydrogenative coupling reactions, with radical cation (electron transfer) or arenium&#8208;ion like (proton transfer) mechanisms. The molecules emerge as valuable (and in some cases superior) alternatives to traditionally applied benzoquinones such as DDQ.







Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) reactions are of importance for the construction of new carbon&#8208;element bonds in synthetic organic chemistry. In this work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of several redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecules (GFAs) for use in DC (C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O) reactions. In a systematic approach, we first characterize the new DC reagents in all relevant redox and protonation states, and compare their performance in competitive test proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Then, their use in four different DC reactions with different mechanisms is evaluated.

         <title>Widening the Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness of Aqueous Biphasic Systems by Changing the Ionic Liquid Cation Basicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate the formation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus. This was achieved with ABS formed by mono or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity, presenting high impact in the design of more sustainable separation processes.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate the formation of new stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus, therefore allowing the design of more sustainable separation processes. This dual behavior is achieved with ABS formed by mono&#8208; or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity. While ABS comprising monocationic ionic liquids only respond to the effect of temperature, systems comprising dicationic ionic liquids are simultaneously affected by both temperature and pH variations. Dicationic ionic liquids are here identified as the key to unlock a double response to stimuli, which is due to the presence of two pKa values afforded by the cation. The reported findings contribute to increase the customizability of double stimuli&#8208;responsive ABS based on ionic liquids, whose development was up to date limited to ionic liquids bearing pH&#8208;responsive anions, opening the door towards the development of more sustainable separation processes.

         <title>Bispecific Thio&#8208;linked Disaccharides as Inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectins LecA (PA&#8208;IL) and LecB (PA&#8208;IIL): Dual&#8208;Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent opportunistic human pathogen, particularly associated with cystic fibrosis. Among its virulence factors are the LecA and LecB lectins. Both lectins play an important role in the adhesion to the host cells and display cytotoxic activity. In this study, we successfully synthesized hardly hydrolysable carbohydrate ligands targeting these pathogenic lectins, including two bispecific glycans. The interactions between LecA/LecB lectins and synthetic glycans were evaluated using hemagglutination (yeast agglutination) inhibition assays, comparing their efficacy with corresponding monosaccharides. Additionally, the binding affinities of bispecific glycans were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Structural insight into the lectin&#8208;ligand interaction was obtained by determining the crystal structures of LecA/LecB lectins in complex with one of the bispecific ligands using X ray crystallography. This comprehensive investigation into the inhibitory potential of synthetic glycosides against P. aeruginosa lectins sheds light on their potential application in antimicrobial therapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of stable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin&#8208;coating method, and the as&#8208;resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n&#8208;type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27 &#215; 10&#8208;3 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin&#8208;film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N&#8208;heteroacenes can be developed as promising air&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte for Electrosynthesis: Scalable Anodically&#8208;Enabled One&#8208;Pot Sequence from Aldehyde to Isoxazol(in)es</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic strategy, involving &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; generation, was developed. The concept of &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; for electrochemical transformations was demonstrated for the waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of high&#8208;value functionalized isoxazol(in)es. Chemical yields of up to 97&#8201;% are observed for a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Electrochemical transformations are considered a green alternative to classical redox chemistry as it eliminates the necessity for toxic and waste producing redox reagents. Typical electrochemical reactions require the addition of a supporting electrolyte &#8211; an ionic compound to facilitate reaction medium conductivity. However, this is often accompanied by an increase in the amount of produced waste. Here, we report an &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; concept for facile, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical preparation of isoxazol(in)es, important scaffolds for biologically active natural and synthetic molecules, from the respective aldehydes. The protocol utilizes no halogenated solvents and no external oxidants, while salt side&#8208;products provide the ionic conductivity necessary for the electrosynthesis. The electrolysis is performed in an undivided cell, using the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry dimensionally stable and scalable mixed metal oxide anode and platinized titanium cathode of high durability. The cascade transformation comprises the condensation of aldehyde to oxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent intra&#8208; and/or intermolecular [3+2] cycloadditions with an appropriate dipolarophile. Chemical yields up to 97&#8201;%, and good Faradaic efficiency, scalability, and stability are observed for most substrates in a broad scope.

The cascade transformation comprises the condensation of aldehyde to oxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent intra- and/or intermolecular [3+2] cycloadditions with an appropriate dipolarophile. Chemical yields up to 97&#8201;%, and good Faradaic efficiency, scalability, and stability are observed for most substrates in a broad scope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Supports for Oligonucleotide Synthesis: Controlled Pore Glass Derivatives with Branched Amine&#8208;Ended Polyether or Polyimine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled pore glass (CPG), differing in pore size and subsequent specific surface, was chemically modified by: (1) increasing surface susceptibility for amine functionalization via reaction with oxirane&#8208;type (active) and alkyl/aryl&#8208;type (inactive towards amine compounds) silane pro&#8208;adhesive compounds, and (2) immobilization of trimethylolpropane tris[poly(propylene glycol), amine terminated] ether, comb&#8208;like 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine] with each branch amine terminated, and a poly(propylene imine) amine&#8208;terminated second&#8208;generation dendrimer. The increase in surface density of amine functions&#8212;monitored by UV&#8208;Vis technique adopted for quantitative measurements of Ruhemann&#8217;s purple intensity&#8212;improved final loading capacity, characterized by dimethoxytrityl cation absorption. Obtained materials proved their applicability in automatic oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis, especially when silanized 2000 &#197; CPG modified with 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine], with deduced empirical formula CPG&#8212;silane&#8212;(NH)5.7PEG&#8208;(NH2)2.3, was used for long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotides) ONs synthesis. This can be regarded as a good CPG support for this purpose. Moreover, hybrid supports with different porosity allowed the synthesis of shorter ONs with satisfactory yield and purity, monitored by RP&#8208;HPLC and MALDI&#8208;TOF. On the molecular level, two competitive mechanisms seem to influence the utility of the final hybrid support: spatial availability of active sites and the propensity of the functionalizer to bond with the CPG surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Switch of Five Contiguous Chiral Centers in the Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of Hajos&#8211;Parrish Ketone Analogs via Diphenylprolinol Silyl Ether&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one&#8208;pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction. In the Michael reaction, depending on the solvent and water amounts, syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers were selectively synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity, in which the absolute configuration at C5 (indanone numbering) was opposite. The subsequent Henry reaction was diastereoselective, in which the C5 substituent controlled the three chiral centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The final base treatment in condition B caused epimerization, changing the stereochemistry at C6. Switching more than two chiral centers with high enantioselectivity is extremely difficult using the same chiral catalyst; the present reaction is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction that switches five continuous chiral centers with high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Azaspirocycles as RNA binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents efficient synthetic pathways for preparing novel azaspirocycles. These methodologies involve functionalizing key bicyclic hydrazines with a substituent on one of their bridgehead carbon atoms. The desired spirocyclic cores were successfully obtained through double reductive amination reactions, intramolecular cyclizations, and cleavages of the N&#8208;N bond. The isolated molecules possess unique three&#8208;dimensional structures, suggesting potential applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. With the growing interest in targeting nucleic acids as a complementary approach to protein&#8208;targeting strategies for developing novel active compounds, we investigated the potential of the synthesized azaspirocycles as RNA binders. As a proof of concept, we highlight the promising activity of some compounds as strong binders of HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanosized {NiII18} Cluster with a &#8216;Flying Saucer&#8217; Topology Exhibiting Slow Relaxation of Magnetisation Phenomena at Both 15 K and 1.3 K</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} complex (1) with a unique &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate, &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH), in conjunction with bridging azido (N3&#8208;) and peroxido (O22&#8208;) ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed the presence of both ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centres in 1, and the stabilization of spin states with appreciable S values at two different temperature regimes. The end&#8208;on bridging azido and alkoxido groups are in all likelyhood the ferromagnetic mediators, while the &#951;3:&#951;3:&#956;6&#8208;bridging peroxides most likely promote the antiparallel alignment of the metals&#8217; spin vectors, yielding an overall non&#8208;zero spin ground state for the centrosymmetric compound 1. Furthermore, the {Ni18} nanosized cluster behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet, exhibiting magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures and two relaxation processes at 15 K and 1.3 K, a very rare phenomenon in polynuclear magnetic 3d&#8208;metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Luminescent Terpyridine&#8208;Based Metallo&#8208;Bowties with Alkyl Chain&#8208;Bridged Dimerized Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous metallo&#8208;supramolecules with well&#8208;defined sizes and shapes have been successfully constructed via the strong coordination interaction between terpyridine (TPY) moieties and ruthenium cations. However, the pseudo&#8208;octahedral geometry of &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; unit hampers the luminescent properties of such metallo&#8208;architectures, thus limiting their applications as optical materials. To address this issue, we herein use a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, replacing conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into desired architecture while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects typically associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. More importantly, this design strategy enables the precise construction of bowtie&#8208;shaped metallo&#8208;supramolecules with significantly enhanced emission. The incorporation of alkyl chain linkage not only maintains structural integrity but also enhances optical performance, making these metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies highly promising for applications in advanced photonic and luminescent materials. This study offers a versatile approach to construct complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Quenching Rate Constants of Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radical by Substrates: a Laser Flash Photolysis Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced strategy using  Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBRs) has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full&#8208;carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8226; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro&#8208;substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, kq, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate&#8208;determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.</dc:description>

By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate-determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;step Macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;Macrocycle Conversion Towards Two New Macrocyclic Arenes with Different Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new macrocyclic arenes H1 and H2 were conveniently synthesized by the one&#8208;step reaction of carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. It was found that H1 was composed of three ethenoanthracene subunits with a rigid hexagonal structure and H2 contained two ethenoanthracene subunits and one anthracene subunit with a rigid house&#8208;shaped structure. Among them, H2 exhibited strong blue fluorescence due to the existence of an anthracene subunit. Moreover, both H1 and H2 showed large and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enable them to effectively complex different nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic salt guests in solution and the solid state. It was further found that H2 exhibited stronger complexation towards the tested guests than H1 probably due to the stronger charge&#8208;transfer interactions between H2 and the guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Contraction in Dicopper Paddle&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Enhance C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a balance between high selectivity and uptake is a formidable challenge for the purification of acetylene from mixtures with carbon dioxide, particularly when seeking to maximize both C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity in crystalline porous materials. In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate&#8208;based linkers and combined them with Cu2+ ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle&#8208;wheel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu&#8208;TPTC (terphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid , H4TPTC) and Cu&#8208;ABTC (3,3,5,5&#8208;azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H4ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu&#8208;ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu&#8208;TPTC. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;ABTC outperforms Cu&#8208;TPTC in terms of C2H2 adsorption capacity (196 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K and 1 bar) and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is greatly crucial to develop low&#8208;cost energy storage candidates with high safety and stability to replace alkali metal systems for a sustainable future. Recently, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have received tremendous interest owing to their low cost, high safety, wide oxidation states, and sophisticated fabrication process. Nanostructured manganese (Mn)&#8208;based oxides in different polymorphs are the potential cathode materials for the widespread application of ZIBs. However, Mn&#8208;based oxide materials suffer from several drawbacks, such as low electronic/ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance. To overcome these issues, various structural modification strategies have been adopted to enhance their electrochemical activity, including phase/defect engineering, doping with foreign atoms (e.g., metal and/or nonmetal atoms), and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers. Herein, this review targets to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the above&#8208;mentioned strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathodic part of ZIBs. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlining Thionyl Tetrafluoride (SOF4) and Pentafluoro&#8208;Oxosulfate [OSF5]&#8722; Anions Syntheses</title>

SuF&#8208;ficiently. The preparation of 100&#8197;mmol of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) by the direct S&#8722;F bond formation from fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) was achieved in a quantitative and convenient manner. The solid&#8208;state structure was elucidated, and the reagent fully characterized. This efficient SuFEx reagent was transformed using a fluoride salt in pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) anion that can behave as an SOF4 storage reagent. Tuning the solvent system, the stable OSF5 anion appears as reactive as SOF4 for the formation of sulfurimidoyl fluorides.







Abstract
A one pot room temperature synthesis of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) from elemental fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) is reported. The selective decagram scale process (100&#8197;mmol) allows a quantitative preparation of SOF4 with high purity. The solid&#8208;state structure has also been elucidated and compared with the reported gas phase one. The use of this reagent for the formation of the emerging pentafluorooxosulfate [cat][OSF5] anions led to the preparation of multiple ion&#8208;pairs (cat=Ag, NEt3Me, PPN, PPh4) in different organic solvents. The SuFEx reservoir ability of this anion was studied and by tuning the solvent system, the reactivity of pure thionyl tetrafluoride was observed using Ag[OSF5] in THF and acetone.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Copper Nanoparticles Supported on Carbon Nanotubes with Balanced Cu+ and Cu0 Dual Sites for the Selective Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles supported on surface modified carbon nanotubes with defects and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups catalysts were prepared via a convenient impregnation method. The 40Cu/CNTs catalysts revealed remarkable methanol and ethylene glycol yields for the vapor&#8208;phase hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate. The synergistic effect of Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites contributed to the satisfactory catalytic performance of ethylene carbonate hydrogenation.







Abstract
Cyclic carbonate hydrogenation offers an alternative for the efficient indirect CO2 utilization. In this study, a series of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported xCu/CNTs catalysts with different Cu loadings were fabricated using a convenient impregnation method, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate to methanol and ethylene glycol. The structural and physicochemical properties revealed that acid treatment of CNTs resulted in plentiful oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for copper species. The calcination process conducted under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of ternary CuO, Cu2O, and Cu composites, enhancing the metal&#8208;support interaction and facilitating the formation of balanced Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites as well as high active surface area after reduction. Contributed to the synergetic effect of balanced Cu+ and Cu0 species proved by density functional theory calculation and the electron&#8208;rich CNTs surface, the 40Cu/CNTs catalyst achieved strengthened catalytic performance with methanol yield of 83&#8201;%, ethylene glycol yield of 99&#8201;% at ethylene carbonate conversion of &gt;99&#8201;%, and 150&#8197;h of long&#8208;term running stability. Consequently, CNTs supported Cu serve as efficient non&#8208;silica based catalyst for ester hydrogenation.

&lt;p&gt;Cyclic carbonate hydrogenation offers an alternative for the efficient indirect CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization. In this study, a series of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported xCu/CNTs catalysts with different Cu loadings were fabricated using a convenient impregnation method, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate to methanol and ethylene glycol. The structural and physicochemical properties revealed that acid treatment of CNTs resulted in plentiful oxygen-containing functional groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for copper species. The calcination process conducted under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of ternary CuO, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and Cu composites, enhancing the metal-support interaction and facilitating the formation of balanced Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dual sites as well as high active surface area after reduction. Contributed to the synergetic effect of balanced Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species proved by density functional theory calculation and the electron-rich CNTs surface, the 40Cu/CNTs catalyst achieved strengthened catalytic performance with methanol yield of 83&#8201;%, ethylene glycol yield of 99&#8201;% at ethylene carbonate conversion of &amp;gt;99&#8201;%, and 150&#8197;h of long-term running stability. Consequently, CNTs supported Cu serve as efficient non-silica based catalyst for ester hydrogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The precise and accurate location of the hydrogen atoms in different B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Li linkages in three lithium m&#8208;terphenylhydridoborates was determined by Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) of standard single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the lithium m&#8208;terphenylhydridoborates [Li(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)BH3]2 (1), Li(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2BH2 (2) and Li(OEt2)(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2BH2 (3) are reported. Hirshfeld Atom Refinement (HAR) of the experimentally obtained molecular structures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography allowed the determination of the exact positions of the hydrogen atoms. The bond situations of the various B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Li linkages were investigated by a complementary bonding analysis using various methods including atoms in molecules (AIM), electron localizability indicator (ELI&#8722;D), non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) index and the compliance matrix.

         <title>Enhancing the Chemical Stability of P12L24 Cage: Transformation of the Chemically Labile Imine Cage into a Robust Carbamate Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. First, the imine bonds in P12L24 were reduced to form an amine&#8208;based cage, r&#8208;P12L24, followed by carbamation using N,N&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to yield c&#8208;P12L24. The resulting carbamate cage exhibits high stability under acidic and basic conditions (pH 1&#8211;13) and in the presence of moisture. 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, and DFT calculations revealed that reducing the imine bonds to amine increases the framework&#8217;s flexibility, causing partial structural collapse, whereas the carbamate formation restores structural rigidity. The insertion of a 4.0 nm molecular ruler into the cavity of zinc&#8208;metallated c&#8208;P12L24 via metal&#8208;ligand coordination further confirmed restoration of the cavity size and geometry of the original cage. This enhancement of chemical stability through carbamate formation can pave the way to a wide range of potential applications for the gigantic porphyrinic cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxydiazomethylation of Alkenes via Photoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Diazoesters belong to significantly important carbenoid precursors in synthetic chemistry. Diazomethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes is highly valuable but remain nontrivial. Herein, we reported a general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;oxydiazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. This process exploits photocatalyzed strategy to convert alkenes to &#947;&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters using &#945;&#8208;diazo iodonium salts as carbyne precursors, featuring wide substrate tolerance and broad late&#8208;stage diversi&#64257;cations. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of &#947;&#8208;carbocation&#8208;tethered &#945;&#8208;diazoesters plays a crucial role in trapping DMF and H2O to allow for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity Effects and Aggregation of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor Barbiturate Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Probed by Cross&#8208;Metathesis and ESI MS Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular environment around supramolecular bonding systems significantly affects their stability and the assembly of host&#8208;guest complexes, most prominent for hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8208;guest complexes are well&#8208;known in solution, typically forming a 1:1 molar ratio complex. However, within a polymer matrix, these complexes can form higher&#8208;order assemblies, deviating from the standard 1:1 complex, which are challenging to characterize and often require lab&#8208;intensive methods. In this study, a novel Hamilton receptor (H) was equipped with cyclopentene moieties and used as a host to form host&#8208;guest complexes (H&#8208;B) with allobarbital (B), followed by covalent crosslinking. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy titration experiments in different solvents and at various temperatures revealed that polar solvents containing additional H&#8208;bonding sites significantly reduce the formation of the 1:1 H&#8208;B complex, as indicated by a reduced association constant. Higher&#8208;order aggregates (HH&#8208;dimer, HHH&#8208;trimer) were subsequently detected via an alkene cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) reaction to fix the assemblies covalently, followed by analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). This two&#8208;step method, firstly via CM fixation followed by ESI MS, was extended to study the H&#8208;B model complex within a polyisobutylene (PIB) matrix, presenting a direct method to analyze the complex host&#8208;guest assembly in solvent&#8208;free (polymer) environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Defining the Synthetic Scope of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides by Quantifying Their Electrophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) was synthesised and structurally characterised. Kinetic studies of the nucleophilic additions of carbanions (reference nucleophiles) to oQMs were used to determine second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions (20&#160;&#176;C, DMSO) at the oQMs&#8217; exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. Analysing the kinetic data by the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N+E) revealed the Mayr electrophilicities E of the oQMs. The electrophilicities E of oQMs correlate linearly with Hammett substituent constants and experimentally determined reduction potentials Epred as well as with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs), which provides valuable tools for prediciting the reactivity of further types of oQMs. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr&#8217;s reactivity scales enables to predict novel nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs and can productively be used to prepare simple Michael adducts as well as 4+2 or 4+1 cyclisation products as demonstrated in this work by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflyl [18F]Fluoride as a Solution for Base&#8208;sensitive Late&#8208;stage Nucleophilic Aromatic 18F&#8208;Fluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 is the predominant radionuclide used to label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers. One outstanding challenge in nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination reactions is the sensitivity of precursors and catalysts for basic reaction conditions, which are necessary for the work&#8208;up of [18F]fluoride, resulting in limited reproducibility. Triflyl [18F]fluoride is a new [18F]fluoride source that allows freedom in choice of type and amounts of base and cryptand. The aim of the current work is to explore the scope and limitations of triflyl [18F]fluoride in the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic aromatic 18F&#8208;fluorination of various functionalized precursors, exploring reduced amounts of base and cryptand. The assessment allowed for the application of this new nucleophilic [18F]fluoride reagent to the successful radiosynthesis of boron, stannane, hypervalent iodonium ylide and phenol substrates bearing electron&#8208;deficient, &#8208;neutral and &#8208;rich functional groups as well as the clinically relevant PET tracers [18F]FPEB, [18F]mFBG and [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Push&#8208;Pull Pyridinic Photobases: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pH effect on the photophysics of three push&#8208;pull compounds bearing dimethoxytriphenylamine (TPA&#8208;OMe) as electron donor and pyridine as electron acceptor, with different ortho&#8208;functionalization (&#8211;H, &#8211;Br, &#8211;TPA&#8208;OMe), is assessed through steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques in DMSO/water mixed solutions and in water dispersions over a wide pH range. The enhanced intramolecular charge transfer upon protonation of the pyridine&#160;leads to the acidochromic (from colorless to yellow) and acido(fluoro)chromic (from cyan to pink) behaviours of the investigated compounds. In dilute DMSO/buffer mixtures these molecules exhibited low pKa values (&#8804; 3.5) and short singlet lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is by exploiting the aggregation phenomenon in aqueous environment that the practical use of these compounds largely expands: i) the basicity increases (pKa &#8776; 4.5) approaching the optimum values for pH&#8208;sensing in cancer cell recognition; ii) the fluorescence efficiencies are boosted due to Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE), making these compounds appealing as fluorescent probes; iii) longer singlet lifetimes enable Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer, paving the way for the application of these molecules as photobases (pKa* = 9.1). The synergy of charge and proton transfers combined to the AIE behaviour in these pyridines allows tunable multi&#8208;responsive optical properties providing valuable information for the design of new light&#8208;emitting photobases.</dc:description>

         <title>Flipping&#160;the Metalation of 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine: Steric Repulsion versus&#160;London Dispersion Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions, including the coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and the steric hindrance from substituents, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of metalation reactions. Here, we demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for &#8220;flipping&#8221; the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8208;H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3&#8208;functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the i&#8208;Pr3Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of direct ortho&#8208;metalation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Electrophilic Arene Amination: Rapid Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For decades, the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones, a crucial structural motif in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has relied heavily on costly noble metal complexes and structurally complex ligands. Despite considerable efforts from synthetic chemists, a mild, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, and cost&#8208;effective approach has remained elusive. This study introduces a robust, metal&#8208;free synthetic platform that leverages an innovative organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic arene C(sp2)&#8208;H amination strategy to efficiently produce a wide range of new and modifiable 2&#8208;quinolones. Moreover, this study allows ready synthetic access to novel 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones, uncovering new chemical spaces with significant potential for medicinal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Defluorinative Etherification between Unactivated Perfluoroarenes and Hydrobenzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluoroaryl ethers represent an important framework of biologically active molecules and materials. Owing to the strong bond dissociation energy of C&#8208;F bond, selectivity and other issues, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ethers from perfluoroarenes via the activation of C&#8208;F bond is challenging and underdeveloped, as compared to the well&#8208;documented C&#8208;O bond formation starting from aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. Herein, an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative etherification for the synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ether skeletons using hydrobenzoxazoles as phenol surrogate, has been reported. The substrate scope for this protocol is broad, with respect to hydrobenzoxazoles and perfluoroarenes, under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, challenging alkenyl and alkynyl substituted polyfluoroarenes could be successfully used as the coupling component for Pd&#8208;catalyzed etherification reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the reaction mechanism, which suggested that oxidative addition between polyfluorobenzene and Pd(0) constituted the ratedetermining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Derived Tetracarboxylate Featuring AIE Properties for Dual Ion Sensing and Mechanochromic Self&#8208;Erasable Writing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of multiple functions within a single fluorescent molecule provides a promising platform for developing versatile, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective materials with enhanced performance across diverse applications. In this study, we introduce TPEC, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate, which demonstrates multifunctional capabilities, including metal ion sensing and self&#8208;erasable writing. TPEC exhibits amphiphilicity in water, self&#8208;assembling into single&#8208;layer nanosheets with robust blue fluorescence. Notably, the aqueous solution of TPEC displays a fluorescence colorimetric response to Al3+ ions and fluorescence quenching in the presence of Fe&#179;&#8314; ions. Additionally, TPEC powders undergo fluorescence colorimetric changes under mechanical stimulation, enabling self&#8208;erasable writing on prepared paper. This study presents a straightforward strategy for the development of multifunctional luminescent materials based on the self&#8208;assembly of a single&#8208;component fluorophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Clickable Isotactic Poly(vinyl ether)s through Organocatalytic Stereoselective Cationic Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of the high reliability of click chemistry, polymers with clickable groups provide a useful platform for the rapid synthesis of polymer materials with diverse functionalities and architectures. However, the polymerization of clickable vinyl monomers with a concurrent regulation on tacticity remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful development of a stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8208;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst, which allows for the synthesis of alkyne&#8208;functionalized vinyl ether copolymers with high isotacticity (up to 90% m), controlled molecular weight, and variable content of C&#8208;C triple bonds. Further transformation of the pendant clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions and copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By virtue of the high reliability of click chemistry, polymers with clickable groups provide a useful platform for the rapid synthesis of polymer materials with diverse functionalities and architectures.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysed Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Mandelic Acid Esters and &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Derivatives from Commercial Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active mandelic acid esters represent a highly valuable class of building blocks in organic synthesis and recurrent motifs embedded in bioactive compounds and drugs. Herein, we provide an enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis based on Knoevenagel condensation/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis (DROH) sequence to the crude mandelic acids, which underwent a final esterification step to (R)&#8208;methyl mandelates. These products have been obtained in good to high overall yield and enantioselectivity, using commercially and widely available reagents and catalyst including aldehydes, phenylsulfonyl acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide, water and an epi&#8208;quinine&#8208;derived urea as the organocatalyst. Moreover, the versatility of the process has been demonstrated to prepare the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkoxy esters in highly enantioselective manner, when using primary alcohols in a domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) step. This system is a first example of non&#8208;enzymatic catalytic one&#8208;pot protocol which allows a straightforward asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable mandelic acid derivatives from aldehyde feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Supramolecular Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and Anderson&#8208;type Polyoxometalate through Covalent Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of unprecedented supramolecular complexes of covalently modified Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs) have been obtained and characterized in solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in aqueous solution using various techniques including 1H DOSY, 2D NOESY 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS). It has been demonstrated that the supramolecular assembly process can be modulated by different covalent modification modes of the Anderson POMs, giving rise to a new type of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD complexes featuring organic&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;rotaxane structures, which are in good contrast to those of POM/&#947;&#8208;CD with poly&#8208;rotaxane type structures. Moreover, it is delighted to find that these pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD exhibit stable chirality in aqueous solution, which has not been accomplished in previously reported POM/&#947;&#8208;CD assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>HOST&#8208;GUEST INTERACTIONS FACILITATED BY CHALCOGEN BONDING WITHIN SELENADIAZOLE FUNCTIONALISED PORPHYRIN NANOTUBES</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural rigidity of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP) has been utilised to prepare a robust novel porous coordination polymer of composition Cd2(TPyP)(sez)2 (TPyP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, sez = 1,2,5&#8208;benzoselenadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate). The coordination polymer may be described as a hexagonal porphyrin nanotube (PNT) and has the potential to bind guest molecules through chalcogen bonding. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) data indicate an internal pore diameter ~9 &#197; which represents ~35% of the crystal volume. Immersion of the PNTs in solvents such as DMSO and CS2 result in the incorporation of these molecules within the nanotubes with chalcogen bonding between host and guest. The crystallographic guest&#8208;inclusion investigations are complemented by solid&#8208;state 77Se, 13C, 113Cd and 2H NMR studies which provide insights into dynamic behaviour. The porosity of the crystals was further explored using gas adsorption experiments, indicating the reversible uptake of CO2, CH4, H2 and N2. Structure&#8208;function relationships are clearly established from complementary crystallographic, NMR and adsorption investigations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials composed by coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic linkers, encompassing two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures. Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), a special case of these species, are discrete molecular &#8220;capsules&#8221; with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures. Over the last two decades, MOFs and MOCs composed of organic perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) linkers have gained much attention due to their versatile properties, which can be further enhanced after incorporation into the frameworks. This minireview highlights recent progress in the construction and application of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination framework materials. The text offers an overview of the synthesis of P/PDI organic linkers, proceeds to their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8208; 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs, and then explores potential applications. These include sensing, photocatalysis, electrochemical devices as well as photothermal conversion and focus on the apparent structure&#8208;property relationships. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of P/PDI&#8208;derived coordination frameworks will be addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring ORR Activity in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts through Phosphorus Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed iron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon materials (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) represent promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), offering potential alternatives to noble metal&#8208;based benchmarks. In our study, we investigated the influence of phosphorus doping on the catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C. The experimental research demonstrate that the doping of phosphorus significantly enhances the ORR activity. Specifically, the resulting Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits high metal loading and excellent ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH with an onset potential of 1.00 V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864 V. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that phosphorus improves the electrocatalytic activity by activating O2 molecules and reducing the energy barrier (the hydrogenation reaction *OH&#8594;H2O) of the rate&#8208;determining step. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits promising application prospects as an air cathode in Zn&#8208;air batteries, delivering a high maximum discharge power density of 180.3 mW cm&#8208;2 and outstanding discharge specific capacity (758.8 mAh g&#8208;1Zn) at a discharge current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Radical Pairs: From Fleeting Intermediates to Isolable Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the design and comprehensive investigation of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8211;2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) radical ion pairs (RIPs) generated via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). We quantified the degree of SET in both solution and solid phases, utilising a suite of spectroscopic techniques including IR, EPR, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8211;XRD). Our findings reveal that the extent of SET is significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of the solvent (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene). The radical ion pair [(pMeOPh)3N]&#8226;+[DDQ]&#8226;&#8211; was unambiguously identified using EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and its structure was confirmed by SC&#8211;XRD. Detailed analysis indicates an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.</dc:description>

Our findings reveal that the extent of SET is significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents (MeO &amp;gt; tBu &amp;gt; Br) and the polarity of the solvent (MeCN &amp;gt; DCM &amp;gt; toluene). The radical ion pair [(pMeOPh)3N]&#8226;+[DDQ]&#8226;&#8211; was unambiguously identified using EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and its structure was confirmed by SC&#8211;XRD. Detailed analysis indicates an open-shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ortho Arylation of N&#8208;Aryl Amides and the Construction of Diagonal Tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;Doped Fulminenes via BBr3&#8208;Derived Dibromoboracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of biaryl amides, which are prevalent motifs in bioactive molecules, often necessitates lengthy and inefficient procedures. To address these limitations, catalytic C&#8208;H activation protocols have emerged, enabling the direct ortho&#8208;arylation of aryl amides. However, these protocols often suffer from issues such as lack of selectivity, reliance on stoichiometric oxidants, and the requirement for excess reagents and harsh reaction conditions. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel and highly selective protocol for the ortho&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. The high selectivity originates from the directed installation of BBr3 to form a boracycle, which then undergoes cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl halide. Our method offers significant advantages, including mild reaction conditions, excellent site&#8208;specificity, and scalability. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with a diverse range of readily accessible functionalized anilides and aryl iodides, as evidenced by 55 successful examples yielding products in the 30&#8211;95% range. Furthermore, our methodology surpasses conventional approaches by facilitating the one&#8208;pot selective diagonal diarylation of dianilides. This capability unlocks the construction of previously unattainable diagonal aryl systems, which serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;doped fulminene, two crucial compound classes in materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Odorant Binding Proteins Facilitate the Gas&#8208;Phase Uptake of Odorants Through the Nasal Mucus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have long been suggested to transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous environment of the nasal mucus. While the function of OBPs as odorant transporters is supported by their hydrophobic beta&#8208;barrel structure, no rationale has been provided on why and how these proteins facilitate the uptake of odorants from the gas phase. Here, a multi&#8208;scale computational approach validated through available high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy experiments reveals that the conformational space explored by carvone inside the binding cavity of porcine OBP (pOBP) is much closer to the gas than the aqueous phase, and that pOBP effectively manages to transport odorants by lowering the free energy barrier of odorant uptake. Understanding such perireceptor events is crucial to fully unravel the molecular processes underlying the olfactory sense&#160;and move towards the development of protein&#8208;based biomimetic sensor units that can serve as artificial noses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rare Case of Magnesium Alkyl Mediated CO&#8208;to&#8208;Alkoxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols can be produced by nucleophilic addition at the C=O functional group of ketones or aldehydes. Such C&#8208;C bond formations generally proceed smoothly and selective. In contrast, nucleophilic addition at carbon monoxide is considerably more complex and unselective due to the instability of polar metal acyl intermediates. Herein, we report a magnesium alkyl complex, stabilized with a dipyrromethenide ligand, and its reactivity with CO2 and CO. Whilst the reaction with CO2 gave the expected carboxylate, reaction with CO took a surprising course, resulting in an alkoxide by formation of three new C&#8211;C bonds in a single reaction. An intertwined experimental and computational approach sheds light on the unusual reactivity of a carbene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel based on tetraphenylethylene&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescence has been driven by its promising applications in the fields of sensors, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, designing mechanophores that can exhibit fluorescence changes under relatively low force remains challenging. In this study, a mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using a tetraphenylethylene derivative as a cross&#8208;linker, producing a dynamic covalent network that exhibits increased fluorescence under tensile stress. Based on controlled experimental studies and molecular modeling calculations, the fluorescence enhancement by external forces was attributed to the restriction of intramolecular motion in tetraphenylethylene by macromolecular chain orientation. In time&#8208;dependent experiments, due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds, the stress relaxation and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the gel at fixed strain occurred simultaneously, demonstrating the potential of this fluorescence as an indication of internal stress through aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type mechanophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Distance&#8208;dependent symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene dimers</title>

         <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the through&#8208;bond coupling strength on the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics and mechanism, three 9,10&#8208;bis((4&#8208;hexylphenyl)ethynyl)anthracene dimers with varying distances, viz., a single&#8208;bond linked dimer (0&#8208;dimer), a phenylene linked dimer (1&#8208;dimer) and a para&#8208;biphenylene linked dimer (2&#8208;dimer), were synthesized and studied systematically using steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy. Steady&#8208;state absorption spectra revealed that the electronic coupling strength decreased gradually with the increase of the inter&#8208;chromophore distance, and the transition of S0&#8594;S1 includes the dark charge transfer (CT) excitation. fs&#8208;TA spectra demonstrated that SB&#8208;CS could be conducted in both weakly and highly polar solvents for 0&#8208;dimer, but the SB&#8208;CS dynamics has a significant difference. In weakly polar solvents, SB&#8208;CS only produces the partial CT (PCT) state, but it could generate the CT state via the PCT state in highly polar solvent. In comparison, SB&#8208;CS is only proceeded in highly polar solvents in 1&#8208;dimer and 2&#8208;dimer to produce the CT state directly. These results demonstrate that the SB&#8208;CS dynamics is strongly dependent on the inter&#8208;chromophore electronic coupling, and the relatively strong electronic coupling is crucial for the occurrence of SB&#8208;CS in weakly polar environment that is commonly presented in photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Seeing double: the persistent dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure of drug resistant influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The currently circulating S31N variant of the M2 proton channel of influenza A is resistant to antiviral drugs. Recently, there has been a growing concern regarding the impact of the lipid environment on the structural features of the S31N variant. The native symmetry of the M2 tetramer remains controversial. Here we show that S31N M2 persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid preparations independent of the amount of solvating lipids up to at least 180 lipids per tetramer. NMR spectra clearly detect the characteristic resonances of the dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers of M2 (residues 18&#8208;60 or 18&#8208;62) reconstituted in lipids. NMR&#8208;based distance measurements indicate that two isoleucine residues with upfield shifted alpha carbon resonances, typical of extended conformations, are compatible with a particular side&#8208;chain rotameric state and helical backbone geometry. These chemical shifts are therefore compatible with the expected native transmembrane helical fold. Symmetry breaking at the pH sensing H37 residues, detected via peak doubling, is a stable feature of S31N M2 based on the reference strain Udorn/1972(H3N2). By contrast, the spectrum is dramatically altered for Columbia/2014/(H3N2) M2, which differs in sequence in the amphipathic helices. This highlights an allosteric coupling between the amphipathic helices and the pH sensing residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Open Sn Framework Structure Hosting Bi Guest atoms &#8211; Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structure of Na13Sn26Bi</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although several Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, no ternary compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi system has been described yet. In this paper we present the Zintl&#8208;phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open&#8208;framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms. An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5 eV. A comparison of the band structures with the related binary compounds Na5Sn13 and Na7Sn12 shows that only the perfectly charge balanced Na7Sn12 is a semiconductor whereas Na5Sn13 is metallic. The rather specific electronic situation in the ternary compound is traced back to the loosely bound Bi atom, which acts as a guest atom according to Bix@Na13Sn27&#8208;x&#8208;yBiy, with x=1 and y=0.27, capable to change its oxidation state and thus to uptake additional electrons to form a semiconductor.&#160;Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 is a rare example of an open framework structure of Sn atoms comprising Bi atoms in the cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10 eV [M(III) = Sc] and 3.65 eV [M(III) = Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3:2:9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskite based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (D&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4 kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy by Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes via Ultrasound&#8208;triggered CO release and ROS generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3 Br] Ph&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8226;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2 &lt; 1 &#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It&#160;focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes, exhibiting absorption in the NIR region (750&#8208;2500 nm), have been applied to various optical applications such as security marking, photovoltaic cells and chemotherapy of deep tissues in vivo. Electrochromic systems capable of switching NIR absorption are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. The development of organic&#8208;based materials is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility, however, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, several studies on organic electrochromic systems that allow ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption have been developed in recent years. In this review, we focus on redox&#8208;active well&#8208;defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states. We also address more sophisticated electrochromic systems that can modulate their properties in response to external stimuli such as light, heat, and electric potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#183;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#183;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3 and 3.00 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Electron&#8208;Transfer Driving Force in Photosynthetic Special Pair Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light excitation of a family of bimetallic ruthenium polypyridines with the formula [RuII(tpy)(bpy)(&#120583;&#8208;CN)RuII(py)4L]n+ (RuRuLn+), where L = Cl&#8211;, NCS&#8211;, DMAP and ACN, was used to prepare photoinduced mixed&#8208;valence (PI&#8208;MV) MLCT states as models of the photosynthetic reaction center. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy allowed to monitor photoinduced IVCT bands between 6000 and 11000 cm&#8211;1. Mulliken spin densities resulting from DFT and (TD)DFT computations revealed the modulation of the charge density distribution depending on the ligand substitution pattern. Results are consistent with PI&#8208;MV systems ranging from non&#8208;degenerate Class II to degenerate Class III, with electronic couplings between 1000 and 3500 cm&#8211;1.&#160;These findings guide the control electron localization&#8208;delocalization in charge&#8208;transfer/charge&#8208;separated excited states, like those involved in the photosynthetic reaction center.</dc:description>
