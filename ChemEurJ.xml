      <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a particularly informative method for studying protein structure and dynamics in solution; however, it is also one of the most time&#8208;consuming. Modern approaches to biomolecular NMR are based on lengthy multidimensional (ND) experiments whose duration grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. The experimental time may even be several days in the case of 3D and 4D spectra. Moreover, the experiment often has to be repeated in several different conditions, for example in order to measure the temperature&#8208;dependent effects in a spectrum (temperature coefficients, TCs). In this paper we propose a new approach that involves joint sampling of indirect evolution times and temperature. This allows us to measure TCs with 3D spectra in even less time than is needed to acquire a single spectrum using the conventional approach. We propose two signal processing methods that are complementary in terms of sensitivity and resolution: a) dividing the data into overlapping subsets followed by compressed sensing reconstruction, and b) treating the complete data set with a variant of the Radon transform. The temperature&#8208;swept 3D HNCO spectra of two intrinsically disordered proteins&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;osteopontin and CD44 cytoplasmic tail&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;show that our new approach makes it possible to determine TCs and their non&#8208;linearities effectively. Non&#8208;linearities, which indicate the presence of a compact state, are particularly interesting. We provide the complete package of data acquisition and processing software for this new approach.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8592;N&#8208;Incorporated Dibenzo&#8208;azaacene with Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Visible Transparency</title>
      <dc:description>Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semi&#8208;transparent opto&#8208;electronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39 eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856 nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41 nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380 nm to 760 nm. Thin films of QBNA&#8208;O exhibit the average visible transparency (AVT) of 78% at the thickness of 205 nm and 90% at the thickness of 45 nm. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) of QBNA&#8208;O display ambipolar transporting behavior with the electron mobility of 0.52 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and the hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 together with excellent air&#8208;stability. The selective NIR absorbing property and excellent charge transporting property imply that QBNA&#8208;O can be used to fabricate transparent organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>DpgC&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation of&#160; DPA&#8208;CoA: insights into the spin&#8208;forbidden transition and charge transfer mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a very strong oxidizing agent, most organic molecules are not oxidized in the presence of O$_2$ at room temperature because O$_2$ is a diradical while most organic molecules are closed&#8208;shell. Oxidation then requires a change in the spin state of the system, forbidden according to non&#8208;relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually rely on metal or redox cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of, at least, one oxygen atom into an organic substrate. However, some oxygenases do not require any cofactor, and the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes remains elusive. To fill this gap, here we study the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of&#160; 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) combining multi&#8208;reference calculations on a model system, with QM/MM calculations. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen. The characterization of the electronic states reveals that&#160; &#160;electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet&#8208;singlet transition. The enzyme plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water&#8208;wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations. Our results show that the stabilization of the singlet radical&#8208;pair between dioxygen and enolate is enough to promote spin&#8208;forbidden reaction without the need for neither metal cofactors nor basic residues in the active site.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Aminoglycoside Conjugation for RNA Targeting: Antimicrobials and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
Aminoglycosides are therapeutically useful antibiotics as well as very efficient RNA ligands. They are able to interfere with the translation process in prokaryotes upon binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) thus impairing protein synthesis. The ability of aminoglycosides to bind to various RNAs renders them a great source of inspiration for the synthesis of new binders with improved affinity and specificity toward several therapeutically relevant RNA targets. A description of the synthesis and application of aminoglycoside conjugates is reported in the Review by M. Duca et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;12273&#8197;ff.

Human NOTCH1 receptor contains 36&#8197;epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;like repeating domains, in which O&#8208;glycosylation status of the EGF12 domain regulates the interaction with Notch ligands.

Four EGF11 and five EGF10 modules were synthesized. The specific O&#8208;glycosylation states affected in vitro folding of EGF10 more than EGF11, while calcium ion had a larger effect on EGF11 folding.

      <title>Effect of Larger Pore Size on the Sorption Properties of Isoreticular Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with High Number of Open Metal Sites</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks with coordinatively exposed metal cations perform extraordinarily well in low&#8208;pressure sorption processes. CPO&#8208;54&#8208;Mn is isoreticular to the heavily studied CPO&#8208;27/MOF&#8208;74 materials. It has a honeycomb structure with a larger pore and the second highest number of open metal sites. The difference in pore size and chemical structure affects the behavior of the two isostructural compounds on adsorption of CO2, H2 and CO.







Abstract
Four isostructural CPO&#8208;54&#8208;M metal&#8208;organic frameworks based on the larger organic linker 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid and divalent cations (M=Mn, Mg, Ni, Co) are shown to be isoreticular to the CPO&#8208;27 (MOF&#8208;74) materials. Desolvated CPO&#8208;54&#8208;Mn contains a very high concentration of open metal sites, which has a pronounced effect on the gas adsorption of N2, H2, CO2 and CO. Initial isosteric heats of adsorption are significantly higher than for MOFs without open metal sites and are slightly higher than for CPO&#8208;27. The plateau of high heat of adsorption decreases earlier in CPO&#8208;54&#8208;Mn as a function of loading per mole than in CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Mn. Cluster and periodic density functional theory based calculations of the adsorbate structures and energetics show that the larger adsorption energy at low loadings, when only open metal sites are occupied, is mainly due to larger contribution of dispersive interactions for the materials with the larger, more electron rich bridging ligand.

      <title>An Apparent Umpolung Reactivity of Indole via [Au]&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation and Lewis&#8208;Acid Mediated Allylation</title>
      <dc:description>The possibility of sequential functionalisation of indole C2 and C3 in an umpolung fashion has been executed with a pre&#8208;designed substrate and choice of reagents. The developed method comprises of a gold&#8208;catalysed alkynol cycloisomerization/ intramolecular addition of C2 of indole and subsequent BF  3  .OEt  2  mediated regioselective C3 allylation, resulting in the synthesis of the functionalized indoloisoquinolinone scaffold. The reaction involves 5&#8208;  endo  &#8208;alkynol cycloisomerization and the dearomative/ addition of indole C2 to the intermediate oxocarbenium cation, which results in two equilibrating fused and spiro pentacyclic intermediates which upon treatment with allylsilane in the presence of BF  3  .OEt  2  , undergo selective indole C3 allylation. Other nucleophiles such as hydride, azide and indole were also found to be compatible in this process.</dc:description>

The reaction involves 5&#8208;  endo  &#8208;alkynol cycloisomerization and the dearomative/ addition of indole C2 to the intermediate oxocarbenium cation, which results in two equilibrating fused and spiro pentacyclic intermediates which upon treatment with allylsilane in the presence of BF  3  .OEt  2  , undergo selective indole C3 allylation. Other nucleophiles such as hydride, azide and indole were also found to be compatible in this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Modulation of metallophilic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in platinum cyclometalated luminophores with halogen bonding</title>

      <title>On the Role of Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Like Superatom Al12P in Reduction and Conversion of Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <dc:description>Developing efficient catalysts for the conversion of CO  2  into fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance to relieve the growing energy crisis and global warming. With the assistance of DFT calculations, it is interesting to find that, different from Al  12  X (X = Be, Al, and C), the  alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;like superatom Al  12  P  prefers to combine with CO  2  via a bidentate double oxygen coordination, yielding a stable Al  12  P(  &#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) complex containing an activated radical anion of CO  2  (  i.e.  , CO  2  &#8226;&#8722;  ). Thereby, this compound can not only participate in the subsequent cycloaddition reaction with propylene oxide, but also initiate the radical reaction with hydrogen gas to form high value chemicals, revealing that Al  12  P can play an important role in catalyzing these conversion reactions. Considering that Al  12  P has been produced in laboratory, and is capable of absorbing visible light to drive the activation and transformation of CO  2  , we optimistically anticipated that this work could guide the experimentalists to discover such an additional superatom catalyst for CO  2  transformation, and open up a new research field of superatom catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Exciton Transport in Molecular Semiconductor Crystals for Spin&#8208;Optoelectronics Paradigm</title>
      <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is highly desirable for optoelectronics but currently remain rare. Here, we show the diffusion length of singlet excitons (LD) in 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA) crystals grown by solvent evaporation is up to ~124 nm. These crystals show a previously unseen parallelogram morphology with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer edge&#8208;on molecular stacking, isotropic optical waveguiding, radiation rate and non&#8208;radiation rate constants of 0.15 ns&#8208;1 and 0.26 ns&#8208;1 respectively, as well as good field effect transistor hole mobility and theoretically computed strong electronic couplings as high as 109 meV. Photoresponse experiments reveal that the photoconductivity of DPA crystals is surprisingly not related to the radiative pathway, but associated with rapid exciton diffusion to crystal surface for charge separation and carrier bimolecular recombination. Taken together, this study shows that DPA with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is a promising semiconducting material for new organic optoelectronics paradigm.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a systematic NMR&#8208;based study employing both  13  C&#8208;labelled and unlabelled glycosyl sulfoxide donors for the detection and monitorization of marginally populated intermediates. Our results conclusively show that glycosyl triflates play a key role in these glycosylations despite the presence of the acceptor alcohol. Importantly, the formation of covalent donor/acceptor sulfonium adducts has been identified as the main competing reaction, thus defining a non&#8208;productive consumption of the acceptor that could limit the reaction yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmable DNA Nanoflowers for Biosensing, Bioimaging, and Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flower of the flock: DNA nanoflowers consisting of DNA molecules and inorganic skeletons show flower&#8208;like morphology and porous structure. The DNA sequences and inorganic components can be designed in a predefined and programmable fashion, and eventually generate DNA nanoflowers with precise structures and synergistic functions, which can be widely applied in biomedical and related fields.







Abstract
DNA nanostructures have shown excellent prospects in biomedical applications owing to their unique sequence programmability, function designability, and biocompatibility. As a type of unique DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanostructures, DNA nanoflowers (DNFs) have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. Precise design of the DNA sequence enables the functions of DNFs to be customized. Specifically, DNFs exhibit high physiological stability and more diverse properties by virtue of the incorporation of inorganic materials, which in turn have been applied in an assortment of biomedical fields. In this review, the design, synthesis, and biomedical applications of programmable DNFs are discussed. First, the background of DNA&#8208;based materials and the fundamentals of DNFs are briefly introduced. In the second part, two synthetic methods of DNFs are categorized as the rolling circle amplification and salt aging method, focusing on the formation mechanism of DNFs and differences between the synthetic methods. In the third part, the biomedical applications of DNFs functional materials are summarized, including biosensing, bioimaging, and therapeutics. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities of DNFs are discussed toward more widespread applications.

      <title>Influence of Amide Connectivity on the Hydrogen Bond Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of [n.n]Paracyclophanes</title>
      <dc:description>Reported here is the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly characterization of [n.n]paracyclophanes (  [n.n]pCps  , &#160;n = 2, 3) equipped with anilide hydrogen bonding units. These molecules differ from previous self&#8208;assembling [n.n]paracyclophanes (  [n.n]pCps  ) in the connectivity of their amide hydrogen bonding units (  C  &#8208;centered/carboxamide vs.  N  &#8208;centered/anilide). This subtle change results in a ~30&#8208;fold increase in the elongation constant for the  [2.2]pCp  &#8208;4,7,12,15&#8208;tetraanilide (  [2.2]pCpNTA  ) compared to previously reported  [2.2]pCp  &#8208;4,7,12,15&#8208;tetracarboxamide (  [2.2]pCpTA  ), and a ~300&#8208;fold increase in the elongation constant for the  [3.3]pCp  &#8208;5,8,14,17&#8208;tetraanilide (  [3.3]pCpNTA  ) compared to previously reported  [3.3]pCp  &#8208;5,8,14,17&#8208;tetracarboxamide (  [3.3]pCpTA  ).

      <title>Chiral oligothiophenes with remarkable circularly polarized luminescence and electroluminescence in thin films</title>
      <dc:description>We report circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in thin films of self&#8208;organized oligothiophenes. Four new 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based oligothiophenes were ad hoc designed to ensure efficient spontaneous formation of chiral supramolecular order. They were easily synthetized and their chiroptical properties in thin films were measured. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra revealed glum in the order of 10&#8208;2 on a wide wavelengths range, originating from their self&#8208;organized chiral supramolecular organization. These molecules have reasonable properties as organic semiconductors and for this reason they can constitute the active layer of circularlypolarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Thus, we could investigate directly their electroluminescence (EL) and CPEL, without resorting to blends, but rather in a simple multilayer device with basic architecture.

      <title>Enhanced polysulfides adsorptions on CNTs/Boron Nitride fibers for excellent Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage system. However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we report a novel sulfur cathode by intertwining multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous boron nitride fibers (BNFs) for the subsequent loading of sulfur. This structural design enables trapping of active sulfur and serves to localize the soluble polysulfide within the cathode region, leading to low active material loss. Compared with CNTs/S, CNTs/BNFs/S cathodes delivered a high initial capacity of 1222 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C. Upon increasing the current density of 4 C, the cell retained a capacity of 482 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044% per cycle. The rational design of CNTs/BNFs/S gives new insights on how to optimize the cathode for the Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

      <title>What determines the selectivity of arginine dihydroxylation by the nonheme iron enzyme OrfP?</title>
      <dc:description>The nonheme iron enzyme OrfP reacts with L&#8208;Arg selectively to form the 3  R  ,4  R  &#8208;dihydroxyarginine product, which in mammals can inhibit the nitric oxide synthase enzymes involved in blood pressure control. To understand the mechanisms of dioxygen activation of L&#8208;Arg by OrfP and how it enables two sequential oxidation cycles on the same substrate, we performed a density functional theory study on a large active site cluster model. We show that substrate binding and positioning in the active site guides a highly selective reaction through C  3  &#8208;H hydrogen atom abstraction. This happens despite the fact that the C  3  &#8210;H and C  4  &#8210;H bond strengths of L&#8208;Arg are very similar. Electronic differences in the two hydrogen atom abstraction pathways drive the reaction with an initial C  3  &#8210;H activation to a low&#8208;energy  5  s&#8208;pathway, while substrate positioning destabilizes the C  4  &#8210;H abstraction and sends it over the higher&#8208;lying  5  p&#8208;pathway. We show that substrate and monohydroxylated products are strongly bound in the substrate binding pocket and hence product release is difficult and consequently its lifetime will be long enough to trigger a second oxygenation cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Lanthanoid Complexes as Molecular Materials: The Redox Approach</title>
      <dc:description>The development of molecular materials with novel functionality offers promise for technological innovation. Switchable molecules that incorporate redox&#8208;active components are enticing candidate compounds due to their potential for electronic manipulation. Lanthanoid metals are most prevalent in their trivalent state and usually redox&#8208;activity in lanthanoid complexes is restricted to the ligand. The unique electronic and physical properties of lanthanoid ions have been exploited for various applications, including in magnetic and luminescent materials as well as in catalysis.&#160; Lanthanoid complexes are also promising for applications reliant on switchability, where the physical properties can be modulated by varying the oxidation state of a coordinated ligand. Lanthanoid&#8208;based redox activity is also possible, encompassing both divalent and tetravalent metal oxidation states. Thus, utilization of redox&#8208;active lanthanoid metals offers an attractive opportunity to further expand the capabilities of molecular materials. This review surveys both ligand and lanthanoid centered redox&#8208;activity in pre&#8208;existing molecular systems, including tuning of lanthanoid magnetic and photophysical properties by modulating the redox states of coordinated ligands. Ultimately the combination of redox&#8208;activity at both ligands and metal centers in the same molecule can afford novel electronic structures and physical properties, including multiconfigurational electronic states and valence tautomerism. Further targeted exploration of these features is clearly warranted, both to enhance understanding of the underlying fundamental chemistry, and for the generation of a potentially important new class of molecular material.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Emission of Ultraviolet Light by Solid State Organic Fluorophores: Synthesis and Characterization of 1,4&#8208;Dialkeny&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>The design and development of organic luminophores that exhibit efficient ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in the solid state remains underexplored. Here, we report that 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;benzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes act as such UV&#8208;emissive fluorophores. The dialkenyldioxybenzenes were readily prepared in three steps from 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetylbenzene or 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diformylbenzene and via two to four steps from 1,4&#8208;bis(diethoxyphosphonylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene. The dial&#8208;kenyldioxybenzenes emit UV light in solution (  &#955;  em  = 350&#8211;387 nm) and in the solid state (  &#955;  em  = 328&#8211;388 nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution. In particular, the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes fluoresced in the UV region with high quantum yields (  &#934;  = 0.37&#8211;0.55) in the solid state. Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) doped with the adaman&#8208;tylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes also exhibited UV emission with good efficiency (  &#934;  = 0.27&#8211;0.45). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optical excitation of the dialkenyldimethoxy&#8208;benzenes involves intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the twisted alkenyl&#8211;benzene&#8211;alkenyl moiety, whereas the dialkenylbis(triphenylsiloxy)benzenes were optically excited through intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the oxygen atoms and twisted  &#960;  &#8208;system to the phenyl&#8211;Si moieties of each triphenylsilyl group.</dc:description>

      <title>Computational Mapping of Dirhodium(II) Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The chemistry of dirhodium(II) catalysts is highly diverse, and can enable the synthesis of many different molecular classes. A tool to aid in catalyst selection, independent of mechanism and reactivity, would therefore be highly desirable. Here, we describe the development of a database for dirhodium(II) catalysts that is based on the principal component analysis of DFT&#8208;calculated parameters capturing their steric and electronic properties. This database maps the relevant catalyst space, and may facilitate exploration of the reactivity landscape for any process catalysed by dirhodium(II) complexes. We have shown that one of the principal components of these catalysts correlates with the outcome (e.g. yield, selectivity) of a transformation used in a molecular discovery project. Furthermore, we envisage that this approach will assist the selection of more effective catalyst screening sets, and, hence, the data&#8208;led optimisation of a wide range of rhodium&#8208;catalysed transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Innovative Multipodal Ligands Derived from Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s Bases for the Sensitization of Lanthanide(III) Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of the first family of multipodal ligands with a Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework designed for the preparation of luminescent lanthanide(III) complexes. Eight ligands were designed and synthesized using different strategies, including alkylation reactions, amide couplings and Ugi multicomponent reactions. All ligands bear carboxylate groups for the coordination of the lanthanide(III) ion, with lanthanide(III) sensitizing units consisting of the Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework itself or attached benzamides. Upon irradiation of the chromophoric ligands, the green terbium(III) emission was efficiently generated, whereas the europium(III) emission signal was negligible. The geometry and the substitution pattern of the ligands allow the control of the stoichiometry of the species formed and the Tb(III) luminescence sensitization efficiency, showing that  para  &#8211;substitution patterns are more efficient than  meta  &#8211;substitution ones for the formation of coordination compounds with lower Tb(III)/ligand ratio.

      <title>Boosting the Iodine Adsorption and Radioresistance of Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs via Aromatic Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>Effective capture of radioactive iodine is of paramount importance for the safe and long&#8208;term storage of fission products in nuclear fuel cycle. Herein, a series of functionalized Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs was employed as a model to investigate the effects of substituents on iodine adsorption in both solution and vapor states. Sorption studies revealed that the electro&#8208;donating amino group exhibits the most positive role on increasing the removal rate of iodine from cyclohexane and the uptake capacity of iodine vapor. Particularly, the disubstituted Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2  can effectively remove 91.9% of iodine (300 mg/L) from cyclohexane and capture 969 mg/g iodine vapor, significantly higher than 59.6% and 334 mg/g of untagged Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, respectively. In addition, the substituent effect on the radiolytic stability of MOFs was for the first time investigated, leading to the unearthing of one of the most radioresistant MOFs Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  reported up to date.</dc:description>

Particularly, the disubstituted Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2  can effectively remove 91.9% of iodine (300 mg/L) from cyclohexane and capture 969 mg/g iodine vapor, significantly higher than 59.6% and 334 mg/g of untagged Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, respectively. In addition, the substituent effect on the radiolytic stability of MOFs was for the first time investigated, leading to the unearthing of one of the most radioresistant MOFs Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  reported up to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Multi&#8208;Photochromic Molecules Based on Dihydroazulene Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Switch back and forth: The switching properties of multi&#8208;photochromic molecules bearing two or three dihydroazulene (DHA) photoswitches can be fine&#8208;tuned by the nature of the bridging unit (azulene, thiophene, or benzene ring) separating the DHA moieties and by the substitution pattern of the DHA systems. (see figure, VHF=vinylheptafulvene)







Abstract
Multi&#8208;photochromic systems incorporating individually addressable switching units are attractive for development of advanced data storage devices. Here, we present the synthesis and properties of a selection of such molecular systems incorporating the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photo&#8208;/thermoswitch. The influence of the linker (meta&#8208;phenylene vs. azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl vs. thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) separating two DHA units on the switching properties was investigated. An azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl spacer largely inhibited both the DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerizations and the thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;reactions; the latter occurred ten times slower than for the related compound with a meta&#8208;phenylene spacer. A DHA trimer containing three DHA units around a central benzene ring was found to undergo stepwise DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerizations, whereas the thermal back&#8208;reactions occurred at similar rates for the three VHF entities. A meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged DHA dimer was subjected to further structural modifications at position C&#8208;1 of each DHA, having strong implications for the switching events, and synthetic steps for further functionalizations at position C&#8208;7 of each DHA were investigated. Finally, the molecular structure (from X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis) between the meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged DHA dimer and CuI is presented.

      <dc:description>Functional pairing between cellular glyco&#173;con&#173;ju&#173;gates and tissue lectins like galectins has wide (patho)physio&#173;logical significance.

      <title>PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS Block Copolymer Templated Mesoporous Carbons: A Comparative Study of Nitrogen and Sulfur Doping in the Oxygen Reduction Reaction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon materials slightly doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen (N&#8208;RFC) or sulfur (S&#8208;RFC) are investigated as active catalysts for the electrochemical bioelectronic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H  2  O  2  . Mesoporous carbons with wide, accessible pores were prepared by pyrolysis of a resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resin using a PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS block copolymer as a sacrificial templating agent and the nitrogen and sulfur doping were accomplished in a second thermal treatment employing 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and dibenzothiophene as nitrogen and sulfur precursors, respectively. The synthetic strategy allowed to obtain carbon materials with very high surface area and mesopore volume without any further physico&#8208;chemical post treatment.
Voltammetric rotating ring&#8208;disk measurements in combination with potentiostatic and galvanostatic bulk electrolysis measurements in 0.5 M H  2  SO  4  demonstrated a pronounced effect of heteroatom doping and mesopores volume on the catalytic activity and selectivity for H  2  O  2  . N&#8208;RFC electrode was employed as electrode material in a 45 h electrolysis showing a constant H  2  O  2  production of 298 mmol&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  (millimoles of H  2  O  2  divided by mass of catalyst and electrolysis time), with a faradic efficiency (FE) up to 61% and without any clear evidence of degradation. The undoped carbon RFC showed a lower production rate (218 mM&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  ) but a higher FE of 76 %, while the performances drastically dropped when S&#8208;RFC (production rate 11 mmol&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  and FE = 39 %) was used.</dc:description>

The undoped carbon RFC showed a lower production rate (218 mM&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  ) but a higher FE of 76 %, while the performances drastically dropped when S&#8208;RFC (production rate 11 mmol&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  and FE = 39 %) was used.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>How does iron storage protein ferritin interact with plutonium (and thorium) ?</title>
      <dc:description>The impact of the contamination of living organisms by actinide elements has been a constant subject of attention since the 1950s. But to date still little is understood. Ferritin is the major storage and regulation protein of iron in many organisms, it consists of a protein ring and a ferrihydric core at the center. This work sheds light on the interactions of early actinides (Th, Pu) at oxidation state +IV with ferritin and its ability to store those elements at physiological pH compared to Fe.&#160;
The Ferritin &#8208; thorium load curve suggests that Th(IV) saturates the protein (2840 Th atoms per ferritin) in a similar way that Fe does on the protein ring. Complementary spectroscopic techniques (Spectrophotometry, Infrared Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy) were combined with Molecular Dynamics to provide a structural model of the interaction of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) with ferritin. Comparison of spectroscopic data together with MD calculations suggests that Th(IV) and Pu(IV) are complexed mainly on the protein ring and not on the ferrihydric core. Indeed from XAS data, there is no evidence of Fe neighbors in the Th and Pu environments. On the other hand, carboxylates from amino acids of the protein ring and a possible additional carbonate anion are shaping the cation coordination spheres. This thorough description from a molecular view point of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) interaction with ferritin, an essential iron storage protein, is a cornerstone in comprehensive nuclear toxicology</dc:description>

      <title>Implanting Atomic Dispersed Ru in PtNi Colloidal Nanocrystal Clusters for Efficient Catalytic Performance in Electro&#8208;oxidation of Liquid Fuels</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the fact that PtRu alloy nanocatalyst has been certified to possess the excellent electrocatalytic performance and CO&#8208;poisoning tolerance toward the formic acid and methanol electro&#8208;oxidation, the unaffordable usages of ruthenium (Ru) and platinum (Pt) have greatly limited their widespread adoption. Here, we report a facile one&#8208;pot method to implant atomic dispersed Ru in PtNi colloidal nanocrystal clusters with different Ru/Pt/Ni molar ratios, which highly reduces the dosages of Pt and Ru, and further improves their catalytic performances for the electro&#8208;oxidation of formic acid and methanol. By simply controlling the amount of Ni(acac)2 precursor,&#160;trimetallic Ru0.3Pt70.5Ni29.2, Ru0.6Pt55.9Ni43.5,&#160;Ru0.2Pt77.3Ni22.5&#160;and Ru0.9Pt27.3Ni71.8&#160;CNCs are obtained.

Abstract
Three different perfluoroalkylated borafluorenes (FBf) were prepared and their electronic and photophysical properties were investigated. The systems have four trifluoromethyl moieties on the borafluorene moiety as well as two trifluoromethyl groups at the ortho positions of their exo&#8208;aryl moieties. They differ with regard to the para substituents on their exo&#8208;aryl moieties, being a proton (FXylFBf, FXyl: 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), a trifluoromethyl group (FMesFBf, FMes: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) or a dimethylamino group (p&#8208;NMe2&#8208;FXylFBf, p&#8208;NMe2&#8208;FXyl: 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), respectively. All derivatives exhibit extraordinarily low reduction potentials, comparable to those of perylenediimides. The most electron&#8208;deficient derivative FMesFBf was also chemically reduced and its radical anion isolated and characterized. Furthermore, all compounds exhibit very long fluorescent lifetimes of about 250&#8197;ns up to 1.6&#8197;&#956;s; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this differ. The donor&#8208;substituted derivative p&#8208;NMe2&#8208;FXylFBf exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state, whereas the FMesFBf and FXylFBf borafluorenes exhibit only weakly allowed locally excited (LE) transitions due to their symmetry and low transition&#8208;dipole moments.

      <title>Enhanced energy density of coaxial fiber asymmetric supercapacitor based on MoS2@Fe2O3/carbon nanotube paper and Ni(OH)2@NiCo2O4/carbon nanotube fiber electrodes</title>
      <dc:description>Fiber supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices for potential application in wearable and miniaturized portable electronics, which currently suffer the difficulty to achieve high capacitance and energy densities synchronously due to the limited specific surface area of electrode materials and material incompatibility between the two electrodes.

The as&#8208;prepared coaxial fiber asymmetric supercapacitors exhibited specific capacitance of 373 mF cm  &#8208;2  (at current densities of 2 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and energy density of 0.13 mW h cm  &#8208;2  (at the power density of 3.2 mW cm  &#8208;2  ), which also exhibited good rate capability, long cycle life and excellent flexibility.

      <title>Synthesis of Low&#8208;Valent Dinuclear Group 14 Compounds with Element&#8208;Element Bonds by Transylidation</title>
      <dc:description>Dinuclear low&#8208;valent compounds of the heavy main group elements are rare species owing to their intrinsic reactivity. However, they represent desirable target molecules due to their unusual bonding situations as well as applications in bond activations and materials synthesis. The isolation of such compounds usually requires the use of substituents that provide sufficient stability and synthetic access. Here we report on the use of strongly donating ylide&#8208;substituents to access low&#8208;valent dinuclear group 14 com&#173;pounds. The ylides not only impart steric and electronic stabilization, but also allow facile synthesis via transfer of an ylide from tetrylene precursors of type  R  Y  2  E to ECl2 (E = Ge, Sn; Y = TolSO  2  (PR  3  )C with R = Ph, Cy). This method allowed the isolation of dinuclear complexes amongst a germanium analogue of a vinyl cation, [(  Ph  Y)  2  GeGe(  Ph  Y)]+ with an electronic struc&#173;ture best described as a germylene&#8208;stabilized Ge(II) cation and a ylide(chloro)&#173;digermene [  Ph  Y(Cl)GeGe(Cl)  Ph  Y] with an unusually unsymmetrical structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Evaluation of Pd&#8594;B Interactions in Diphosphinoborane Complexes and Impact on Inner&#8208;Sphere Reductive Elimination</title>
      <dc:description>
Ligand effects: The borane acceptor in diphosphinoborane ligands discriminates between the oxidation state PdII and Pd0, stabilizing the latter. The impact of the Pd&#8594;B interaction on inner&#8208;sphere C&#8722;N bond reductive elimination of N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitroaniline was investigated (see scheme).







Abstract
The dative Pd&#8594;B interaction in a series of RDPBR&#8217; Pd0 and PdII complexes (RDPBR&#8217;=(o&#8208;PR2C6H4)2BR&#8217;, diphosphinoborane) was analyzed using XRD, 11B&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and NBO/NLMO calculations. The borane acceptor discriminates between the oxidation state PdII and Pd0, stabilizing the latter. Reaction of lithium amides with [(RDPBR&#8217;)PdII(4&#8208;NO2C6H4)I] chemoselectively yields the C&#8722;N coupling product. DFT modelling indicates no significant impact of PdII&#8594;B coordination on the inner&#8208;sphere reductive elimination rate.

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of the Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)aluminate</title>
      <dc:description>
The tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)aluminate rises from the once hidden class of perfluoroalkyl aluminum compounds and flourishes in all its beauty. Perfluorinated aryl, aryloxy and alkoxy aluminum species are well&#8208;established but the corresponding perfluoroalkyl aluminum derivatives are virtually unknown. A convenient synthesis of several [Al(C2F5)4]&#8722; salts was developed by the reaction of Li[AlH4] with Si(C2F5)3CH3 and a subsequent cation exchange. However, the [NBu4]+ and [PPh4]+ salts decompose at room temperature. Utilizing a weakly coordinating phosphazenium cation enhances the thermal stability, yielding [{(Et2N)3P=N}3P=N(H)tBu][Al(C2F5)4] as a stable solid. More information can be found in the Communication by B. Hoge et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000668).

      <dc:description>Construction of local donor&#8208;acceptor architecture is one of the valid means for facilitating the intramolecular charge transfer in organic semiconductors. To further accelerate the interface charge transfer, a ternary acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2) molecular junction is established via gradient nitrogen doping into the polymer skeleton. Accordingly, the exciton splitting and interface charge transfer could be promptly liberated because of the strong attracting ability of the two different electron acceptors. Both DFT calculations and photoluminescence spectra elucidate the swift charge transfer at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface. Consequently, the optimum polymer, N3&#8208;CP, undergoes a remarkable photocatalytic property in terms of hydrogen production with AQY405 nm = 26.6% by the rational design of asymmetric molecular junctions on organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

At 2:3 MeOH:H  2  O, crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) occurs via formation of an emissive crystal phase, whereas, at 1:9 MeOH:H  2  O, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) occurs, induced by emissive supramolecular nanoparticles (NPs). For  BNA&#8208;Ph  , the emission quantum yield was 25 times higher in aqueous methanol than that in pure methanol. Despite the high hydrophilicity of  BNA&#8208;X  (  C  log  P  = 6.1&#8722;8.0), the spherical NPs were monodisperse (polydispersity indices &lt; 0.2). Moreover, the emissive NPs exhibited fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with pyrene; however, for  BNA&#8208;X  bearing the TEMPO radical (  BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO  ), no FRET was observed because of quenching.

      <title>Selenium and Tellurium Derivatives of Corannulene:&#160;Serendipitous Finding of a One&#8208;Dimensional Stereoregular&#160;Coordination Polymer Crystal Based on Te&#8208;O Backbone and Side&#8208;Chain Aromatic Array</title>
      <dc:description>Monobromo&#8208;, tetrabromo&#8208;, and pentachloro&#8208;corannulene&#160;are subjected to nucleophilic substitution reactions with toluyl selenide and phenyl telluride&#8208;based nucleophiles generated in situ from the corresponding dichalcogenides. In the case of selenium nucleophile, the reaction provides moderate yields (52&#8208;77%) of the targeted corannulene selenoethers. A subsequent oxidation of the rim selenium atoms proceeds smoothly to furnish corannulene seleneoxides in 81&#8208;93% yield. In the case of tellurides, only monosubstitution of the corannulene scaffold could be achieved albeit with concomitant oxidation of the tellerium atom. Unexpectedly, this monotelluroxide derivative of corannulene (RR&#8217;Te=O, R = Ph, R&#8217; = corannulene) is observed to form a linear coordination polymer chain in the crystalline state. In this chain, Te&#8208;O constitutes the polymer backbone around which the aromatic groups (R and R&#8217;) arrange as polymer side&#8208;chains. The polymer crystal is stabilized through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions of the side&#8208;chains and intermolecular hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions with the solvent (chloroform) molecules.

      <title>Domain&#8208;level Single&#8208;Nucleotide Variants Diagnose Based on Eliminating Unexpected Secondary Structure</title>
      <dc:description>Identification of single&#8208;nucleotide variants (SNVs) is of great significance in molecular diagnosis. The problem that should not be ignored in the identification process is that the unexpected secondary structure of the target nucleic acid may greatly affect the detection accuracy. Herein, we proposed a conditional domain&#8208;level SNV diagnosis strategy, in which the subsequent SNV detection can only be carried out after eliminating the unexpected secondary structure of target DNA. Specifically, the target DNA is assembled into a rigid double strand, which makes folding the target DNA difficult and the unexpected secondary structure is eliminated.&#160; Based on this double&#8208;stranded structure, specially designed probes are used to detect double&#8208;stranded properties and&#160;report abundant domain&#8208;level oligonucleotide information to improve the effective information in the detection results and complete domain&#8208;level SNV diagnose. If the unexpected secondary structure is not eliminated, the detector will first detect it and feed back to us, ensuring the accuracy of the subsequent detection results. With the occurrence (or not) of SNV and the change of the SNV site, in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, we successfully identified the four homologous sequences to be tested related to BRAF gene.</dc:description>

      <title>Completely Amine&#8208;free Open Atmospheric Synthesis of High Quality Cesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr3) Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Cesium Lead Halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) &#160;have been prominent materials for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other significant applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronics. The oleylamine which play an important role for surface passivation may also be responsible for poor colloidal stability as a result of facile proton exchange leading to the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide which pulls out halide ion from NCs surface. In this work, we demonstrated a facile and efficient completely amine&#8208; free synthesis of cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals using hydrobromic acid as halide source and n&#8208;trioctylphosphine (TOP) as ligand in open atmospheric conditions. The hydrobromic acid (HBr) served as labile source of bromide ion thus this three&#8208;precursor (separate precursors for Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br) approach gives more control over conventional single source precursor for Pb and Br (PbBr  2  ). The use of HBr paved the way to eliminate oleylamine, thus we can completely exclude the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide. We extensively studied the various Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br molar ratio and found an optimum condition which able to make very stable with high PLQY CsPbBr  3  NCs. These completely amine free CsPbBr  3  perovskite NCs synthesized using bromine&#8208;rich condition exhibit good stability and durability for more than three months in the form of colloidal solutions and films respectively. More importantly, this work presents an open atmospheric stable CsPbBr  3  NCs films exhibiting high photoluminescence (PL) which can be further used for&#160;device applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermolecular C&#8211;H Activation at the Allylic/Benzylic and Homoallylic/Homobenzylic Positions of Cyclic Hydrocarbons by a Stable Divalent Silicon Species</title>
      <dc:description>Direct activation of inert C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds by main&#8208;group&#8208;element species is yet a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene through the allylic/benzylic and homoallylic/homobenzylic C&#8211;H bond activation by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene  1  in neat condition to yield the corresponding aromatic compounds. As for the reaction of cyclohexene, allylsilane  3  and 7&#8208;silanorbornene  4  were also observed, which could be interpreted as a direct dehydrogenative silylation reaction of monoalkenes at the allylic positions. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene at the homoallylic position was accomplished by a combination of silylene  1  and radical intermediates such as hydrosilyl radical  INT1  or cyclohexenyl radical  H  which are generated in the initial step of the reaction.</dc:description>
