         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Functionalized Cyanopyridines Yield an Extremely Low&#8208;Reduction&#8208;Potential Anolyte for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanopyridines and cyanophenylpyridines were investigated as anolytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2 V or lower vs ferrocene  +/0  , but the 3&#8208;CNPy  &#8226;&#8208;  radical anion forms a sigma&#8208;dimer that is re&#8208;oxidized at  E  &#8776; &#8722;1.1 V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge&#8208;discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50 M [NBu  4  ][PF  6  ] shows that 2&#8208;CNPy and 4&#8208;CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that adding a phenyl group to the cyanopyridines would, for some isomers, limit dimerization and improve the stability of the radical anions, while shifting their  E  1/2  only about +0.10 V relative to the parent cyanopyridines. Among the cyanophenylpyridines, 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy and 3&#8208;CN&#8208;4&#8208;PhPy are the most promising as anolytes. They exhibit reversible reductions at  E  1/2  = &#8722;2.19 and &#8722;2.22 V vs ferrocene  +/0  (Fc  +/0  ), respectively, and retain about half of their capacity after 30 bulk charge&#8208;discharge cycles. An improved version of 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy with three methyl groups (3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)pyridine) has an extremely low reduction potential of &#8211;2.50 V vs Fc  +/0  (the lowest reported for a nonaqueous RFB anolyte) and loses only 0.21% of capacity per cycle during charge&#8208;discharge cycling in acetonitrile.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g&#8208;C  3  N  4  (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, we found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO  2  rods and nanoparticles (B  N  &#8208;B  R  ) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in B  N  &#8208;B  R  /CN composites. The B  N  &#8208;B  R  /CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H  2  evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm) compared with the single component. A continuous electron transfer channel constructed by an interfacial chemical bond Ti&#8208;O&#8208;N between CN and brookite rods (B  R  ) and B  N  &#8208;B  R  homophase junction between brookite nanoparticles and rods was proposed to benefit the charge extraction and transfer. Our work provides a strategy to tune the charge separation and transfer to facilitate the photocatalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights of Selective Intramolecular O&#8208;atom Transfer Mediated by Bioinspired Copper Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational insights on reactivity: The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;H bond hydroxylation is investigated using DFT calculations. The computed mechanism involves a dinuclear side&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxo dicopper(II) adduct in equilibrium with the key oxidizing intermediate bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper(III) species. The difference of reactivity towards internal substrates bearing activated or non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is rationalized.







Abstract
The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8722;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8722;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (L1) or non&#8208;activated (L2) C&#8722;H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a side&#8208;on peroxide species (P) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;oxo) isomer (O) responsible for the C&#8722;H activation step. The P/O equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes. However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C&#8722;H activation step, where the complex bearing the non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Inert Arenes using a Photochemically Activated Guanidinato&#8208;Magnesium(I) Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical approach. Activations of arene C&#8722;H bonds by a photochemically excited dimagnesium(I) compound are reported (see picture, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Experimental and theoretical evidence for the intermediacy of magnesium radicals in these reactions is presented. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H bond activations hold considerable potential for organic synthesis.







Abstract
UV irradiation of solutions of a guanidinate coordinated dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(Priso)Mg}2] 3 (Priso=[(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in either benzene, toluene, the three isomers of xylene, or mesitylene, leads to facile activation of an aromatic C&#8722;H bond of the solvent in all cases, and formation of aryl/hydride bridged magnesium(II) products, [{(Priso)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;Ar)] 4&#8211;9. In contrast to similar reactions reported for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate coordinated counterparts of 3, these C&#8722;H activations proceed with little regioselectivity, though they are considerably faster. Reaction of 3 with an excess of the pyridine, p&#8208;NC5H4But (pyBut), gave [(Priso)Mg(pyButH)(pyBut)2] 10, presumably via reduction of the pyridine to yield a radical intermediate, [(Priso)Mg(pyBut&#8901;)(pyBut)2] 11, which then abstracts a proton from the reaction solvent or a reactant. DFT calculations suggest two possible pathways to the observed arene C&#8722;H activations. One of these involves photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Mg bond of 3, generating magnesium(I) doublet radicals, (Priso)Mg&#8901;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange via C&#8722;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species includes the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of 3 leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H activation process and formation of an alkyl&#8208;bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(&#956;&#8208;Priso&#8722;H)}2] 12. Furthermore, irradiation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 3 and the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] (DipNacnac=[HC(MeCNDip)2]&#8722;), effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the near quantitative formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8722;Mg(DipNacnac)] 13. Finally, the EPR spectrum (77&#8197;K) of a glassed solution of UV irradiated 3 is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a doublet radical species.

One of these involves photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Mg bond of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, generating magnesium(I) doublet radicals, (Priso)Mg&#8901;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch-like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange via C&#8722;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species includes the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H activation process and formation of an alkyl-bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(&#956;-Priso&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;H&lt;/sup&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;. Furthermore, irradiation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and the &#946;-diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(&lt;sup&gt;Dip&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;sup&gt;Dip&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac=[HC(MeCNDip)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the near quantitative formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8722;Mg(&lt;sup&gt;Dip&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)] &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;. Finally, the EPR spectrum (77&#8197;K) of a glassed solution of UV irradiated &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a doublet radical species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borate Buffer as a Key Player in Cu&#8208;Based Homogeneous Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO33&#8722; anion from borate buffer provides a structural bridge between low&#8208;cost Cu complexes to form a new in situ trinuclear complex as a fast electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation; likewise, the borate species from the buffer solution at pH&#8197;9 facilitate the high turnover frequency (TOF) by playing a significant role in the O&#8208;O bond formation step.







Abstract
Borate buffer was found to have both structural and functional roles within a low&#8208;cost tri&#8208;copper electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation that exhibits a high turnover frequency of 310&#8197;s&#8722;1. The borate buffer was shown to facilitate the catalytic activity by both bridging the three Cu ions and participating in O&#8722;O bond formation. Phosphate and acetate buffers did not show such roles, making borate a unique player in this catalytic system.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From traditional to sustainable: Catalysts with platinum&#8208;group metals are well&#8208;established in the field of hydroboration of C&#8722;C multiple bonds. However, the current mantra in catalysis is to employ &#8220;cheap metals for noble tasks&#8221;. In this regard, we have developed a bis(phosphino)carbazolido magnesium&#8208;methyl complex as a catalyst for the hydroboration of alkenes, alkynes, and biologically essential terpenes by using pinacolborane (HBpin) as a hydride donor. More information can be found in the Research Article by R.&#8197;G. Gonnade, D. Koley, S.&#8197;S. Sen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201896).

Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates was disclosed. The addition of electrogenerated boryl or silyl radicals onto many &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a large panel of synthetically useful gem&#8208;difluoro and &#947;&#8208;fluoroallyl boronates and silanes (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). In addition, a scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased using an electrochemical reactor with promising volumetric productivity (688&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1 and 496&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1). Moreover, the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations. Finally, plausible reaction mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of the products.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways to detect some of these sites with the help of double&#8208;resonance techniques. These sequences ported the signatures of dilute, low&#8208;g nuclei onto the abundant water 1H signal through the spontaneous exchanges that labile OH and NH protons undergo with H2O. These effects provide new routes in molecular NMR imaging.







Abstract
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways of detecting some of these sites with the help of proton&#8208;detected double resonance techniques. As standard coherence transfer methods are of limited use for such indirect detection, alternative routes for probing the quadrupolar spectra on 1H were tested. These centered on modulating the broadening effects imparted onto protons adjacent to the low&#8208;&#947; species through J couplings through either continuous wave or spin&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance decoupling/recoupling sequences. As in all cases, the changes imparted by these double&#8208;resonance strategies were small due to the fast relaxation undergone by the quadrupoles, the sensitivity of these approaches was amplified by transferring their effects onto the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications were mediated by the spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons. In experiments designed on the basis of double&#8208;resonance spin echoes, these enhancements were imparted by looping the transverse encodings together with multiple longitudinal storage periods, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with exchange (D&#8208;REX) sequences. In experiments designed on the basis of continuous on/off quadrupolar decoupling, these solvent exchanges were incorporated into chemical&#8208;exchange saturation transfer schemes, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with saturation transfer (D&#8208;REST) sequences. Both of these variants harnessed sizable proportions of the easily detectable water signals, in order to characterize the NMR spectra and/or to image with atomic&#8208;site specificity the 17O and 14N species.

These effects provide new routes in molecular NMR imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways of detecting some of these sites with the help of proton-detected double resonance techniques. As standard coherence transfer methods are of limited use for such indirect detection, alternative routes for probing the quadrupolar spectra on &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H were tested. These centered on modulating the broadening effects imparted onto protons adjacent to the low-&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt; species through &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt; couplings through either continuous wave or spin-echo double-resonance decoupling/recoupling sequences. As in all cases, the changes imparted by these double-resonance strategies were small due to the fast relaxation undergone by the quadrupoles, the sensitivity of these approaches was amplified by transferring their effects onto the abundant water &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H signal. These amplifications were mediated by the spontaneous exchanges that the labile &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hs bound to &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O or &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N undergo with the water protons. In experiments designed on the basis of double-resonance spin echoes, these enhancements were imparted by looping the transverse encodings together with multiple longitudinal storage periods, leading to decoupling-recoupling with exchange (D-REX) sequences. In experiments designed on the basis of continuous on/off quadrupolar decoupling, these solvent exchanges were incorporated into chemical-exchange saturation transfer schemes, leading to decoupling-recoupling with saturation transfer (D-REST) sequences. Both of these variants harnessed sizable proportions of the easily detectable water signals, in order to characterize the NMR spectra and/or to image with atomic-site specificity the &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries (PALBs) are widely attracting researchers because they can directly convert solar energy into electric energy for storage or output without any intermediate. Highly active photogenerated carriers can enhance the battery reaction and reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process to increase the energy efficiency. The development of various PALBs is discussed under the aspects of configuration, mechanism, electrodes design and performance.







Abstract
The application of solar energy is crucial for alleviating the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development. In recent years, photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable batteries have attracted researchers because they can directly convert and store solar energy in the batteries. And it also can be used like a normal battery without light illumination. Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries have received more attention than other energy storage systems due to their higher energy density and relatively mature development. This Review focuses on the design of various photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries including Li&#8208;ion, Li&#8208;S, Li&#8208;O2, Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;I batteries, as well as the working mechanism of photoelectrodes in these battery systems. The basic understanding and challenge of photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. At last, perspectives for the photoelectrode development are provided in the summary to advance photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobate Nanosheet Assembly with Au NPs and CdS QDs as a Highly Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excellent 2D photocatalyst was synthesized by loading Au nanoparticles and CdS quantum dots on niobate nanosheets. This CdS/Au/HNb3O8 photocatalyst not only increased the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate by 254 times compared with the pure niobate nanosheet, but also showed outstanding photocatalytic performance for oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine and degradation of organic dyes.







Abstract
Niobate nanosheets have aroused widespread interest in recent years for their prospects in catalysis. The exploration of 2D niobate catalysis with stable and efficient properties is still the focus in chemistry and materials science. Herein, the successful fabrication of 2D CdS/Au/HNb3O8 catalyst is demonstrated which revealed efficient photocatalytic properties in H2 evolution, oxidative self&#8208;coupling of amines to imines, and degradation of dyes. Especially the assembled architecture can give a rate of 5.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 of photocatalytic H2 evolution, an &#8764;254&#8208;fold enhancement, compared with bare HNb3O8 nanosheets under identical conditions. In accordance with density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, the vast improvements are benefited from efficient migration and separation of charge carriers. Besides, the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs enhances the light harvesting capacity and boosts the generation of hot electrons, efficiently improving the visible&#8208;light absorption.

         <title>Two Novel Three&#8208;Dimensional Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Rare Earth MOFs with Ultra&#8208;High Proton Conductivity and Performance Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained with the same topology by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity: the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability.







Abstract
In this work, the two example rare earth&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LaIII&#8208;based MOFs), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, with the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB being 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C and that of Gd&#8208;ETTB being 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than for most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiments and continuous work tests showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiments showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed the hydrogen&#8208;bond network's being rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and thus optimizing the channels for proton transfer explained the MOF's high performance.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Mono&#8208; vs. Di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of mono&#8208; and double&#8208;arylated products at ortho position was feasible via the pyrazolone directing group. The selectivity of the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction was controlled by the temperature and derived from the structure of the used directing group. This allowed the achievement of unsymmetrical double&#8208;substituted arylated products in a one&#8208;pot procedure. Ortho&#8208;arylated pyrazolones underwent unusual decarboxylative cleavage under relatively mild conditions to form hydrazones.







Abstract
A method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation assisted with a 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylpyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;on directing group, selectively providing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylated products is reported. Steric hindrance appearing between the directing group and the already introduced aryl substituent enables control of mono&#8208; vs. diarylation selectivity by the temperature of the reaction. Taking advantage of this, a series of monosubstituted and disubstituted derivatives were obtained in good yields. Moreover, unsymmetrical double&#8208;arylation in a one&#8208;pot procedure was developed to give corresponding products in reasonable yields. Additionally, synthesis and X&#8208;ray study of intermediate palladium metallacycles of both, the first and second arylation reactions, were conducted. X&#8208;ray structure comparison emphasizes the geometrical differences that were consistent with the observed reactivity. Finally, decarboxylative cleavage of the pyrazolone directing group under mild conditions gave synthetically useful hydrazones. The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such ortho arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.

The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging Metal and Ligand Reactive Sites for One Pot Reactions: Ligand&#8208;Centered Borenium Ions for Tandem Catalysis with Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;containing diphosphorous ligands are reported that are capable of tandem cycloaddition and cross&#8208;coupling catalysis using separate reactive sites on the metal and ligand.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts that perform two different organic transformations in a single pot are highly desirable because they enable rapid and efficient assembly of simple organic building blocks into more complex molecules. Many examples of tandem catalysis rely on metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving one or more metal complexes. Remarkably, despite surging interest in the development of chemically reactive (i.&#8201;e., non&#8208;innocent) ligands, there are few examples of metal complexes that leverage ligand&#8208;centered reactivity to perform catalytic reactions in tandem with separate catalytic reactions at the metal. Here we report how multifunctional Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;derived diphosphorus ligands, called TBDPhos, appear to facilitate borenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reactions at the ligand, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions at the metal. Both transformations can be accessed in one pot to afford rare examples of tandem catalysis using separate metal and ligand catalysis sites in a single complex.

         <title>Insights into the Effect of the Adsorption Preference of Additives on the Anisotropic Growth of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encouraging growth &#8211; more or less: The adsorption preference of eight additives and their role in the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Either an inhibition or a promotion effect is revealed by these additives. A descriptor related to the adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was employed to estimate the ZSM&#8208;5 morphology, which varied from sphere&#8208;like to plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like.







Abstract
Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role in affecting catalytic performance, while is persistently challenging to tailor through crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced into the synthesis of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, however their role and the underlying mechanism are not well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either an inhibition effect or a promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites varying from sphere&#8208;like, plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.

Enjoying the sun: The cover illustrates the potential of heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes to facilitate the P arylation of H&#8208;phosphonates with diazonium salts, while visible light kicks off the dual gold and photoredox catalytic cycle. The underlying structure of the catalysts&#8217; coordinating ligand system is accessible by a novel postfunctionalization approach, and the stereochemistry can be controlled by the order of metal coordination and click reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Breher and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201856).

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BPh3 and PhSiH3, represented as the stars Hikoboshi and Orihime, constitute a powerful catalytic system for deoxygenative CO2 conversions. According to a Japanese legend, this couple were banished to opposite sides of the Milky Way only coming together once a year. When BPh3 and PhSiH3 come together as catalyst and reductant, N&#8208;methylaniline undergoes N&#8208;methylation at room temperature under CO2 and under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The catalytic mechanism was studied by NMR measurements and DFT calculations, both of which strongly suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722; as a key catalytic species. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;y. Hasegawa, T. Ema, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202210).

         <title>A Stereodivergent Approach to the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel designed stereodivergent strategy for the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropnes. The reaction provides a highly modular approach to prepare cyclopropane ring variants bearing gem(Bpin,Bpin), gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bdan), and gem&#8208;(Bpin,BF3K), with outstanding levels of stereocontrol. This was achieved by diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes with &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;trifluoromethyl. The key to the success of this general protocol was the diastereoselective trifluorination reaction of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes, followed by the stereospecific interconversion of the trifluoroborate salts into the Bdan group.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Glycans to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein, an Open Question: NMR Data on Binding Site Localization, Affinity, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have used NMR experiments to explore binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV&#8209;2 spike glycoprotein (S&#8209;protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm binding of sialoglycans to the S&#8209;protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the mM range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S&#8209;protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S&#8208;protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916; 143&#8208;145 of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein, supporting localization of the binding site in the N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8209;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8209;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using  1  H,  15  N TROSY HSQC based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments we exclude binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8209;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan&#8208;binding to the S&#8208;protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating bacteria extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple ketones has been achieved by chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage of &#946;&#8208;diketones.

Furthermore, oxidative catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation has also been realized with free p&#8208;aminophenols.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Reversible Solvent Uptake in&#160;Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic behaviour of Supramolecular Organic Frameworks (SOFs) based on the rigid tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane ( TPPM) organic tecton has been elucidated through 3D Electron Diffraction, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The SOF undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to vapors of selected organic solvents, moving from a closed structure with isolated small voids to an expanded structure with solvated channel along the b axis. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOF, following the degree of packing coefficient. The effect of solvent uptake on TPPM solid&#8208;state fluorescence was investigated, evidencing a significant variation in the emission profile only in the presence of chloroform.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Stereogenic Primary Aminophosphine Sulfides under Reductive Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereochemically pure phosphines with phosphorus&#8211;heteroatom bonds and  P&#8208;centered chirality are a promising class of functional building blocks for the design of chiral ligands and organocatalysts. A route to enantiomerically pure primary aminophosphine sulfides was opened through stereospecific reductive C&#8211;N bond cleavage of phosphorus(V) precursors by lithium in liquid ammonia. The chemoselectivity of the reaction as a function of reaction time, substrate pattern, and chiral auxiliary was investigated. In the presence of exclusively aliphatic groups bound to the phosphorus atom, all competing reductive side reactions are totally prevented. The absolute configurations of all  P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their use as synthetic building blocks was demonstrated. The lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;dithiophosphoric acid proved to be a useful stereochemical probe to determine the enantiomeric purity. Insights into the coordination mode of the lithium&#8208;based chiral complex formed in solution was provided by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Organocatalysts &#8211; Singly&#8208;linked and Macrocyclic Bisphosphoric Acids for Asymmetric Phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The linking of phosphoric acids via covalent or mechanical bonds has proven to be a successful strategy for the design of novel organocatalysts. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, including their synthesis and their application in phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We found that the novel bisphosphoric acids show dramatically increased enantioselectivities in comparison to their &#160;monophosphoric acid analogues. However, the nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence on the enantioselectivities. In the asymmetric dearomative fluorination via phase&#8208;transfer catalysis, bisphosphoric acids with a single, rigid bisalkyne&#8208;linker give the best results with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. In contrast, bisphosphoric acids with flexible linkers give excellent enantioselectivities in the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation of quinolines via cooperative Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT&#8208;calculations.</dc:description>

In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT-calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Nodes of Metal Organic Frameworks can Activate Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation of multiple bonds are among the most general and important organic reactions. Typical heterogeneous catalysts are based on transition metal nanoparticles, including noble metals. Data are presented here showing that metal nodes of MIL&#8208;101 and UiO&#8208;66 in the absence of occluded metal nanoparticles can promote hydrogenation of polarized X=Y double bonds of nitro groups and carbonyl. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemotactic Colloidal Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemotactic colloidal motors can be served as excellent physical models of non&#8208;equilibrium complex systems and also have potential in active target delivery and other biomedical applications. In this Concept, both the recent experimental progress and theoretical opinion of chemotactic motors based on the torque&#8208;driven self&#8208;reorientation and alignment mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in the realization of various functions of human life such as fertilization, immune function, inflammatory response, regeneration processes, etc. Inspired by the natural chemotaxis, colloidal motors with chemotactic ability can realize intelligent sense and targeted navigation, which bring a revolutionary method to biomedical applications like precision medicine. However, the application in the biomedical field requires the colloidal motors with submicrometer scale, strong chemotactic ability and clear chemotactic mechanism. In this Concept article, we introduce the recent progress of chemotactic colloidal motors, covering the fundamental theory behind experimental advancements. Particularly, the torque&#8208;driven reorientation motion of the submicrometer&#8208;sized colloidal motors during chemotaxis is discussed, and also their underlying mechanism is proposed. With the continuous research on chemotactic colloidal motors, it is believed that the emerging chemotactic colloidal motors will broaden practical applications in the biomedical field.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What shape are you in? The structure of amorphous TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O has been determined from DFT calculations and EXAFS measurements. Contrary to the generally accepted model, TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O forms zigzag chains of cis&#8208;Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)4(H2O)2 units. A slow aging process results in increasing polymerization that might eventually lead to a new TcO2 polymorph. Formation of these phases with low solubility is highly relevant for the confinement of long&#8208;lived 99Tc in deep nuclear waste repositories.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;emitting 99Tc isotope is a high&#8208;yield fission product in 235U and 239Pu nuclear reactors, raising special concern in nuclear waste management due to its long half&#8208;life and the high mobility of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;). Under the conditions of deep nuclear waste repositories, Tc is retained through biotic and abiotic reduction of TcO4&#8722; to compounds like amorphous TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O precipitates. It is generally accepted that these precipitates have linear (Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)2(H2O)2)n chains, with trans H2O. Although corresponding Tc&#8722;Tc and Tc&#8722;O distances have been obtained from extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, this structure is largely based on analogy with other compounds. Here, we combine density&#8208;functional theory with EXAFS measurements of fresh and aged samples to show that, instead, TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O forms zigzag chains that undergo a slow aging process whereby they combine to form longer chains and, later, a tridimensional structure that might lead to a new TcO2 polymorph.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) is of great significance. A variety of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nanoprobes for ROS and RNS detection is reviewed. Our focus is to describe how they are built and how do they work. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges for UCNPs&#8208;based NIR nanoprobes are briefly discussed, and how to improve the performance of UCNPs is also prospected.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are essential oxidative metabolites of organisms, which are closely related to physiological, pathological and pharmacological processes. The accurate detection of ROS/RNS is important for the understanding of biological processes, monitoring of pharmacological effects, and predicting the course of disease. The recently developed NIR nanoprobes based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) hold great prospects in sensitive and deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS/RNS, and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In this review, we systematically summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances of UCNPs&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probes for ROS/RNS sensing, and the potential challenges and perspectives for further research are also highlighted. We envision that such a research field will have a bright future for modern biomedical applications.

         <title>YfeX &#8211; A New Platform for Carbene Transferase Development with High Intrinsic Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases. WT YfeX catalyzes N&#8722;H insertion (including aliphatic and secondary amines) in high yield, cyclopropanation, and most excitingly, Si&#8722;H insertion of dimethylphenylsilane. QM/MM calculations reveal details of the mechanism of the unusual Si&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
Carbene transfer biocatalysis has evolved from basic science to an area with vast potential for the development of new industrial processes. In this study, we show that YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases, due to its high intrinsic reactivity, especially for the N&#8722;H insertion reaction of aromatic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. YfeX shows high stability against organic solvents (methanol and DMSO), greatly improving turnover of hydrophobic substrates. Interestingly, in styrene cyclopropanation, WT YfeX naturally shows high enantioselectivity, generating the trans product with 87&#8201;% selectivity for the (R,R) enantiomer. WT YfeX also catalyzes the Si&#8722;H insertion efficiently. Steric effects in the active site were further explored using the R232A variant. Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) calculations reveal details on the mechanism of Si&#8722;H insertion. YfeX, and potentially other peroxidases, are exciting new targets for the development of improved carbene transferases.

         <title>Self&#8208;repairable and flexible polymer network electrolyte with enhanced lithium ion conduction for lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance functional polymer&#8208;based electrolytes is important for realizing next generation safe lithium metal batteries. In this study, a new type of quasi&#8208;solid polymer network electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) was prepared by combining synthesized polymer network (SIPH) containing urethane bond linked ionic liquids (ILs), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and disulfide bond moieties, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), and glyme type additive. It was found that SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% was mechanically flexible, self&#8208;healable, and showed high ionic conductivity of 2.67&#215;10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  . Also, SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% owned high lithium ion transference number of 0.43 and good electrochemical stability. These properties enabled the SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% electrolyte membrane to support Li/Li symmetrical cell to cycle stably during long term Li plating and stripping. The Li/SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40%/LFP showed high delivered specific capacity and good stability (166.1 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 106 cycles at 0.2 C). Such glyme doped polymer network electrolyte provides new experimental findings for developing polymer&#8208;based electrolyte with excellent mechanical integrity and battery related properties.</dc:description>

         <title>From Nanoparticle Ensembles to Single Nanoparticles: Techniques for the Investigation of Plasmon Enhanced Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 53, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress of plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) in terms of three types of electrochemical methods (macroscopic PEEC measurements, PEEC based on scanning electrochemical microscope, and PEEC based on nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry) is discussed in this Concept article.







Abstract
Plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC), where specific electrochemical reactions are promoted due to the reduced energy barrier of the reaction processes by the light excited &#8220;hot carriers&#8221; of the plasmonic nanoparticles, has aroused tremendous interest in recent years. A deep understanding of the PEEC process becomes a key issue for facilitating PEEC catalyst design and improving PEEC performance. This concept article begins with a brief discussion of the macroscopic electrochemical method of PEEC study of the plasmonic nanoparticle ensembles. Following that, we highlight two electrochemical techniques that may possess single nanoparticle sensitivity, i.&#8201;e., scanning electrochemical microscope and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. The pros and cons of each technique are discussed and an outlook is given. We hope to provide the readers with the current status of PEEC to evoke reflections regarding the reaction mechanisms, performance improvement, and the utilizations to important systems.

         <title>Heterolytic O&#8722;O Bond Cleavage Upon Single Electron Transfer to a Nonheme Fe(III)&#8722;OOH Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 53, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron reduction of a nonheme FeIII(OOH) intermediate results in the release of the FeII(OH) complex and O2, following a bimolecular reaction consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo ligand in a putative FeII(OOH) species. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of the nonheme iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, [FeIII(OOH)(L52)]2+ (L52=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), carried out at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C results in the release of dioxygen and in the formation of [FeII(OH)(L52)]+ following a bimolecular process. This reaction can be performed either with cobaltocene as chemical reductant, or electrochemically. These experimental observations are consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo group in the putative FeII(OOH) intermediate generated upon reduction of the FeIII(OOH) starting complex. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.

         <title>Direct Comparison of Subvalent, Polycationic Group 13 Cluster Compounds: Lessons learned on Isoelectronic DMPE Substituted Gallium and Indium Tetracation Salts</title>

Four members only. Two novel tetracationic, subvalent clusters [{M(dmpe)}4][Al(ORF)4]4 (M=Ga and In; dmpe=bisdimethylphosphinoethane; RF=C(CF3)3) are presented. In both clusters, the metal ions form a tetragon, with every M atom being four&#8208;coordinated by two M atoms and two donor P atoms. The respective bonding situation and dissociation behavior in solution were thoroughly investigated.







Abstract
The tetracationic, univalent cluster compounds [{M(dmpe)}4]4+ (M=Ga, In; dmpe=bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) were synthesized as their pf salts ([pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The four&#8208;membered ring in [{M(dmpe)}4]4+ is slightly puckered for M=Ga and almost square planar for M=In. Yet, although structurally similar, only the gallium cluster is prevalent in solution, while the indium cluster forms temperature dependent equilibria that include even the monomeric cation [In(dmpe)]+. This system is the first report of one and the same ligand inducing formation of isoelectronic and isostructural gallium/indium cluster cations. The system allows to study systematically analogies and differences with thermodynamic considerations and bonding analyses, but also to outline perspectives for bond activation using cationic, subvalent group 13 clusters.

         <title>Reversible Photoinduced Conversion of Unprecedented Norbornadiene&#8208;Based Photoswitches with Redox&#8208;Active Naphthalene Diimide Functionalities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 53, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new photoswitches based on functional NBD&#8208;NDI&#8208;hybrid structures were synthesized and were reversibly switched between their two isomeric states. The photo&#8208;induced conversion, enabled by the redox&#8208;active NDI building block, was investigated in dependency of spacer length and concentration. The experimental results and proposed mechanistic pathway were supported by the conducted DFT calculations.







Abstract
An unprecedented compound class of functional organic hybrids consisting of a photoswitchable norbornadiene building block and a redoxactive chromophore, namely naphthalene diimide, were designed and synthesized. Within these structures the capability of rylene chromophores to function as a redox active catalyst upon their photoexcitation was utilized to initiate the oxidative back&#8208;conversion of the in&#8197;situ formed quadricyclane unit to its norbornadiene analogue. In this way successive photoexcitation at two different wavelengths enabled a controlled photoswitching between the two isomerical states of the hybrids. Beyond this prove of concept, the dependency of the reaction rate to the intramolecular distance of the two functional molecular building blocks as well as the concentration of the photoexcited sample was monitored. The experimental findings and interpretations were furthermore supported by quantum chemical investigations.

         <title>Homolytic N&#8722;S Bond Cleavage in Vinyl Triflimides Enabled by Triplet&#8211;Triplet Energy Transfer</title>

No need to pay for extras: Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. Computational analysis identified homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;Tf bond induced by triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) as an accessible reaction manifold. This hypothesis was verified, and vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF3 reagents.







Abstract
Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. A computational analysis identified homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;Tf bond induced by triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) as a highly interesting reaction type that might be accessible. A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals to be amenable to radical&#8211;radical coupling. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF3 reagents.

         <title>Intense Molar Circular Dichroism in Fully Conjugated All&#8208;Carbon Macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne Linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes

Enantiopure trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes were synthesized by a homocoupling reaction in high yields and their photophysical properties were analyzed. Investigating the chiroptical properties revealed unrivalled molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and efficient through&#8208;space conjugation to reach astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation lengths.







Abstract
The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized that pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure, literature&#8208;known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;meta PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, it is shown that the pseudo&#8208;meta PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches a polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, it is shown that the chiral pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs induce a remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Reactions of Diethylazo&#8208;Dicarboxylate with Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>

         <dc:description>
Reactions of phosphines and B(C6F5)3 or BPh3 with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afforded products with either P&#8722;N/B&#8722;O lor P&#8722;N/B&#8722;N linkages. In all cases, the isomers obtained were computed to be both higher in energy and were readily distinguishable by 31P and 11B&#8197;NMR parameters. Steric demands and electronics are shown to impact the nature of these FLP addition products.







Abstract
Reactions of PAr3/B(C6F5)3 (Ar=o&#8208;Tol, Mes, Ph) FLPs with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afford the corresponding FLP addition products 1&#8211;3 in which P&#8722;N and B&#8722;O linkages are formed. In contrast, the reaction of BPh3, PPh3 and DEAD gave product 4 where P&#8722;N and N&#8722;B linkages were confirmed. In all cases, other binding modes were computed to be both higher in energy and readily distinguishable by 31P and 11B&#8197;NMR parameters.

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 53, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 2&#8208;aminophenyl pyridines with a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond displays excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, as witnessed by their double emission profile. Their protonation or deprotonation modulates their emission properties, thereby making them promising for pH sensing applications.







Abstract
The dynamic nature of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and its effect on emission spectra is an attractive strategy to create multi&#8208;emissive dyes. Here we describe the behavior of a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded triphenylpyridines with a set of donor&#8211;acceptor combinations that allowed us to perceive the influence of each substitution on the photophysical properties of the dyes. The susceptibility of these ESIPT moieties to pH variations was also studied, elucidating that the level of protonation had a significant effect on the emission color. The assignment of each emission band was made by using DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations that were in agreement with the experimental results. This study emphasizes the versatility of triphenylpyridines that can be synthesized effortlessly with a logical and independent C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 substitution in order to have the desired ESIPT modulation and subsequent multi&#8208;emission response.

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Dinuclear Mn(I) Catalysts in E&#8208;Selective Alkyne Semihydrogenation: A Mechanistic Investigation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 53, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable dinuclear Mn hydrides (single&#8208;step &amp; gram&#8208;scale from commercially available materials) have utility in alkyne semihydrogenation where the trans&#8208;alkene is the kinetic product. This selectivity mechanism contrasts typical tandem hydrogenation then isomerization systems.







Abstract
Dinuclear manganese hydride complexes of the form [Mn2(CO)8(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;PR2)] (R=Ph, 1; R=iPr, 2) were used in E&#8208;selective alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation (E&#8208;SASH) catalysis. Catalyst speciation studies revealed rich coordination chemistry and the complexes thus formed were isolated and in turn tested as catalysts; the results underscore the importance of dinuclearity in engendering the observed E&#8208;selectivity and provide insights into the nature of the active catalyst. The insertion product obtained from treating 2 with (cyclopropylethynyl)benzene contains a cis&#8208;alkenyl bridging ligand with the cyclopropyl ring being intact. Treatment of this complex with H2 affords exclusively trans&#8208;(2&#8208;cyclopropylvinyl)benzene. These results, in addition to other control experiments, indicate a non&#8208;radical mechanism for E&#8208;SASH, which is highly unusual for Mn&#8722;H catalysts. The catalytically active species are virtually inactive towards cis to trans alkene isomerization indicating that the E&#8208;selective process is intrinsic and dinuclear complexes play a critical role. A reaction mechanism is proposed accounting for the observed reactivity which is fully consistent with a kinetic analysis of the rate limiting step and is further supported by DFT computations.

This work disclosed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctional butanes, providing a general route to important industrial intermediates to nylon&#8197;6,6. This protocol is highly efficient for various activated alkenes at ambient temperature utilizing hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with assistant of catalytic amount of base as the proton shuttle.







Abstract
The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon&#8197;6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized butane derivatives.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Loading and High&#8208;Performing Ionic Liquid&#8208;Immobilizing Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Hydroformylation</title>

A keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic liquid immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity for styrene hydroformylation; both the conversion and the yield of aldehyde can reach almost 99&#8201;%, and a TOF was obtained as high as 9000&#8197;h&#8722;1 without using any phosphine ligand in the reaction process.







Abstract
We have developed a Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic&#8208;liquid (IL)&#8208;immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst (MTOA)5[SiW11O39Rh] (MOTA=methyltrioctylammonium cation) that can afford exceptionally high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes at an ultralow loading of Rh (ca. 3&#8197;ppm). For styrene hydroformylation, both the conversion and the yield of the aldehyde can reach almost 99&#8201;%, and a TOF as high as 9000&#8197;h&#8722;1 was obtained without using any phosphine ligand in the reaction process. Further characterization by FTIR, ICP and ESI&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the single Rh atom was incorporated in the lacunary POM anions. In particular, the bulky IL cation can play an additional role in stabilizing Rh species and thus prevent aggregation and leaching of Rh species. The IL catalyst was miscible with n&#8208;hexane at temperatures; this contributed to exceptionally high activity for hydroformylation even at ultra&#8208;low loading of IL catalyst.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into the Photoinduced Damage of an Unnatural Base Pair</title>

Four photodamage products of dTPT3 have been isolated and identified, which has provided insight into the photodamage mechanism with a Type II photosensitized oxidation. The antioxidant ascorbate was discovered to effectively inhibit the formation of these photodamage products with no new byproducts generated, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects.







Abstract
Chemical&#8208; and photostability of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) are important to maintain the genetic code integrity, and critical for developing healthy semisynthetic organisms. As reported, dTPT3 was less stable upon irradiation, and thus might act as a pervasive photosensitizer to induce oxidative damage within DNA, causing harm to living semi&#8208;synthetic organisms when exposed to UVA radiation. However, there was no knowledge about molecular&#8208;level understanding of this damage process. In this paper, we not only identified four photoproducts of dTPT3, including desulfur&#8208;dTPT3 (dTPT3H), TPT3 sulphinate (TPT3SO2), TPT3 sulphonate (TPT3SO3) and TPT3&#8208;thioTPT3 (TPT3STPT3), but also established a Type II photosensitized oxidation mechanism. In addition, the antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) was able to effectively inhibit the photoproducts formation of dTPT3 and dTPT3 in DNA, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA bearing dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects. The comprehensive understanding of TPT3&#8217; photochemical stability will give researchers helpful guidance to design more photostable UBPs and construct healthier semisynthetic organisms.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Decoration of a Tetraazaperylene with Urea Units: Chiral Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) and Their Optical and Chiroptical Properties</title>

Decorating tetraazaperylene. A new class of highly fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) is described along with their electrochemical, photophysical and chiroptical properties. They contain a tetraazaperylene core with a urea&#8208;derived periphery that is complementary to the dicarboximido termini in perylene tetracarboxydiimides.







Abstract
Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core that is formally condensed with N&#8208;substituted urea units in the two opposite peri positions. Here, we report the synthesis of series of substituted OAPPDO derivatives with different N&#8208;substitution patterns (H, alkyl, benzyl) in the peri positions, including bay&#8208;chlorinated OAPPDOs. Starting from the latter, a series of bay&#8208;arylated OAPPDOs was synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling, which resulted in the formation of helically chiral OAPPDO derivatives. The electrochemical and photophysical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. The P and M enantiomers of a phenylated OAPPDO were separated by semipreparative HPLC and further analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies, the mechanism of the isomerization, the electronic excitation and the CD spectrum (TD&#8208;DFT) were computed and compared to the experimental data. The reversible 1e&#8722; oxidation of the OAPPDOs generates the corresponding radical cations, one of which was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The reversible oxidation process was also systematically investigated by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry.

         <title>Understanding of Photo&#8208;Induced Reversible Rearrangement from Borepin to Borirane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 53, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;reference calculations with the CASPT2//CASSCF method have established detailed mechanisms for the photo&#8208;induced reversible isomerization between a borepin and a borirane, in which the (S1/S0)x intersection seam plays crucial roles.







Abstract
The first reversible photoisomerization between a borepin and a borirane was reported in the photo&#8208;induced reactions of B(npy)Ar2 (npy=2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl) pyridine, Ar=phenyl or electron rich aryl; S. Wang, et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 6683&#8211;6687). In this work, the detailed mechanisms of the unprecedented reversible photoisomerization between the borepin (compound a) and the borirane (compound b) of B(npy)Ph2 in the first excited singlet (S1) state and the ground (S0) state were studied by carrying out calculations with the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field (CASSCF) and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2) methods combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT). The calculation results show that photoexcitation of a&#8208;S0 at 365&#8197;nm and b&#8208;S0 at 450&#8197;nm populate their S1 state with evident charge transfer characteristics. The photoisomerization is triggered in the S1 state and ends in the S0 state, at which the intersection points in a (S1/S0)x intersection seam participate in and promote phenyl migration and ring&#8208;closure processes. Furthermore, we reveal that the not large energy difference (less than 0.6&#8197;eV) and similar conjugation properties of &#960; electrons between a&#8208;S0 and b&#8208;S0 are responsible for their unique photo&#8208;reversible reactivity, compared with those of the isomers of the thermally reversible compound B(ppy)Mes2. Our results contribute to an understanding of the excited&#8208;state reactivity of organoboron compounds and will be useful to support the design of new boron&#8208;based photo&#8208;responsive materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-reference calculations&lt;/b&gt; with the CASPT2//CASSCF method have established detailed mechanisms for the photo-induced reversible isomerization between a borepin and a borirane, in which the (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; intersection seam plays crucial roles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reversible photoisomerization between a borepin and a borirane was reported in the photo-induced reactions of B(npy)Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (npy=2-(naphthalen-1-yl) pyridine, Ar=phenyl or electron rich aryl; S. Wang, et&#8197;al. &lt;i&gt;Angew. Chem. Int. Ed&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;2019&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;58&lt;/i&gt;, 6683&#8211;6687). In this work, the detailed mechanisms of the unprecedented reversible photoisomerization between the borepin (compound &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) and the borirane (compound &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;) of B(npy)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the first excited singlet (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) state and the ground (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) state were studied by carrying out calculations with the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and its second-order perturbation (CASPT2) methods combined with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The calculation results show that photoexcitation of &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at 365&#8197;nm and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at 450&#8197;nm populate their S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state with evident charge transfer characteristics. The photoisomerization is triggered in the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state and ends in the S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; state, at which the intersection points in a (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; intersection seam participate in and promote phenyl migration and ring-closure processes. Furthermore, we reveal that the not large energy difference (less than 0.6&#8197;eV) and similar conjugation properties of &#960; electrons between &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are responsible for their unique photo-reversible reactivity, compared with those of the isomers of the thermally reversible compound B(ppy)Mes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results contribute to an understanding of the excited-state reactivity of organoboron compounds and will be useful to support the design of new boron-based photo-responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From CsKTaF7 to CsNaTaF7: Alkali Metal Cations Regulation to Generate SHG Activity
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 53, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;alkali metal tantalum fluorides CsATaF7 (A=K, Na) were synthesized by hydrothermal reactions based on the parent compounds A2MF7 (A=monovalent cations and M&#8208;d0 transition&#8208;metal cation). Interesting structure transformation for &#946;&#8208;K2TaF7, CsKTaF7, and CsNaTaF7 are induced via alkali metal cation regulations. Among them, CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in polar structure and own moderate SHG effect.







Abstract
Inorganic metal halides play important roles in wide range of areas including fluorescence, X&#8208;ray detection, and nonlinear&#8208;optics. Herein, two new mixed alkali metal tantalum fluorides, CsKTaF7 and CsNaTaF7, have been obtained based on the strategy of cations regulation in A2MF7 (A represents monovalent cations and M is d0 transition&#8208;metal cation) system by a conventional hydrothermal route. CsKTaF7 crystallizes in the centric Pnma space group, while CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in the polar Cmc21 space group and exhibits moderate and phase&#8208;matchable NLO activity. Both halides possess large optical band gaps above 5.0&#8197;eV. The crystal structure evolution, optical properties, and detailed theory calculations of these two halides were elucidated in this work.

A BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;induced self&#8208;condensation and coordination method from a single starting material has been developed, which has been studied by experiment and calculation. This gave a parent borondifluoride di(1H&#8208;pyrrolyl)butenone, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated derivatives of which were constructed as a new type of NIR chromophore with favorable photophysical properties based on the intramolecular charge transfer effect.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2 complexes with five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered core rings have been thoroughly investigated. However, the development of seven&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;boron complexes is still an area to be explored. We have developed BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;induced self&#8208;condensation and coordination reactions based on a single starting material, which had been elucidated by experiment and calculation. This parent asymmetric core&#8208;expanded borondifluoride&#8208;(Z)&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)but&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one (BOPYO) showed reactivity with a wide range of aldehydes, thus providing a series of conjugation BOPYOs. Moreover, a BOPYO derivative with a dimethylamino group was developed as a new NIR dye that responds to acid with favorable photophysical properties based on intramolecular charge transfer effect.

         <dc:description>
Intramolecular hydrogen bonds play an important role in the fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;aminophenyl pyridines, shifting the emission colour from deep blue to cold white. These multi&#8208;emissive dynamic systems bearing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) moieties are susceptible to pH. The cover feature illustrates how DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations can elucidate why different levels of protonation lead to different emission colours. Photochemists are depicted as sailing through the waves of a spectrum. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;M.&#8197;S. Silva, S. Guieu, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201844).

Abracadabra! Homolytic bond cleavage enabled by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer makes us think of a thioxanthone wizard who performs her magic when being excited in the spotlight. She transfers the energy with her wand to the vinyl triflimides thus inducing homolytic N&#8722;S bond cleavage to reveal radicals. Just like the divided woman, these recombine leading to &#945;&#8208;quaternary&#8208;&#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.

Unprecedented high molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles were revealed in 1,3&#8208;butadiyne bridged pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophanes. The angle and flexibility of the pseudo&#8208;meta substituents enabled high yielding macrocyclization reactions, and the studied trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric and hexameric structures further displayed astonishing through&#8208;space polymer&#8208;like conjugation lengths.

The positive muon (&#956;+) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been useful for study of radical reactions of organic compounds through formation of muonium (Mu=[&#956;+e&#8211;]). This article overviews the Muon Spin Rotation/Resonance (&#956;SR) studies of the phosphorus congeners of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls. The hydrogen surrogate enabled characterization of the regioselective radical additions producing the particular paramagnetic organophosphorus molecules.







Abstract
The positive muon (&#956;+) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been an important tool to study radical reactions of organic compounds. Recently, muons have been applied to produce short&#8208;lived paramagnetic species from the heavier unsaturated organic molecules including the p&#8208;block elements. This article overviews recent muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies on the phosphorus analogs of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls together with the fundamentals of &#956;SR. The acyclic phosphaalkene of P=C and phosphasilenes of P=Si can accept muonium (Mu=[&#956;+e&#8722;]) at the heavier double bonds, and the corresponding radicals have been characterized. The phosphorus atom in 9&#8208;phosphaanthracene, whose P=C double bond is stabilized by the peri&#8208;substituted CF3 groups, predominantly captures muonium to provide the corresponding paramagnetic fused heterocyclic system. The peri&#8208;trifluoromethyl groups are functional to promote the unprecedented light isotope effect of muon providing the planar three&#8208;cyclic molecular structure to consume the increased zero&#8208;point energy. The formally open&#8208;shell singlet 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diyl unit can accept muonium at the (ylidic) phosphorus or the skeletal radicalic carbon, and the corresponding paramagnetic phosphorus heterocycles can be characterized by &#956;SR. The findings on these muoniation processes to the unsaturated phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds will contribute not only to development of novel paramagnetic functional species but also to progress on muon science.

&#8220;The introduction of pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs into carbon&#8208;based macrocycles allowed us to obtain four enantiopure polygon&#8208;shaped structures in high yield, displaying unprecedented large molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and high absorption dissymmetry factors.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Marcel Mayor at the University of Basel with co&#8208;workers Olaf Fuhr and Dieter Fenske from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The image depicts the studied all&#8208;carbon polygon shaped macrocycles along with their intense circular dichroism spectra in the background. The bright light within the macrocycles displays its efficient conjugation. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764.

         <title>Photophysics of Anionic Bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, the photophysical behavior of four panchromatically absorbing, homoleptic bis(4  H  &#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes, with a systematic variation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the imidazolate ligand, were studied by wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Excitation at 400, 480, and 630 nm populates metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer, intra&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer as well as mixed character singlet states. The pump wavelength&#8208;dependent transient absorption data are analyzed by a recently established 2D correlation approach. The data analysis reveals that all excitation conditions yield similar excited state dynamics. Key to the excited&#8208;state relaxation is fast, subpicosecond pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, which is accompanied by re&#8208;localization of electron density onto a single ligand from the initially delocalized state at Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. The subsequent intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold is followed by a sub&#8208;100 ps decay to the ground state. The fast, non&#8208;radiative decay is rationalized by the low triplet state energy as found by DFT calculations, which suggest the perspective treatment in the strong coupling limit of the energy &#8232;gap law.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The new diaminoacetylene (DAA) dimorpholinoacetylene (  3  ) was prepared from 1,1&#8208;dimorpholinoethene (  1  ) by bromination to form the dibromoketene aminal  2  , which upon lithiation afforded  3  through a Fritsch&#8208;Buttenberg&#8208;Wiechell rearrangement.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Liquid Crystal Dimers Bridged with a Phosphonic Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal (LC) dimers with well&#8208;defined composition and structure arouse broad attentions for their exhibiting LC properties beyond conventional low molar mass mesogens and serving as fascinating model compounds for LC polymers. Here in this work, a series of LC dimers bridged with a phosphonic group have been synthesized through a facile free radical mediated addition reaction between hypophosphorous acid and vinyl terminated cyanobiphenyl mesogens with variant length alkyl spacers. In addition, two esterified derivatives and a group of mono&#8208;addition homologues with a terminal phosphonic acid group have also been prepared for comparison study. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit monotropic nematic (N) phase with typical schlieren textures except for the LC dimer with the longest eleven&#8208;methylene spacer, which surprisingly shows twist&#8208;bend nematic (N  TB  ) phase directly from the isotropic state upon cooling. Moreover, the thermal transition properties such as the nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and associated entropy changes of the series LC dimers display a modest odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, both the LC dimers and the mono&#8208;addition homologues in N phase are quite easy to achieve homeotropic alignment upon annealing thanks to the supramolecular interactions between the introduced phosphonic acid group and the hydroxylated glass surface. This work thus provides a novel synthesis strategy for a class of LC materials bridged with a phosphonic acid group prone to further functionalization, which may serve as promising vertical alignment agents and pave the way for developing a new kind of functionalized LC materials of N  TB  phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Urease by Hydroquinones: A Structural and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into a flap: Hydroquinones inhibit urease by covalently binding to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. The inhibition occurs through an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Hydroquinones are a class of organic compounds abundant in nature that result from the full reduction of the corresponding quinones. Quinones are known to efficiently inhibit urease, a NiII&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonate and acts as a virulence factor of several human pathogens, in addition to decreasing the efficiency of soil organic nitrogen fertilization. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the inhibition of urease from Sporosarcina pasteurii (SPU) and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean, JBU) by 1,4&#8208;hydroquinone (HQ) and its methyl and tert&#8208;butyl derivatives. The 1.63&#8208;&#197; resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the SPU&#8208;HQ complex discloses that HQ covalently binds to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. Inhibition kinetic data obtained for the three compounds on JBU reveals the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>The Sulfur Rich Fluorothiophosphate Dianions [S5P2F2]2&#8722; and [S3PF]2&#8722; : Cluster and Chelation Control of P&#8208;S Heterolysis</title>

Coordination of difluoropentathiophosphate to d10 metals results in either simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination or P&#8722;S heterolysis and capping of fluorotrithiophosphate in trinuclear and octanuclear cadmium and copper clusters. These new complexes may see use as metallothionein mimicks or in capping of CdS semiconductors.







Abstract
The sulfur rich difluoropentathiodiphosphate dianion [S5P2F2]2&#8722;, from fluoride addition to P4S10, has a somewhat checkered history and proves to be the main product of the reaction in acetonitrile. Its optimized synthesis, and structural characterization, as either a tetraphenylphosphonium or a tetrapropylammonium salt, [NnPr4]2[S5P2F2] allows for the first coordination chemistry for this dianion. Reactions of [S5P2F2]2&#8722; with d10 metal ions of zinc(II), and cadmium(II), and d9 copper(II) resulted in a surprising diverse array of binding modes and structural motifs. In addition to the simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination of [S5P2F2]2&#8722; with zinc, cleavage of the P&#8722;S bond resulted in complexes with the unusual [S3PF]2&#8722; fluorotrithiophosphate dianion. This was observed in two cluster complexes: a trinuclear cadmium complex with mixed [S5P2F2]2&#8722;/[S3PF]2&#8722; ligands, [Cd3(S5P2F2)3(S3PF)2]4&#8722; as well as an octanuclear copper cluster, [Cu8(S3PF)6]4&#8722; which form rapidly at room temperature. These new metal/sulfur/ligand clusters are of relevance to understanding multimetal binding to metallothionines, and to potential capping strategies for the condensed nanoparticulate cadmium chalcogenide semiconductors CdS and CdSe.

         <title>Evidence for multiple binding modes in the initial contact between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and cell surface glycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infection of host cells by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 begins with recognition by the virus S (spike) protein of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), tethering the virus to the extracellular matrix environment, and causing the subunit S1&#8208;RBD to undergo a conformational change into the &#8216;open&#8217; conformation. These two events promote the binding of S1&#8208;RBD to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a preliminary step toward viral&#8208;cell membrane fusion. Combining ligand&#8208;based NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics, oligosaccharide analogues were used to explore the interactions between S1&#8208;RBD of SARS CoV&#8208;2 and HS, revealing several low&#8208;specificity binding modes and previously unidentified potential sites for the binding of extended HS polysaccharide chains. The evidence for multiple binding modes also suggest that highly specific inhibitors will not be optimal against protein S but, rather, diverse HS&#8208;based structures, characterized by high affinity and including multi&#8208;valent compounds, may be required.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches (PTS)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a quaterthiophene and sexithiophene that can reversibly change their effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation length  via  photoexcitation. The reported compounds make use of light&#8208;responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker&#8208;assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350 nm light the azobenzene undergoes  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  isomerization mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformations (extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Exposure to 254 nm wavelenght promotes azobenzene  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  thermal relaxation with rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized using steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis, X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical modelling. Finally, we tested the proposed light&#8208;responsive oligothiophenes into field&#8208;effect transistors to probe the photo&#8208;induced tuning of their electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wavelength&#8208;independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We disclosed that the  Z&#8211;E  photoisomerization of the meta&#8208;bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength&#8208;independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic nitrene transfer by an FeIV imido complex generated by a comproportionation process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrene transfer reactions have emerged among the most powerful and versatile ways to insert an amine function to various kinds of hydrocarbon substrates. However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from Fe  II  and Fe  III  precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous vs ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, an Fe  IV  tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the Fe  II  precursor was expected by a two&#8208;electron oxidative addition, its formation from a Fe  III  precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the Fe  III  precursor, an Fe  III  tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an Fe  V  tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active Fe  IV  tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the Fe  III  precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodicarbenes and Striking Redox Transitions of their Conjugate Acids: Influence of NHC vs. CAAC as Donor Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a new type of carbodicarbene (CDC) comprising two different classes of carbenes; NHC and CAAC as donor substituents and compare the molecular structure and coordination to Au(I)Cl to those of NHC&#8208;only and CAAC&#8208;only analogues. The conjugate acids of these three CDCs exhibit notable redox properties. Their reactions with [NO][SbF6] were investigated. The reduction of the conjugate acid of CAAC&#8208;only based CDC with KC 8 results in the formation of hydrogen abstracted/eliminated products which proceed through a neutral radical intermediate, detected by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduction of conjugate acids of NHC&#8208;only and NHC/CAAC based CDCs led to intermolecular reductive (reversible) carbon&#8208;carbon sigma bond formation. The resulting relatively elongated carbon&#8208;carbon sigma bonds were found to be readily oxidized. They were, thus, demonstrated to be potent reducing agents, underlining their potential utility as organic electron donors and n&#8208;dopants in organic semiconductor molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrocatalysis is the most promising strategy to generate clean energy H2  , and the development of catalysts with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at high current density that can resist strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte environment is great significance for practical industrial application.

         <dc:description>We report an electrophotochemical dual metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for decarboxylative arylation of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with aryl halides. The relative stabilities of catalytically active metal complexes simultaneously generated at anode and cathode are the key design elements for the success of this convergent paired electrolysis. This new electrophotocatalytic method is mild, robust, and most importantly, capable of accommodating simple primary aliphatic acids including acetic acid&#8212;ubiquitous and variegated structural motifs yet remain oddly challenging substrates&#8212;directly as native functional groups for decarboxylative C(sp 2 )&#8211;C(sp 3 ) bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porous Polyaromatic Solid for Vapor Adsorption of Xylene with High Efficiency, Selectivity, and Reusability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of porous materials capable of capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene and its derivatives, with high efficiency, selectivity, and reusability is highly demanded. Here we report unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs by a new porous solid, composed of a polyaromatic capsule bearing a spherical nanocavity with subnano&#8208;sized windows. Without prior crystallization and high&#8208;temperature vacuum drying, the porous polyaromatic solids exhibit the following five features: vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90% selectivity, high affinity toward  o  &#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80% selectivity,  ortho  &#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50%) from mixed xylene isomers, tight VOCs storage even under high temperature and vacuum conditions, and at least 5 times reusability for xylene adsorption. The observed adsorption abilities are accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure within 1 h, which has not been demonstrated by organic/inorganic porous materials reported previously.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Achiral Phosphine Ligands on a Synergistic Organo&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an unusual diastereodivergent stereoselective allylation reaction. It consists of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of an organocatalytically generated amino isobenzofulvene, where the diastereoselectivity is controlled by the electronic properties of a monodentate, achiral ligand on palladium. One major diastereoisomer is formed using triarylphosphines substituted with neutral or electron&#8208;donating substituents of the aryl group, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents favor the other diastereoisomer. The diastereoselectivity correlates with the Taft inductive parameter of substituents on the triarylphosphine ligand on palladium. The synergistic reaction involves both a catalytic secondary amine catalyst for the indene&#8208;aldehyde activation and the monodentate phosphine ligands on palladium, affording a highly enantioselective reaction with up to 98% enantiomeric excess. Based on computational investigations, the role of the monodentate phosphine ligand on the diastereoselectivity is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Propeller Chirality in Triaryl Boranes with Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Stabilization of chiral propeller conformations in triaryl compounds is challenging due to generally low racemization barriers. Nonetheless, it was recently found that chiral conformational preferences can be induced to triaryl boranes by incorporating point&#8208;chiral alkylether chains to the aryl blades and subsequently locking the structure with ammonia. A four&#8208;point interaction, that means the cooperative effects of Lewis&#8208;adduct formation and three hydrogen bonds, was proposed as stabilizing mechanism. Herein, we show that three such strong interactions suffice to introduce a preferential propeller handedness. While DFT calculations predict no noteworthy preferences for either P&#8208; or M&#8208;chiral propellers for some of the investigated triarylborane&#8208;amine adducts that were prepared with chiral primary amines, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic characterizations revealed that there is indeed a measurable excess of one propeller handedness. Furthermore, the steric demand of the amine was found to play a key role in the induction process and especially in preventing blade rotations.</dc:description>

         <title>Peri&#8208;Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes: Strong Emitters for Molecular Polaritonics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of the  peri  position of the  bay  chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the  peri  position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BPh3 smoothly catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline with CO2 and PhSiH3. A zwitterionic carbamate, composed of N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2, and BPh3 act as nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce the silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal that are essential for N&#8208;methylation.







Abstract
BPh3 catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of secondary amines and the C&#8208;methylenation (methylene&#8208;bridge formation between aromatic rings) of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or 1&#8208;methylindoles in the presence of CO2 and PhSiH3; these reactions proceed at 30&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In contrast, B(C6F5)3 shows little or no activity. 11B&#8197;NMR spectra suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722;. The detailed mechanism of the BPh3&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline (1) with CO2 and PhSiH3 was studied by using DFT calculations. BPh3 promotes the conversion of two substrates (N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2) into a zwitterionic carbamate to give three&#8208;component species [Ph(Me)(H)N+CO2&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;BPh3]. The carbamate and BPh3 act as the nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce key CO2&#8208;derived species, such as silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal, essential for the N&#8208;methylation of 1. DFT calculations also suggested other mechanisms involving water for the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722; species.

         <title>Thioxanthylium Cations: Highly Reversible Hydrochromic Mate&#8208;rials with Tunable Color and Moisture Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrochromism of thioxanthylium cations/ thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol can be tuned by structural functionalization to offer diverse colors and moisture&#8208;sensitivities. This reversible hydrochromic system is easily activated with organic acid from chemically stable precursors, allowing for possible uses in moisture&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting encryption.







Abstract
Hydrochromic materials, which change color in response to moisture, are highly sought&#8208;after due to some unique applications such as moisture detection, humidity monitoring, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and sweat&#8208;pore mapping. We herein report a new thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ols/thioxanthylium cations hydrochromic system. The hydrochromic thioxanthylium cations can be generated/regenerated by exposing a chemically stable thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The intensely colored thioxanthylium cations can be chemically reverted to the colorless thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol. Interestingly, the conversion between thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol and its cation species was found to be highly reversible in most cases (up to 50 activation&#8208;deactivation cycles). The color and moisture&#8208;sensitivity of thioxanthylium cations were also validated to be tunable via functionalization of the thioxanthene core with different aliphatic and aromatic groups at its 9 or 2,7&#8208;positions. Finally, paper probes were prepared using solution&#8208;immersion and inkjet&#8208;printing techniques to demonstrate the system's potential applications in humidity sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting

         <title>An Optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Type Coupling: Enantioretentive Access to Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;N bond formation takes on a critical significance in reactions of organic synthesis, material production and pharmaceutical manufactory. Chan&#8208;Lam has proposed a useful methodology to furnish secondary arylamides under mild conditions. However, when the chiral sulfinamides serve as the coupling precursors, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction is found with low efficacy. Complex side products are generated under the classic conditions. Moreover, it led to the racemization of the coupling product. In this study, an optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling conditions were optimized, which resulted in a clean conversion with chiral sulfinamides and arylboronic acids to offer N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides efficiently and enantioretentively. The trans&#8208;N  1  ,N  2  &#8208;dimethylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine were proven as the most efficient ligand. Under the optimized conditions, serious chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides were prepared with high chemical yield without racemization. Furthermore, a plausible and novel mechanism was proposed. Interestingly, the method could efficiently furnish a wide variety of C&#8208;X bonds by coupling arylboronic acids with different Nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, pnictogen (Pn)&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones were synthesized as motifs for photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. The newly synthesized sulfones exhibited dual fluorescence at 298 K. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence was derived from the geometries after structural relaxation through photo&#8208;driven pnictogen bond formation between the O atom lone pair of the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8211;C bond.

         <title>Acridone&#8208;Based Host Materials for Green Phosphorescent and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent OLEDs with Low&#8208; Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By linking carbazole unit to nitrogen atom of acridone through phenyl and or pyridyl, two compounds , named 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz) and 10&#8208;(5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz) were designed and synthesized. These two materials, characterized with highly twisted and rigid structure, good thermal stability, and balanced carrier&#8208;transporting properties, were employed as host materials for green phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Carbazole group, despite its small contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these two materials, plays an essential role as an intramolecular host in energy delivering and improving the hole transporting ability of these two hosts. The incorporation of the electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl as a linking group slightly improve s the electron transporting capability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz . The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5 V, maximum power efficiency and external quantum efficiency (  &#951;  ext  ) of 89.8 lm W  &#8208;1  and 25.2%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge balancing ability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz host due to the presence of pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness due to the suppressed non&#8208;radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 1.6% from the maximum &#951;ext at a high brightness of 1000 cd m  &#8208;2  and a roll&#8208;off of 15.9% at an extremely high brightness of 10000 cd m  &#8208;2  . This study manifests that acridone &#8208; based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Encapsulated Double&#8208;Cage [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722;: An Exception from Group 14 Endohedral Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group 14 endohedral clusters containing a metal center inside usually possess a single cage topological structure, but here we report an unexpected single&#8208;metal&#8208;filled double&#8208;cage cluster, [Pt@Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  (  1a  ). It can be seen as a combination of the more extended Pt&#8208;filled [Pt@Sn  9  ] cage and hollow [Sn  9  ] cage sharing a central Sn atom, which is offset from the central position. This double&#8208;cage species represents the largest group 14 intermetalloid cluster encapsulating a single transition metal atom. DFT calculations show that the capsule&#8208;like architecture of [Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  , similar to that found in [Pt  2  @Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  , is not thermodynamically stable if filled with a single Pt atom and collapses to the title cluster  1a  upon geometry optimization. Deviation of the central Sn atom occurs due to the vibronic coupling as a consequence of pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion leading to the bent  C  s  &#8208;symmetrical structure, in contrast to the more symmetrical  D  2d  cage previously reported in [Ni  2  @Sn  17  ]  4  &#8722;  .</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Enhanced Emission by Introducing Rational Photoactive Subunits into an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we propose a rational design strategy by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups into an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve highly efficient photochemistry&#8208;activated fluorescence enhancement from dominantly photo&#8208;physical aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, and prove that such photoactivated fluorescence enhancement is perfectly suited for super stable photocontrollable dual&#8208;mode patterning applications in both solution and solid matrix. It is found that the photoactivated fluorescence of designed AIEgen is attributed to the irreversible cyclized&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation, and the oxidation product has a brighter fluorescence in both solution and solid states owning to its rigid and planar structure. The overall transformation rate of the AIEgen from its opened form to dehydrogenated form is up to nearly 100% in a short period of UV irradiation, and the fast transformation and the stable product of this photochemical reaction guarantees super stability of photocontrolled patterning, which can be applied in photoactivated dual&#8208;mode patterning and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term, Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging of Proteins in Live Cells with Photoregulated Fluxional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can reveal nanometric details of biological samples, but its high phototoxicity hampers long&#8208;term imaging in live specimens. A significant part of this phototoxicity stems from repeated irradiations that are necessary for controlled switching of fluorophores to maintain the sparse labeling of the sample. Lower phototoxicity can be obtained using fluorophores that blink spontaneously, but controlling the density of single&#8208;molecule emitters is challenging. We recently developed photoregulated fluxional fluorophores (PFFs) that combine the benefits of spontaneously blinking dyes with photocontrol of emitter density. These dyes, however, were limited to imaging acidic organelles in live cells. Here, we report a systematic study of PFFs that culminates in probes that are functional at physiological pH and operate at longer wavelengths than their predecessors. Moreover, these probes are compatible with HaloTag labeling, thus enabling timelapse, single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific protein targets for exceptionally long times.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Symmetrical BODIPYs via Fischer Carbene Complexes: Theoretical, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new symmetrical highly substituted BODIPYs  6a&#8208;l  was synthesized through a prefunctionalization approach in 35&#8208;89% yields from the pyrrole core. This strategy allowed modulation of the substituents at the different positions based on the choice of Fischer's alkynyl carbenes, oxazolones and aldehydes used as precursors. The substituent variation at positions 2, 6, 3 and 5 had the greatest effect on the modulation of their photophysical properties such as absorption (&#955;  abs  ) and emission (&#955;  em  ) wavelengths, extinction coefficient (&#949;), quantum yields (&#966;), Stokes shifts (&#916;&#957;), fluorescence decay, radiative (k  rad  ) and non&#8208;radiative (k  nr  ) constants and the CIE 1931 coordinates. Theoretical calculations allowed to corroborate the effect of the substituents of  meso  &#8208;position on the modification of the dihedral angles. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the BODIPY series presents similar redox potential behavior, being electrochemically active even in successive cycles, which suggests that transport by diffusion is the dominant process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Accessible and Reactive Sites in Gold Nanoparticles Using Bound Bis(diphenylphosphine) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While bound organic ligands provide steric protection against aggregation for metallic nanoparticles in solution, they can block a large fraction of the surface atoms which are needed for binding in catalysis and sensing applications. In this work, highly accessible Au nanoparticles ligated with bis(diphenylphosphine) molecules are synthesized and characterized in solution.&#160;&#160;Characterization is performed using high angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy, and fluorescence chemisorption experiments. These synthesized nanoparticles are accessible to a 2&#8208;napthalenethiol (2&#8208;NT) probe molecule in solution. The highest 2&#8208;NT accessibility is observed when using 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand where 61% of the total gold atoms are accessible. It is hypothesized that increasing the rigidity of the bis(diphenylphosphine) ligand increases the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticles.

In this work, highly accessible Au nanoparticles ligated with bis(diphenylphosphine) molecules are synthesized and characterized in solution.&#160;&#160;Characterization is performed using high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and fluorescence chemisorption experiments. These synthesized nanoparticles are accessible to a 2-napthalenethiol (2-NT) probe molecule in solution. The highest 2-NT accessibility is observed when using 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand where 61% of the total gold atoms are accessible. It is hypothesized that increasing the rigidity of the bis(diphenylphosphine) ligand increases the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are catalytically active for resazurin reduction, and the resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of the Coordinated Transition Metal Ion on Magnetic Relaxation of Lanthanide Based Complexes with Imino Nitroxide Biradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of biradical&#8208;metal complexes have been obtained by using an imino nitroxide biradical. Remarkably one magnetic process is found for the Dy&#8208;biradical compound while the Dy&#8722;Cu&#8208;radical compound exhibits dual relaxation processes which indicates that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a crucial role in magnetic relaxation behavior.







Abstract
In spite of achievement of a lot of Ln&#8208;radical SMMs, how to improve magnetic behavior of Ln&#8208;radical system remains challenging. Here, two series of Ln&#8208;radical complexes have successfully been built using an imino nitroxide biradical, namely, [Ln2(hfac)6(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 1, Tb 2, Dy 3) and [Ln2Cu2(hfac)10(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 4, Dy 5; hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate and ImPhPyobis=5&#8208;(4&#8208;oxypyridinium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8217;&#8208;oxyl&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene). For these biradical&#8208;metal complexes, two imino nitroxide biradicals bind two Ln(III) ions via their oxygen atoms coming from 4&#8208;oxypyridinium units to produce a binuclear {Ln2O2} unit. Those imino nitroxide groups are free for complexes 1&#8211;3, however one of imino nitroxide groups of the biradical is ligated to the copper(II) ion for complexes 4 and 5. The distinct magnetic relaxation behaviors are observed for two Dy derivatives, as revealed by ac magnetic studies: complex 3 presents one magnetic process with the effective energy barrier(Ueff) of 74.0&#8197;K while complex 5 exhibits dual relaxation processes with Ueff values for the fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;relaxation being 20.2&#8197;K and 30.9&#8197;K, respectively, which implies that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a critical role for magnetic relaxation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes through Intramolecular Chlorine Transfer as a Novel Strategy for Asymmetric Halopalladation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy for enantioselective halopalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established to build versatile and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones in excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity with good functional&#8208;group compatibility. This strategy provides a novel approach to asymmetric halopalladation and an alternative for synthesizing complex natural products.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of enynes has contributed significantly to the construction of chiral cyclic molecules. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric cyclization involving halopalladation remains an unresolved challenge with the inevitable disturbance of the halide ions. Herein, an intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy is used to accomplish the enantioselective chloropalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This reaction provides a redox&#8208;neutral approach to a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The precisely controlled coordination of palladium with both the in&#8197;situ generated nucleophilic species and the monodentate phosphoramidite ligand is crucial for enantioselectivity.

         <title>Using Macrocyclic G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands to Decipher the Interactions Between Small Molecules and G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Binding: This study aims to add a deeper level of knowledge to the binding interactions between G4&#8208;ligands and G4 DNA to advance the design of improved G4&#8208;ligands. This is achieved by biophysical and physicochemical evaluations complemented by computational studies of both novel and well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
This study aims to deepen the knowledge of the current state of rational G4&#8208;ligand design through the design and synthesis of a novel set of compounds based on indoles, quinolines, and benzofurans and their comparisons with well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands. This resulted in novel synthetic methods and G4&#8208;ligands that bind and stabilize G4 DNA with high selectivity. Furthermore, the study corroborates previous studies on the design of G4&#8208;ligands and adds deeper explanations to why a) macrocycles offer advantages in terms of G4&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity, b) molecular pre&#8208;organization is of key importance in the development of strong novel binders, c) an electron&#8208;deficient aromatic core is essential to engage in strong arene&#8208;arene interactions with the G4&#8208;surface, and d) aliphatic amines can strengthen interactions indirectly through changing the arene electrostatic nature of the compound. Finally, fundamental physicochemical properties of selected G4&#8208;binders are evaluated, underscoring the complexity of aligning the properties required for efficient G4 binding and stabilization with feasible pharmacokinetic properties.

         <title>&#8220;Crystal memory&#8221; Affects the Properties of Peptide Hydrogels &#8211; The Case of the Cyclic Tyr&#8208;Tyr dipeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Peptide self&#8208;assembling: Both, solid&#8208;state form and stereochemistry significantly influence a self&#8208;assembly process of a cyclic dipeptide, Tyr&#8208;Tyr (cYY), leading to a soft matter with different morphology and rheological properties.







Abstract
In this work a relationship between the crystal form and morphology and rheological properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels is examined. We show, that under favorable circumstances a correlation between a starting solid material and a self&#8208;assembly processes in solution can exist, leading to different properties of a resulting soft matter. This observation, together with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the influence of stereochemistry of self&#8208;assembled (ll) and (dl) Tyr&#8208;Tyr cyclic dipeptides (cYY) on the observed relationship between gelation and crystallization allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the peptide hydrogelation processes at a molecular level, using liquid state NMR, rheological studies and scanning electron microscopy. In the course of our studies, several crystal forms of (ll)&#8208;cYY has been discovered and described in details using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as advanced solid state NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction of powders, thermal analysis, FTIR, circular dichroism and crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations. Subsequently, we found that while (ll)&#8208;cYY easily assembles into hydrogels with different properties depending on the starting solid form, (dl)&#8208;cYY always precipitated as one crystal form in the tested conditions. Molecular&#8208;level justification for this observation is given.

         <dc:description>
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. Developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods is one of the most effective strategies to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions and thus to limit global warming. Challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal are analyzed.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH4 emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5&#8201;&#176;C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions by developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH4 (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale.

         <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of [FeII(Atrz)3]SO4 and its Analogues Through Accelerated Ageing: New Insights from Small&#8208;Scale Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated ageing can be used to synthesize functional materials including spin crossover systems. Reactions proceed between a metal salt and a ligand placed in contact in a humid environment without any solvent or applied energy. Optical microscopy of small&#8208;scale reactions can be used to derive mechanistic information about accelerated ageing.







Abstract
Accelerated ageing reactions that take place between two solid materials on contact in the absence of added solvent have been used to synthesize two spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active 1D coordination polymers and one of their Cu(II) analogues. The hygroscopy of the ligands and the relative humidity of the reaction chamber have been shown to be particularly important factors in the rate of reaction. Small&#8208;scale reactions between a few individual crystals have allowed observation of deliquescence of the 4&#8208;aminotriazole ligand at high humidity. The metal salt does not dissolve, and the ligand diffuses into the crystal of the metal salt during the reaction. In the case of the Cu analogue, the formation of the product causes the crystal of the metal salt to deform with the formation of pseudocrystals, which have a fibrous structure.

         <title>Design of a Photocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition Reaction Using Redox&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on our Redox&#8208;Tag strategy was developed involving carefully designed substrates which turned out to be effective for the reaction. A radical cation was formed by oxidative single electron transfer (SET) that immediately reacted with an alkene. An aryl radical cation was generated by intramolecular SET and during the subsequent reductive SET a cyclobutane was formed.







Abstract
The design of photocatalytic processes is important for a sustainable society. Key to these photocatalytic reactions is electron transfer. This article is focused on titanium dioxide photocatalyzed organic synthesis and the design of a new [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on the electron transfer process. Electron transfer &#8208; not only between the substrate and the photocatalyst but also inter&#8208; and intramolecularly &#8211; is crucial for the reaction design. Radical cations were generated by the photocatalyst and trapped by alkenes. The resultant cyclobutyl radical cations were immediately reduced by the aryl rings via intramolecular electron transfer to obtain cyclobutane rings. The outcome of the reaction was controlled by substitution of the aryl ring and the linker connecting the aryl ring to the enol ether. The carefully designed substrates were highly effective for photocatalytic cycloaddition.

         <title>Substituted Cyclopentannulated Tetraazapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bromine substituents into cyclopentannulated tetraazapentacenes allows post&#8208;functionalization, for example through Sonogashira coupling and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun reaction. The altered properties of the resulting new compounds were examined by experimental and computational methods, and the potential use as organic field&#8208;effect transistors was demonstrated.







Abstract
Brominated pentannulated dihydrotetraazapentacenes were prepared by gold&#8208; or palladium&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of TIPS&#8208;ethynylated dihydrotetraazaacenes (TIPS = triisopropylsilyl). Post&#8208;functionalization was demonstrated by Sonogashira alkynylation and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun cyanation. Calculations predict these species to act as n&#8208;type semiconductors, which was verified for two derivates through characterization in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Structural Insights into the Very Low Activity of the Homocoenzyme B12 Adenosylmethylcobalamin in Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase and Ethanolamine Ammonia&#8208;Lyase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray structures of diol dehydratase (DD) and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL) complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) were determined to get insights into the very low activity of AdoMeCbl. The DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that leave DD in the inactive state (left). The EAL active site is rigid and its binding does not induce significant conformational change (right).







Abstract
The X&#8208;ray structures of coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl)&#8208;dependent eliminating isomerases complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) have been determined. As judged from geometries, the Co&#8722;C bond in diol dehydratase (DD) is not activated even in the presence of substrate. In ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL), the bond is elongated in the absence of substrate; in the presence of substrate, the complex likely exists in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;homolysis states. The impacts of incorporating an extra CH2 group are different in the two enzymes: the DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that make DD unable to adopt the catalytic state, whereas the EAL active site is rigid, and AdoMeCbl binding does not induce significant conformational changes. Such flexibility and rigidity of the active sites might reflect the tightness of adenine binding. The structures provide good insights into the basis of the very low activity of AdoMeCbl in these enzymes.

         <title>Cu3(HHTP)2 c&#8208;MOF/ZnO Ultrafast Ultraviolet Photodetector for Wearable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable ultraviolet photodetector based on 2D c&#8208;MOF Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction is fabricated by Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the photodetector shows superior photoresponse and outstanding mechanical durability.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2&#8197;A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1&#8197;V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self&#8208;powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70&#8197;&#956;s, which is the record value for MOF&#8208;based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000&#8208;time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF&#8208;based UV photodetector with anti&#8208;fatigue and anti&#8208;bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Substrate&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Inversion in Amphiphilic, Biocompatible Glycoconjugate Supramolecules: Shape&#8208;Persistent Gelation, Self&#8208;Healing, and Antibacterial Activity</title>

Sometimes things just gel: Glycoconjugate (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco in which a d&#8208;glucosamine moiety was attached to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus showed hierarchical self&#8208;aggregation leading to the formation of transparent, injectable, and biocompatible hydrogel. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco nanocomposite hydrogel bearing AgNPs can be applied topically as an antibacterial soft material. Solvent&#8208;dependent chiral inversion was demonstrated in the aggregates of a (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco&#8208;bearing l&#8208;leucine unit.







Abstract
We have shown solvent&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent chiral inversion of a few glycoconjugate supramolecules. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco, in which d&#8208;glucosamine has been attached chemically to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus, forms a self&#8208;healing hydrogel through intertwining of the nanofibers wherein the gelators undergo lamellar packing in the &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures with a single chiral handedness. Dihybrid (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco nanocomposite gel was prepared by in&#8208;situ formation of silver nanoparticles AgNPs in the gel; this enhances the mechanical properties of the composite gel through physical crosslinking without altering the packing pattern. In contrast, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco bearing an l&#8208;leucine moiety does not form a hydrogel but an organogel. Interestingly, the chiral handedness of the aggregates of (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco can be reversed by choosing suitable solvents. In addition to self&#8208;healing behavior, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco gel revealed shape persistency. Further, (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel is benign, nontoxic, non&#8208;immunogenic, and non&#8208;allergenic in animal cells. AgNP&#8208;loaded (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel showed antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Coupling Reactions of Dinitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Mediated by Monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722;&#8901;Anions: Carbon&#8722;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions mediated C&#8722;N coupling reactions with inert N2 and CO2 under plasma conditions have been reported. Anionic products NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722; were generated, accompanied by the production of neutral products of YO and YB0&#8211;2NC. This strategy may provide a new approach to realize the N2 and CO2 coupling reactions at room temperature.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed coupling to form C&#8722;N bonds is significant in chemical science. However, the inert nature of N2 and CO2 renders their coupling quite challenging. Herein, we report the activation of dinitrogen in the mild plasma atmosphere by the gas&#8208;phase monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions and further coupling of CO2 to form C&#8722;N bonds by using mass spectrometry and theoretical calculation. The observed product anions are NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722;, accompanied by the formation of neutral products YO and YB0&#8211;2NC, respectively. We can tune the reactivity and the type of products by manipulating the number of B atoms. The B atoms in YB1&#8211;4N2&#8722; act as electron donors in CO2 reduction reactions, and the carbon atom originating from CO2 serves as an electron reservoir. This is the first example of gas&#8208;phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N2 with CO2 through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>The Unprecedented [S4N2O10]2&#8722; Anion in the Molecular Gold Complexes [Au2Br2(S4N2O10)2] and [Au2Cl2(S4N2O10)2](S2O5Cl2)</title>

         <dc:description>
The cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, is reported in dimeric gold complexes for the first time. The anion can be interpreted as the condensation product of two sulfate anions and two amidosulfate anions. The applied solvothermal synthesis between SO3, P3N3Cl6 and metal salts is a promising route to obtain novel nitrogen&#8208;containing sulfates.







Abstract
The reaction of hexachlorophosphazene, P3N3Cl6, with SO3 and the gold halides AuCl3 and AuBr3, respectively, leads to the new cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, which is coordinated to Au3+ in the dimeric complexes [Au2X2(S4N2O10)2] (X=Cl, Br). The [S4N2O10]2&#8722; anion can be seen as the condensation product of two sulfate anions, [SO4]2&#8722;, and two amidosulfate anions, [NH2SO3]&#8722;.

         <title>Microscopic Reactivity of Phenylferrate Ions toward Organyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of phenylferrate ions toward organyl halides is studied by a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. The thus obtained results offer a sharp glimpse at the elementary step of the oxidative addition and help to improve our fundamental understanding of iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
Despite its practical importance, organoiron chemistry remains poorly understood due to its mechanistic complexity. Here, we focus on the oxidative addition of organyl halides to phenylferrate anions in the gas phase. By mass&#8208;selecting individual phenylferrate anions, we can determine the effect of the oxidation state, the ligation, and the nuclearity of the iron complex on its reactions with a series of organyl halides RX. We find that Ph2Fe(I)&#8722; and other low&#8208;valent ferrates are more reactive than Ph3Fe(II)&#8722;; Ph4Fe(III)&#8722; is inert. The coordination of a PPh3 ligand or the presence of a second iron center lower the reactivity. Besides direct cross&#8208;coupling reactions resulting in the formation of RPh, we also observe the abstraction of halogen atoms. This reaction channel shows the readiness of organoiron species to undergo radical&#8208;type processes. Complementary DFT calculations afford further insight and rationalize the high reactivity of the Ph2Fe(I)&#8722; complex by the exothermicity of the oxidative addition and the low barriers associated with this reaction step. At the same time, they point to the importance of changes of the spin state in the reactions of Ph3Fe(II)&#8722;.

         <title>Polymerization, Stimuli&#8208;induced Depolymerization, and Precipitation&#8208;driven Macrocyclization in a Nitroaldol Reaction System
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nitroaldol polymers of different topology is presented. Linear dynamers were generally produced, from which specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization, driven by precipitation. The dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymers of different topology have been synthesized from an aromatic dialdehyde and &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dinitroalkanes via the nitroaldol reaction. All dinitroalkanes yielded dynamers with the dialdehyde, where the length of the dinitroalkane chain played a vital role in determining the structure of the final products. For longer dinitroalkanes, linear dynamers were produced, where the degree of polymerization reached a plateau at higher feed concentrations. In the reactions involving 1,4&#8208;dinitrobutane and 1,5&#8208;dinitropentane, specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization of the linear chains, further driven by precipitation. At lower temperature, the same systemic self&#8208;sorting effect was also observed for the 1,6&#8208;dinitrohexane&#8208;based dynamers. Moreover, the dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.

         <title>Fast Cysteine Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently developed fast cysteine bioconjugation reactions are summarized in this Concept, with a focus on the mechanisms and design principles that underlie the high efficiency of the new cysteine&#8208;modifying reagents.







Abstract
Cysteine bioconjugation serves as a powerful tool in biological research and has been widely used for chemical modification of proteins, constructing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and enabling cell imaging studies. Cysteine conjugation reactions with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity have been under heavy pursuit as they would allow clean protein modification with just stoichiometric amounts of reagents, which minimizes side reactions, simplifies purification and broadens functional group tolerance. In this concept, we summarize the recent advances in fast cysteine bioconjugation, and discuss the mechanism and chemical principles that underlie the high efficiencies of the newly developed cysteine reactive reagents.

         <title>Intrinsic Regularity of Catalytic Cobalt Chalcogenides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery: Theoretical Study Delivers New Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical study delivers new insights into catalytic cobalt chalcogenides CoX2 (X=S, Se, Te) in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery. The polysulfides adsorption is mainly controled by relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity). The charging process (rather than discharging process) is mainly regulated to contribute to steady polysulfides conversion.







Abstract
Cobalt chalcogenides CoX2 (X=S, Se, Te) render great performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries based on catalytic capacity to alleviate shuttle effect. Given that S/Se/Te belong to the same main group, the outstanding cycling stability delivered by CoTe2 aroused the curiosity about the uniqueness of CoTe2 and intrinsic laws of cobalt chalcogenide. Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX2: the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX2 mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe2 are three&#8208;fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process. It is hope the results will facilitate the development of cobalt chalcogenides, especially tellurides as catalytic material in lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Thiazole Boron Difluoride Dyes with Large Stokes Shift, Solid State Emission and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five&#8208;membered boron difluoro complexes using a secondary amide as an anionic ligand display large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission. Dyes exhibiting room&#8208; temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in both amorphous and crystalline states are documented.







Abstract
The small Stokes shift and weak emission in the solid state are two main shortcomings associated with the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) family of dyes. This study presents the design, synthesis and luminescent properties of boron difluoro complexes of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;4&#8208;alkylaminocarbonylthiazoles. These dyes display Stokes shifts (&#916;&#955;, 77&#8211;101&#8197;nm) with quantum yields (&#981;FL) up to 64.9 and 34.7&#8201;% in toluene solution and in solid state, respectively. Some of these compounds exhibit dual fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission properties with modulable phosphorescence quantum yields (&#981;PL) and lifetime (&#964;p up to 251&#8197;&#956;s). The presence of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and negligible &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure might account for the observed large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission of these fluorophores, while the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of iodine and the self&#8208;assembly driven by halogen bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions could be responsible for the observed RTP of iodine containing phosphors.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aryl Substituted Isocoumarins and Phthalides through Palladium Acetate Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, high&#8208;throughput synthesis of isocoumarins and phthalides is presented. The reaction is carried out in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate (ionic liquid) which allows the use of an amount of palladium acetate from ten to twenty times lower than that of similar protocols in molecular solvents (0.5&#8201;% mol). Oxygen is used as a reoxidant for the metal, mediated by copper acetate.







Abstract
A novel Pd&#8208;catalysed oxidative coupling between benzoic acids and vinylarenes or acrylates to furnish isocoumarins and phthalides is reported. The reaction proceeds smoothly in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate via a selective C&#8722;H bond activation, with very low percentage of ligand&#8208;free palladium acetate as the catalyst, under atmospheric pressure of oxygen. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of copper acetate is also required as a reoxidant for the palladium.

         <title>Mitochondrial Targeting and Imaging with Small Organic Conjugated Fluorophores: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The last decade has seen an increasingly large number of studies reporting on the development of novel small organic conjugated systems for mitochondrial imaging exploiting optical signal transduction pathways. Mitochondria are known to play a critical role in a number of key biological processes, including cellular metabolism. Importantly, irregularities on their working function are nowadays understood to be intimately linked to a range of clinical conditions, highlighting the importance of targeting mitochondria for therapeutic benefits. In this work we carry out an in&#8208;depth evaluation on the progress to date in the field to pave the way for the realization of superior alternatives to those currently existing. The manuscript is structured by commonly used chemical scaffolds and comprehensively covers key aspects factored in design strategies such as synthetic approaches as well as photophysical and biological characterization, to foster collaborative work among organic and physical chemists as well as cell biologists.</dc:description>

         <title>Electro&#8208;assisted Molecular Assembly Endowing the Atomic&#8208;Scaled Catalytic Active Site Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The artificially accurate design of the none&#8208;metal electrocatalyst&#8217;s active site has been a huge challenge since the pure active species with the specific structure could not be strictly controlled by the traditional synthetic methods. The species with the multi configuration in the catalyst hinder the active site identification and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. Here, we developed a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain the pure pentagon ring on the perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed as the topmost sited carbon atom by the subtle passivation process. The reaction mechanism recognition of carbon defect for electrocatalysis is firstly downsized to the single atom scale from the experimental perspective. This innovated electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy is expected to be extensively applied in the active structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of none&#8208;metal electrocatalysts and the verification of the exact active atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Correct identification of the core&#8208;shell structure of cell membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of negatively stained cell membrane (CM)&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) reveal a characteristic core&#8208;shell structure. However, negative staining agents can create artifacts that complicate the determination of the actual NP structure. Herein, we demonstrate with various bare polymeric core NPs, such as poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether&#8208;block&#8208;PLGA, and poly(caprolactone), that certain observed core&#8208;shell structures are actually artifacts caused by the staining process. To address this issue, we use fluorescence quenching to quantify the proportion of fully coated NPs and use statistical TEM analysis to identify and differentiate whether the observed core&#8208;shell structures of CM&#8208;coated PLGA (CM&#8208;PLGA) NPs are due to artifacts or to the CM coating. Integrated shells in TEM images of negatively stained CM&#8208;PLGA NPs are identified as artifacts. The present results challenge current understanding of the structure of CM&#8208;coated polymeric NPs and encourage researchers should use the proposed characterization approach to avoid misinterpretations.</dc:description>

         <title>New Strategy for Optimizing the Properties of Copper Halide Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Lighting&#8208;emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I) halide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials have many advantages, such as diverse structure, facile synthesis, high luminescent efficiency, tunable optical performance, etc., and show a broad application prospect in energy&#8208;saving lighting display and other fields. However, compared with commercial rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based phosphors, the reported hybrids generally suffer from poor stability and low luminescent efficiency, which are the bottleneck problem of their practical application. With the aim of developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported. This strategy can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures by combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to optimizing their properties. This design method is expected to develop high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, promote the in&#8208;depth understanding of this field, and provide new ideas for the optimization of other types of hybrid materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Iodine Capture Behavior by a Censer&#8208;shaped Macrocycle in Vapor Phase and Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine capture is of great significance for disposal of the hazardous radioactive iodine. CTX[P(O)Ph], one kind of censer&#8208;shaped macrocycle cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivatives, was applied as an efficient iodine adsorbent. It showed satisfactory iodine adsorption capacity in vapor phase and could be reused without obvious adsorption capacity loss. Besides, the adsorbent could also uptake iodine in water. Fortunately, two iodine loading CTX[P(O)Ph] crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to explore the mechanism of iodine adsorption. This work provided a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Is  &#8208;PETase has become an enzyme of significant interest due to its ability to catalyse the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. &#8232;We performed hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) at the DSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D3/ma&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP/CHARMM27//rev&#8208;PBE&#8208;D3/dev2&#8208;SVP/CHARMM level to calculate the energy profile for the degradation of a suitable PET model by this enzyme. Very low overall barriers are computed for serine protease&#8208;type hydrolysis steps (as low as 34.1 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ). Spontaneous deprotonation of the final product, terephthalic acid, with a high computed driving force indicates that product release could be rate limiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient photoredox cycles to control perylenediimide self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives has been widely studied for use in photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, photo&#8208;responsive gels, and organic semiconductors. Upon light irradiation, the radical anion (PDI &#8226;&#8211; ) can readily be obtained, whereas further reduction to the dianion (PDI 2&#8211; ) is rare. Here we show that full 2&#8208;electron photoreduction can be achieved using UVC light: 1) in anaerobic conditions by &#8216;direct photoreduction&#8217; of PDI aggregates, or 2) by &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; in aerobic conditions due to acetone ketyl radicals. The latter strategy is also efficient for other dyes, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and methylviologen (MV 2+ ). Efficient photoreduction on the minute time&#8208;scale using simple LED light in aerobic conditions is attractive for use in dissipative light&#8208;driven systems and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted acid vs phase&#8208;transfer catalysis in the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of enesultams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction using unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides using both chiral Bronsted acid or phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under the optimized reaction conditions a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction has also been studied using computational tools observing that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromic Behavior of Dibenzothiepin Derivatives Attached by Two Michler's Hydrol Blue Units</title>

         <dc:description>10,11&#8208;Bis[bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)methylene]dibenzo[  bf  ]thiepin (  1  ) and &#8208;oxepin (  2  ) were prepared as stable yellow crystalline compounds, which are the cyclic analogues of electron&#8208;donating hexaarylbutadienes. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (  1  2+  and  2  2+  ) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for  1  /  1  2+  and  2  /  2  2+  , thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;  S,S  &#8208;dioxide analogue (  3  /  3  2+  ) exhibits quite similar redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin or &#8208;oxepin unit in  1  2+  and  2  2+  , whereas thiepin&#8208;  S  &#8208;oxide derivative (  4  /  4  2+  ) does not exhibit bistability due to the less change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Advance and Designing Strategies in Polymeric Antifungal Agents Inspired by Membrane&#8208;Active Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing prevalence of invasive fungal diseases, the scarcity of existing antifungal drugs, and the continued emergence of antifungal drug resistance urge the development of new antifungal agents. This concept discusses and highlights the advance and designing strategies of antifungal polymeric agents with a focus on design principles inspired by membrane&#8208;active peptides, including host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.







Abstract
The high&#8208;mortality invasive fungal infections seriously threaten the lives of immunocompromised people. Host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are representative membrane&#8208;active peptides with different functions. Among them, host defense peptides mimicking is a valid strategy in the design of synthetic antifungal agents. Despite the brilliance in the field of intracellular delivery, the potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and their mimics for designing antifungal agents has been overlooked. In this concept article, we describe the structural design of synthetic antifungal polymers as mimics of host defense peptides, and highlight the effectiveness and potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;inspired strategy in designing potent and selective antifungal polymeric agents. In addition, an outlook for further expanding the design horizons of antifungal polymers is also presented.

         <title>Dual MOF&#8208;Derived MoS2/CdS Photocatalysts with Rich Sulfur Vacancies for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual MOF&#8208;derived MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with abundant sulfur vacancies was synthesized by in&#8197;situ growth of CdS nanoparticles on 2D MoS2. Because of the existence of both 1T phase and sulfur vacancies, MoS2/CdS not only shows strong charge transport ability, but also possesses prolonged photoelectron lifetime. The 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited 27 times higher hydrogen generation activity than pristine CdS.







Abstract
Cocatalyst plays an important role in efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis. Herein, a MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with MoS2 as cocatalyst was designed by using Mo&#8208;MOF and Cd&#8208;MOF as precursors. Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase, MoS2 shows strong charge capture and transport ability. The photo&#8208;generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bound by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS2 through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large&#8208;scale MoS2. The optimal photocatalyst 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1&#8201;%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt. This work highlights the role of Mo&#8208;MOF derived MoS2 with 1T&#8208;2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS2/CdS composites.

         <title>Electrochemically Determining Electronic Structure of ZnO Quantum Dots with Different Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is employed to determine the band edges and trap states of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. It is demonstrated that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The electronic structure of quantum dots (QDs) including band edges and possible trap states is an important physical property for optoelectronic applications. The reliable determination of the energy levels of QDs remains a big challenge. Herein we employ cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the energy levels of three types of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. Coupled with spectroscopic techniques, it is found that the onset potential of the first reductive wave is likely related to the conduction band edges while the first oxidative wave originates from the trap states. The determined specific energy levels in CV further demonstrates that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies. The present electrochemical method offers a powerful and effective way to determine the energy levels of wide bandgap ZnO QDs, which will boost their device performance.

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) Ionic Liquids with More than One Metal: The Effect of Bromide versus Chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A question of halide: Transition metal&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for electrochemical energy. Bromide&#8208;based ILs are particularly interesting for their high electrochemical stability, although their conductivities are significantly lower than those of their chloride analogues. [MBr4]2&#8722; units are therefore highly promising building blocks for advanced electrochemically active ILs.







Abstract
Fifteen N&#8208;butylpyridinium salts &#8211; five monometallic [C4Py]2[MBr4] and ten bimetallic [C4Py]2[M0.5aM0.5bBr4] (M=Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) &#8211; were synthesized, and their structures and thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All the compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#8201;&#176;C. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction show that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3&#8197;V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10&#8722;5 and 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. The structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs were also compared with those of previous examples using chloride ligands, which illustrated differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A question of halide&lt;/b&gt;: Transition metal-based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for electrochemical energy. Bromide-based ILs are particularly interesting for their high electrochemical stability, although their conductivities are significantly lower than those of their chloride analogues. [MBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units are therefore highly promising building blocks for advanced electrochemically active ILs.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interface Engineering of Conjugated Polymer Based Composites for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis can create a green way to produce clean energy resources, degrade pollutant as well as achieve carbon neutral, making the construction of efficient photocatalysts significant in solving environmental issues. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with adjustable band structures have superior light absorption capacity and flexible morphology that facilitate the contact with other components to form advanced heterojunctions. Interface engineering can strengthen the interfacial contact between the components and further enlarge interfacial contact area, enhance light absorption, accelerate charge transfer and improve the reusability of the composites. In order to throw some new light on heterojunction interface regulation at molecular level, we summarize CP&#8208;based composites with improved photocatalytic performance according to the types of interactions (covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, and other polar interactions) between the components and introduce the corresponding interface building methods, identify techniques. Then the roles of interfaces in different photocatalytic applications are discussed. Finally, we sum up the existing problems in interface engineering of CP&#8208;based composites and look forward to the possible solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling Heparan Sulfate&#8211;Heavy Metal Ions Interaction Using Electrochemical Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The connection between heparan sulfate molecular components and heavy metal ion binding is largely unknown because of the complexity and the heterogeneity of the polysaccharide, which limit the ability to study those interactions. By assembling rationally designed synthetic heparan sulfates on surfaces, we have developed new ways to correlate glycan stereochemistry and sulfate group regiochemistry with heavy metal ion binding and selectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Kikkeri, S. Yitzchaik, M. Hurevich, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202193).

         <title>Bromine Pentafluoride BrF5, the Formation of [BrF6]&#8722; Salts, and the Sterical (In)Activity of the Br Lone Pairs</title>

         <dc:description>BrF  5  can be prepared by the reaction of BrF  3  with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400 nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and the space group corrected to  Pnma  . Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF  5  was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low&#8208;temperature modification in space group  P  2  1  /  c  by single crystal diffraction. BrF  5  reacts with the alkali metal fluorides  A  F (  A  = K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V),  A  [BrF  6  ] whose crystal structures have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF  6  ] structure type (  R [[EQUATION]] , no. 148,  hR  24). For the species [BrF  6  ]  +  , BrF  5  , [BrF  6  ]  &#8722;  and [IF  6  ]  &#8722;  the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of Intrinsic Bond Orbital analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the potential of innovative gold(I) and silver(I) selenourea complexes as anticancer agents targeting TrxR and cellular redox homeostasis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential  in vitro  , on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotides Featuring a Covalently Mercurated 6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Carbazole Residue as High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization Probes for Thiopyrimidine&#8208;Containing Sequences</title>

         <dc:description>Short oligonucleotides incorporating either 1&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbazole, 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbazole or 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbazole C&#8208;nucleoside in the middle of the chain have been synthesized and studied for their potential as hybridization probes for sequences containing thiopyrimidine nucleobases. All of these oligonucleotides formed very stable duplexes with complementary sequences pairing the organometallic moiety with either 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;thiothymine. The isomeric monomercurated oligonucleotides were also able to discriminate between 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymine based on different melting temperatures of the respective duplexes. DFT&#8208;optimized structures of the most stable mononuclear Hg(II)&#8208;mediated base pairs featured a coordinate covalent bond between Hg(II) and either S2 or S4 and a hydrogen bond between the carbazole nitrogen and N3. The dinuclear Hg(II)&#8208;mediated base pairs, in turn, were geometrically very similar to the one previously reported to form between 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbazole and thymine and had one Hg(II) ion coordinated to a thio and the other one to an oxo substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quick and Reproducible Silanization Method by Using Plasma Activation for Hydrophobicity&#8208;Based Kinesin Single Molecule Fluorescence&#8211;Microscopy Assays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strength in weakness: Weakly hydrophobic, plasma&#8208;activated surfaces silanized with a disilazane turned out to be optimal for single&#8208;molecule fluorescence measurements of biological molecular machines. The novel silanization assay reduced the work load more than tenfold and does not require any organic solvents, thus making the assay environmentally friendly and efficient.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule assays often require functionalized surfaces. One approach for microtubule assays renders surfaces hydrophobic and uses amphiphilic blocking agents. However, the optimal hydrophobicity is unclear, protocols take long, produce toxic waste, and are susceptible to failure. Our method uses plasma activation with hydrocarbons for hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) silanization in the gas phase. We measured the surface hydrophobicity, its effect on how well microtubule filaments were bound to the surface, and the number of nonspecific interactions with kinesin motor proteins. Additionally, we tested and discuss the use of different silanes and activation methods. We found that even weakly hydrophobic surfaces were optimal. Our environmentally friendly method significanty reduced the overall preparation effort and resulted in reproducible, high&#8208;quality surfaces with low variability. We expect the method to be applicable to a wide range of other single&#8208;molecule assays.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of the Li anode result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency for LOBs, but they can be resolved by MOF&#8208;based catalysts and separators.

Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered to be the next&#8208;generation energy technology owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of Li anodes result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency. Various materials have been applied to promote the electrochemical performance of LOBs. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porous structures, open active sites and adjustable pore sizes have been attempted as promising materials for catalysts and separators of LOBs. This concept presents an overview of different MOF&#8208;based catalysts for LOBs, including traditional, conductive, semi&#8208;conductive and soluble MOFs, as well as our recently proposed photo&#8208;involved LOBs. Recent advances in MOF&#8208;based separators to restrain the shuttling of redox mediators between cathodes and anodes and suppress the formation of lithium dendrites are also discussed. Finally, perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs for future research are presented.

         <title>Sequential Formation of Heteroternary Cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azaphosphatrane (AZAP) forms a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water and forces CB[10] to adopt an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the cavity. The CB[10] contraction leads to a residual space which favors the co&#8208;inclusion of planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes.







Abstract
The globular and monocationic guest molecule trimethyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane (AZAP, a protonated Verkade superbase) was shown to form a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water. Molecular dynamics calculations showed that CB[10] adopts an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the internal space, CB[10] contracting around AZAP and leaving a significant part of the cavity unoccupied. This residual space was used to co&#8208;include planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes potentially opening new perspectives in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Electrical&#8208;Conductive/Insulating Bi&#8208;Functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries: A strategy of electrical&#8208;conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional layers is proposed to reduce local current density and the difference of Zn metal surface concentration, avoiding direct contact between electrolyte and electrode, and alleviating crazy dendrite growth by coordinating the functions of different coating domains. This strategy is expected to provide a design concept and reference for the realization of dendrite&#8208;free ZIBs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients and high safety. However, dendrite growth and side reactions occur in the Zn anode, which lead to exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and poor cycling stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of a conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anodes. Porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as a conductive layer effectively reduces the nuclear barrier and contains Zn2+ deposition in a certain space. Polyimide (PI) coatings as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn2+, which could reduce the differential concentration on the Zn surface and induce uniform deposition of Zn2+. Therefore, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CE of CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery maintains at 99.2&#8201;% even after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//V2O5 battery exhibits a capacity of nearly 289.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles and no sign of capacity degradation is found, which further demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in practical application.

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supplying Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4  (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8208;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4  matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215; 10&#8208;3  min&#8208;1  . Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0~9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001 &#956;g&#215;L&#8208;1  ), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.</dc:description>

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as ligands for lanthanide cations: Novel structurally characterized Ce(IV) and Ce(III) cyclen&#8208;based complexes and clusters in aqueous solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A delve into the coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds was performed using the DOTA and DOTP ligands (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of highly&#8208;ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual in solution decomposition leads to the accumulation of the in cage complexes of [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in the present study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the abovementioned species, the in cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein as well for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the x&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the herein studied in cage complexes and similar structures published previously, suggests that hard bonding cyclen derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Asymmetric Pyridinium Additions: Mechanistic Insight and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted N&#8208; alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, as controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)&#8208; N &#8208;methylaspidospermidine and (&#8211;)&#8208;paroxetine.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Aromatic Foldamer Helices using Acridine Appendages and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamers helices constitute convenient rigid scaffolds but rarely form ordered arrays upon self&#8208;assembly or in crystals. We show that placing acridine appendages at defined position at the surface of aromatic helices guide their organization in the solid state to form discrete dimers or 1D arrays. Furthermore, metal&#8208;coordination at the acridine units of the same compounds drives self&#8208;assembly in solution.







Abstract
Folded molecules provide complex interaction interfaces amenable to sophisticated self&#8208;assembly motifs. Because of their high conformational stability, aromatic foldamers constitute suitable candidates for the rational elaboration of self&#8208;assembled architectures. Several multiturn helical aromatic oligoamides have been synthesized that possess arrays of acridine appendages pointing in one or two directions. The acridine units were shown to direct self&#8208;assembly in the solid state via aromatic stacking leading to recurrent helix&#8208;helix association patterns under the form of discrete dimers or extended arrays. In the presence of Pd(II), metal coordination of the acridine units overwhelms other forces and generates new metal&#8208;mediated multihelical self&#8208;assemblies, including macrocycles. These observations demonstrate simple access to different types of foldamer&#8208;containing architectures, ranging from discrete objects to 1D and, by extension, 2D and 3D arrays.

         <title>Directed Palladium Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented construction of a C(sp2)&#8208;SCF2CO2Et bond was successfully achieved by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. This robust protocol allowed the functionalization of a broad panel of aromatic and olefinic derivatives (37&#8197;examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield), a real advance as existing routes were restricted to the SCF3 and SCF2H residues. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions further illustrated the synthetic value of this fluorinated motif.







Abstract
The unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation reaction of various unsaturated derivatives was studied. In the presence of the (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylsulfenamide reagent I and under mild reaction conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C), both 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl and 2&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;vinyl)pyridine derivatives were smoothly functionalized with this methodology (37 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Moreover, the synthetic interest of this fluorinated moiety was further showcased by its conversion into various original fluorinated residues. Finally, a plausible mechanism for this transformation was suggested.

         <title>Enantioselective Approach for Expanding the Three&#8208;Dimensional Space of Tetrahydroquinoline to Develop BET Bromodomain Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. Assembling simple functional groups by proline organocatalysis coupled with the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 in the same flask allows for the mild formation of aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide species that undergo nucleophilic addition to give access to enantio&#8208;enriched tri&#8208;substituted tetrahydroquinolines with a novel configuration. This advanced three&#8208;dimensional structure, after only two additional steps, gave rise to a valuable enantiopure and selective anti&#8208;inflammatory compound.







Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, which generates a highly electrophilic aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one&#8208;pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a cis&#8208;2,3 and trans&#8208;3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three&#8208;step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2&#8208;selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti&#8208;inflammatory effect.

         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high&#8208;resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labelled phospholipids, we show that we can selectivity detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8208;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert &#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho &#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8208;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser base we are reporting herein.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Unprotected C&#8208;Acyl Manno&#8208;, Rhamno&#8208; and Lyxopyranosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis  C  &#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for  C  &#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected  C&#8208;  acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the  C  &#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8209;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of  C  &#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;  d  &#8208;manno&#8208;,  l  &#8208;rhamno&#8208; and  d  &#8208;lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies.

Syntheses for  C  -acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected  C-  acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the  C  -acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8209;selective four-step one-pot method for the synthesis of  C  -acyl &#945;-  d  -manno-,  l  -rhamno- and  d  -lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies. Furthermore, the  C  -acyl &#945;-glycosides were easily isomerized to give rapid access to their &#946;-anomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective Coupling of &#960;&#8208;Systems to Access Metallated 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;Skipped Dienes in Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8211;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8211;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.g., [Si]&#8211;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, we attempted to include all precedents, including our recent studies. The present Concept article may be extremely useful for researchers working in this area as it provides a strong conceptual framework.</dc:description>

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960;&#160;Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i) selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii) effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32 interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.</dc:description>
