         <title>New Opportunities for Utilization of the Sulfoximine Group in Medicinal Chemistry from the Drug Designer&#8217;s Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70 years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This minireview highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;phosphine catalyzed reactions relies largely on accessing ever more precisely tuned phosphine ligands via  de novo  synthesis. Late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization and diversification of commercial phosphines offers rapid access to entire libraries of derivatives based on privileged scaffolds. But existing routes, relying on phosphorous&#8208;directed transformations, only yield functionalization of C  sp  2&#8211;H bonds in a specific position relative to phosphorous. In contrast to phosphorous&#8208;directed strategies, herein we disclose an orthogonal functionalization strategy capable of introducing a range of substituents into previously inaccessible positions on arylphosphines. The strongly coordinating phosphine group acts solely as a bystander in the sterically controlled borylation of bulky phosphines, and the resulting borylated phosphines serve as the supporting ligand for palladium during diversification via phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) ionic liquids with more than one metal: the effect of bromide vs. chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fifteen  N  &#8208;butylpyridinium salts, including five monometallic [C  4  Py]  2  [MBr  4  ] and ten bimetallic [C  4  Py]  2  [M  0.5  a  M  0.5  b  Br  4  ] (M = Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn), were synthesized. Their structure and their thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#176;C. Powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3 V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10  &#8208;4  and 10  &#8208;8  S cm  &#8208;1  . At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10  &#8208;2  S cm  &#8208;1  at 70&#176;C. The article also compares the structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs with previous examples using chloride ligands and illustrates differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Cocatalysts for Enhancing Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Performance of BiVO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction is usually limited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron transfer processes of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO  4  ) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO  4  for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO  4  . Six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  PBAs@BiVO  4  photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO  4  alone. Among them, the Co&#8208;Co PBA@BiVO  4  photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO  4  coupling with Co&#8208;Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO  4  , facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO  4  and Co&#8208;Co PBA as well as surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO  4  . Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Enzymatic Features in a Supramolecular Iridium Catalyst by Computational Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;biological catalysts following the governing principles of enzymes are attractive systems to disclose unprecedented reactivities. Most of those existing catalysts feature an adaptable molecular recognition site for substrate binding that are prone to undergo conformational selection pathways. Herein, we present a non&#8208;biological catalyst able to bind substrates via the induced fit model according to in&#8208;depth computational calculations. The system, which is constituted by an inflexible substrate&#8208;recognition site derived from a zinc&#8208;porphyrin in the second coordination sphere, features destabilization of ground states as well as stabilization of transition states for the relevant iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond borylation of pyridine. In addition, this catalyst appears to be most suited to tightly bind the transition state rather than the substrate. Besides these features, which are reminiscent from the action mode of enzymes, new elementary catalytic steps have been disclosed owing to the unique distortions encountered in the different intermediates and transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelasticity&#160;in Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ferroelastics have received particular attention for potential applications in mechanical switches, shape memory, energy conversion, information processing, and solar cells, by taking advantages of their low&#8208;cost, light&#8208;weight, easy preparation, and mechanical flexibility. The unique structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be a design platform for symmetry breaking&#8208;associated order&#8208;disorder in lattice, thereby possessing great potential for ferroelastic phase transition. Herein, we review the research progress of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics in recent years, focusing on the crystal structures, dimensions, phase transitions and ferroelastic properties. In view of the few reports on molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastics, we look forward to the structural design strategies of molecular ferroelastic materials, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastic materials in the future. This review will have positive guiding significance for the synthesis and future exploration of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid molecular ferroelastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry of pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and related analogs: from synthesis to applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF  5  )&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8211;F, and C&#8211;SF  5  bond formation as well as the use of SF  5  &#8208;containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway&#8208;to&#8208;heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise&#8208;inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago. Herein, we report and evaluate the properties of the SF  5  group and analogs, by summarizing synthetic methodologies available to access them as well as following applications in material science and medicinal chemistry since 2015.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended&#160;0&#8208;, 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, and 3&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>

         <dc:description>Layered (2&#8208;D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated via atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer scale, magnetically ordered layers separated via a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and their applications and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0&#8208;D) as well as extended chain (1&#8208;D) and 3&#8208;D extended network structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unified Approach to Diverse Fused Fragments via Catalytic Dehydrative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to diverse polycyclic scaffolds via an efficient calcium catalyzed dehydration&#8208;cyclization strategy is described. This approach provides a range of small molecule fragments bearing a range of medicinally relevant functional groups. Both Lewis and Bronsted acid pathways are in use, with the ability to fine tune the reactivity depending on the choice of solvent.







Abstract
A range of highly functionalized polycyclic fragments have been synthesized, employing a catalytic dehydrative cyclization. A range of nucleophiles are shown to be successful, with the reaction producing numerous high value motifs.

         <title>Synergistic Strategies in Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Come together: Asymmetric aminocatalysis plays a pivotal role on the development in stereoselective transformations, synergistically combined with organo&#8208;, metal, photoredox and electrocatalysis. In this scenario, the HOMO&#8208;raising and LUMO&#8208;lowering activation of carbonyl compounds open new gateways to complex architectures and new sustainable reactivities. Last but not least, this research area will keep driving the development of the whole organocatalysis, toward its synergistic combination with other activation strategies.







Abstract
Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activation of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds through HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by a deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of this review is to cover recent developments in synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.

         <dc:description>
An entirely new displacement system based on anomeric DNA without toehold was designed and its applicability was demonstrated. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. During displacement strand orientation changed from antiparallel in &#946;&#8208;D DNA to parallel in &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D DNA and back to antiparallel in &#945;/&#945;&#8208;D DNA. Reaction progress was visualized by fluorescence change using the intercalator ethidium bromide as sensor.







Abstract
DNA strand displacement is a technique to exchange one strand of a double stranded DNA by another strand (invader). It is an isothermal, enzyme free method driven by single stranded overhangs (toeholds) and is employed in DNA amplification, mismatch detection and nanotechnology. We discovered that anomeric (&#945;/&#946;) DNA can be used for heterochiral strand displacement. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. Single stranded &#945;&#8208;D DNA acts as invader. Herein, new anomeric displacement systems with and without toeholds were designed. Due to their resistance against enzymatic degradation, the systems are applicable to living cells. The light&#8208;up intercalator ethidium bromide is used as fluorescence sensor to follow the progress of displacement. Anomeric DNA displacement shows benefits over canonical DNA in view of toehold free displacement and simple detection by ethidium bromide.

         <title>Progress in Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on convergent paired electrolysis has been summarized in this concept article. Four strategies based upon metal catalysis, persistent radical effects, microfluidic chemistry, and alternating current electrolysis are discussed in relation to their underlying mechanisms.







Abstract
Convergent paired electrolysis combines both anodic and cathodic reactions simultaneously in an electrochemical transformation. It provides a highly energy&#8208;efficient and divergent approach to conventionally challenging and useful structures. However, the physical separation of the two half&#8208;electrode reactions makes it extremely difficult to couple the intermediates arising from the two electrodes. In this concept article, four strategies used in convergent paired electrolysis will be discussed from the perspective of the reaction mechanism: a) metal&#8208;catalyzed convergent paired electrolysis, b) convergent paired electrolysis enabled by persistent radical effects, c) microfluidic chemistry applied to convergent paired electrolysis, and d) alternating current electrolysis.

It provides a highly energy-efficient and divergent approach to conventionally challenging and useful structures. However, the physical separation of the two half-electrode reactions makes it extremely difficult to couple the intermediates arising from the two electrodes. In this concept article, four strategies used in convergent paired electrolysis will be discussed from the perspective of the reaction mechanism: a) metal-catalyzed convergent paired electrolysis, b) convergent paired electrolysis enabled by persistent radical effects, c) microfluidic chemistry applied to convergent paired electrolysis, and d) alternating current electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Autotuning of Vibrational Strong Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actuatable Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavities allow site&#8208;selective organic reaction under vibrational strong coupling. The piezoelectric actuators with a computer&#8208;controlled feedback loop are installed in the FP cavity, which enables accurate retuning of the cavity mode in response to refractive index changes within the cavity. Thanks to the autotuning of cavity mode, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved, despite the respective reactive carbonyl stretches being energetically close.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemistry opens new paths for the synthesis of technologically important molecules. When a reactant is placed inside a Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavity, energy exchange between molecular vibrations and resonant cavity photons results in vibrational strong coupling (VSC). VSC has recently been implicated in modified chemical reactivity at specific reactive sites. However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50&#8201;% improvement in site&#8208;selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.

         <title>Chemically Laminated 2D Bis(terpyridine)metal Polymer Films: Formation Mechanism at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface and Redox Rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox rectifiers: Heterolaminated 2D coordination polymer films were synthesized at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface, and the mechanism of film growth was revealed. The bilayer films show unique redox behavior based on the electron transfer mediation in an electrolyte solution and stable rectification characteristics when the film is sandwiched by electrodes in a dry state.







Abstract
Recent studies on molecular 2D materials with high tunability of structure and function have focused mostly on the discovery of new precursors. Here, we demonstrate a facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of laminated 2D coordination polymer films comprising bis(terpyridine)iron and cobalt at a water/dichloromethane interface. Cross&#8208;sectional elemental mapping unveiled the stratum&#8208;like structure of the film and revealed that the second layer grows to the dichloromethane side below the first layer. Cyclic voltammetry clarified that the bottom layer mediates charge transfer between the top layer and the substrate in a narrow potential region of mixed&#8208;valence states. Furthermore, the bilayer film sandwiched by electrodes in a dry condition shows stable rectification character, and the barrier voltage corresponds to the redox potential difference between the two layers. This study introduces a new strategy for polymer design to explore the materials science of molecular 2D materials.

         <title>Recyclable Mn(I) Catalysts for Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Mechanistic, DFT and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic and DFT studies on a series of recyclable Mn(I) complexes disclosed six vital factors determining their activities along with the existence of different mechanisms for asymmetric direct and transfer hydrogenations. Moreover, Mn(I) complex 2&#8201;b (cat. loading: 0.4&#8208;1&#8197;mol%) performs base&#8208;free transfer hydrogenation of alkyl ketones ketones with enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process has been discovered for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover.







Abstract
We report here a mechanistic, DFT and catalytic study on a series of Mn(I) complexes 1, 2(a&#8211;d), 3, 4. The studies apprehended the requirements for Mn(I) complexes to be active in both asymmetric direct (AH) and transfer hydrogenations (ATH). The investigations disclosed 6 vital factors accelerating the formation of a resting species, which plays a significant role in lowering the activities of the Mn(I) complex 1 in ATH and AH, respectively. In addition, we also report here a base free Mn(I) catalyzed ATH of aryl alkyl ketones with high enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and improved activity. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover has been discovered. Notably, the studies provide evidence for the existence of two different temperature dependent mechanisms for AH and ATH, in contrast to previous studies on related systems.

         <title>Positive Cooperativity Induced by Interstrand Interactions in Silver(I) Complexes with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;Diimine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of its large size and its optimized covalency toward heterocyclic N&#8208;donor atoms, the intermediate [AgIL]+ unit (depicted as a paraglider) is eager to catch a second &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diimine ligands coming down from the summit of positive allosteric cooperativity. The final stable [AgIL2]+ complex reaches the Valley of Stability. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Zare, C. Piguet, E.&#8197;C. Constable et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200912).

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich EDOT Linkers in Tetracationic bis&#8208;Triarylborane Chromophores: Influence on Water Stability, Biomacromolecule Sensing, and Photoinduced Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with EDOT linkers, show red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;linked analogues, with one derivative emitting in the NIR. A water&#8208;stable EDOT&#8208;linked tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue efficiently photo&#8208;induce 1O2 production. Both bind to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under visible light irradiation, exhibit rapid, strong cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
Three novel tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers, and their neutral precursors, showed significant red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;containing analogues, with one of the EDOT&#8208;derivatives emitting in the NIR region. Only the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation was stable in aqueous solution, indicating that direct attachment of a thiophene or even 3&#8208;methylthiophene to the boron atom is insufficient to provide hydrolytic stability in aqueous solution. Further comparative analysis of the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue revealed efficient photo&#8208;induced singlet oxygen production, with the consequent biological implications. Thus, both analogues bind strongly to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, very efficiently enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under intense visible light irradiation, they exhibit almost instantaneous and very strong cytotoxic effects, presumably attributed to singlet oxygen production. Thus, both compounds are intriguing theranostic agents, whose intracellular and probably intra&#8208;tissue location can be monitored by strong fluorescence, allowing switching on of the strong bioactivity by well&#8208;focused visible light.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Proteins via a Bio&#8208;Inspired Copper(II)&#8208;Mediated Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Pydinecarboxaldehyde derivatives undergoes unique aldol reaction at the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins in the presence of a copper(II) salt under mild conditions. Peptides and proteins are readily modified with useful functional groups or reactive handles in a single step.







Abstract
The chemical modification of proteins is an effective technique for manipulating the properties and functions of proteins, and for creating protein&#8208;based materials. The N&#8208;terminus is a promising target for single&#8208;site modification that provides modified proteins with uniform structures and properties. In this paper, a copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction with 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PC) derivatives is proposed as an operationally simple method to selectively modify the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins at room temperature and physiological pH. The copper(II) ion activates the N&#8208;terminal amino acids by complexation with an imine of the N&#8208;terminal amino acid and 2&#8208;PCs, realizing the selective formation of the nucleophilic intermediate at the N&#8208;terminus. This results in a stable carbon&#8208;carbon bond between the 2&#8208;PCs and the &#945;&#8208;carbon of various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. The reaction is applied to four different proteins, including biopharmaceuticals such as filgrastim and trastuzumab. The modified trastuzumab retains the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 recognition activity.

         <title>A Route to Lipid ALC&#8208;0315: a Key Component of a COVID&#8208;19 mRNA Vaccine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ALC&#8208;0315 is a key component of the Pfizer&#8208;BioNTech COVID&#8208;19 vaccine and a highly sought&#8208;after lipid for nucleic acid therapeutics research. This paper, a study in reductive amination, describes a synthetic route that more than doubles the overall yield relative to the published one. Key aspects of the work include the use of (i) a protected form of a poorly organic&#8208;soluble aminoalcohol, (ii) a TEMPO/bleach oxidation to produce crucial aldehydes, and (iii) a more organic&#8208;soluble triacyloxyborohydride reagent.







Abstract
This paper describes a synthesis of ALC&#8208;0315 by a sequence that more than doubles the overall yield relative to the published one, and that employs much cleaner reactions, thereby facilitating purifications to a considerable extent

         <title>The Importance of Mg2+&#8208;free State in Nucleotide Exchange of Oncogenic K&#8208;Ras Mutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For efficient targeting of oncogenic K&#8208;Ras interaction sites, a mechanistic picture of the Ras&#8208;cycle is necessary. Herein, we used NMR relaxation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the role of slow dynamics in wild&#8208;type and three oncogenic P&#8208;loop mutants of K&#8208;Ras. Our measurements reveal a dominant two&#8208;state conformational exchange on the ms timescale in both GDP&#8208; and GTP&#8208;bound K&#8208;Ras. The identified low&#8208;populated higher energy state in GDP&#8208;loaded K&#8208;Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide&#8208;bound/Mg  2+  &#8208;free state characterized by shortened &#946;2/&#946;3&#8208;strands and a partially released switch&#8208;I region preparing K&#8208;Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation&#8208;specific differences in K&#8208;Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our understanding of prolonged K&#8208;Ras signaling and may aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K&#8208;Ras.</dc:description>

         <title>Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission from an AB&#8208;Type Monomer</title>

         <dc:description>
Luminescent polymers are generally molecularly designed by polymerization of luminescent moieties, in which the polymerization method exbibits limited effect on luminescent properties. In addition, the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Here, a &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for the molecular design of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer via Barbier polymerization, resulting in a series of nonconjugated luminescent polymers through polymerization&#8208;induced emission.







Abstract
Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending the &#960; system of the polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into the polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi&#8208;step procedures. Meanwhile, according to the step&#8208;growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from an AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) from an AB&#8208;type monomer. The key step in the realization of the hyperbranched polymer is bi&#8208;functionalization of a mono&#8208;functional group. Through a Barbier reaction between an organohalide and an ester group in one pot, bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional ester is realized through two&#8208;step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through&#8208;space conjugation and inter&#8208; and intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effects induced by polymer chain, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation&#8208;induced emission type PIEgen. Whereas, it is aggregation&#8208;caused quenching type PIEgen if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen are in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting systems. This work, therefore, expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymers through &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one&#8208;pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.

&lt;p&gt;Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending the &#960; system of the polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into the polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi-step procedures.

Herein, we report a one-pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization-induced emission (PIE) from an AB-type monomer. The key step in the realization of the hyperbranched polymer is bi-functionalization of a mono-functional group. Through a Barbier reaction between an organohalide and an ester group in one pot, bi-functionalization of mono-functional ester is realized through two-step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through-space conjugation and inter- and intramolecular charge-transfer effects induced by polymer chain, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation-induced emission type PIEgen. Whereas, it is aggregation-caused quenching type PIEgen if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen are in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting systems. This work, therefore, expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymers through &#8220;bi-functionalization of mono-functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one-pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. We now report a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba&#8208;dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the anion&#8211;radical state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at &#955;max&#8764;1300&#8197;nm and can be either oxidized to a regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M = Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Thomas, J. van&#8197;Lierop, V.&#8197;N. Nemykin, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201181).

         <title>A Formylglycine&#8208;Peptide for the Site&#8208;Directed Identification of Phosphotyrosine&#8208;Mimetic Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of protein&#8208;binding fragments for precisely defined binding sites is an unmet challenge so far. Here, we investigate formylglycine as a molecular probe for the sensitive detection of fragments binding to a spatially defined protein site. Formylglycine peptide&#160;  3&#160;  was derived from a phosphotyrosine&#8208;containing peptide substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by replacing the phosphorylated amino acid with the reactive electrophile. Fragment ligation with formylglycine occurred in&#8208;situ in aqueous physiological buffer. Structures and kinetics were validated by NMR spectroscopy. Screening and hit validation revealed fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated hit fragments being able to replace the native phosphotyrosine residue. The formylglycine probe identified low&#8208;affinity fragments with high spatial resolution as substantiated by molecular modelling. The best fragment hit, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl&#8208;acetic acid, was converted into a cellularly active, nanomolar inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized pseudo&#8208;  meta  [2.2]para&#173;cyclo&#173;phanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure literature known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, we show that the pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches an astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, we show that the chiral pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs induce remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307 L mol  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Reverse Replacement in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 with 1,4&#8208;Dicarboxybenzene for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by the ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times enhancement of the hydrogen production rate than the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This work broadens the pathway of the ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

In this work, a solvent-assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH  2  -MIL-125 (Ti) by 1,4-dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times enhancement of the hydrogen production rate than the pristine material under visible-light irradiation. This work broadens the pathway of the ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissecting non&#8208;covalent interactions in carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids exhibiting double and single hydrogens bonds between ions of like charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid 1&#8722;(carboxymethyl)pyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [HOOC&#8722;CH  2  &#8722;py][NTf  2  ] exhibits three types of hydrogen bonding: The expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and surprisingly single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows analyzing and characterizing all types of hydrogen bonding present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid. We find doubly hydrogen bonded cationic dimers (c  +  =c  +  ) in the crystalline phase. With increasing temperature, this binding motif opens in the liquid and is replaced by (c  +  &#8722;c  +  &#8722;a  &#8722;  ) species, with a remaining single cationic hydrogen bond and an additional hydrogen bond between cation and anion. We provide clear evidence that the IL evaporates as hydrogen bonded ion pairs (c  +  &#8722;a  &#8722;  ) into the gas phase. The measured transition enthalpies allow to dissect the non&#8208;covalent interactions and to determine the hydrogen bond strength between ions of like charge.</dc:description>

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the fact that hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx  nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composite has a high HER performance with 114 &#956;mol/h/gcat  , which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx  and Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Conversion of an Unstable Imine Cage to a Stable Cage with Amide Moieties towards Selective Receptor for Fluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of robust covalent macrocycles/cages via multiple amide&#8208;bond forming reaction is highly challenging and generally it needs multistep reactions. One&#8208;pot reaction of appropriate di&#8208;/tri&#8208;acyl chloride with a diamine generally results polymers or oligomers instead of discrete architectures. To overcome this limitation, a strategy is reported here using dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction of imine&#8208;based macrocycle and cage upon treatment of a diamine with di&#8208; and tri&#8208;aldehydes respectively, followed by post&#8208;synthesis one&#8208;step conversion of imine bonds to amides to form the desired robust macrocycle and cage containing multiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found to form aggregates in DMSO, the cage was intact without any aggregation. Six amide groups in the confined pocket of the cage made it an ideal receptor for selective binding of fluoride with very high selectivity (~3 103 fold) over chloride, and it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and other oxyanions.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed laser excited photoacoustic effect is increasingly employed for the diagnosis and treatment of diverse diseases. Pulsed laser irradiation is observed to generate reactive species by photosensitization&#8208;free nanocapsules, which potentially broadens the scope of general photosensitizers via facile light mode switching from continuous to pulsed one. In this Concept article, the research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics is summarized to inspire novel methodologies and extra photoacoustic and photodynamic materials.







Abstract
Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.

In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Emitting Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyad: Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopic Studies</title>

The locally&#8208;excited triplet state (3LE) is found as an essential intermediate state in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of compact electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor system. 3LE and charge&#8208;separated states (1CS and 3CS) are close to each other in energy, the interaction of three states causes TADF, which is analyzed by femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
We prepared an orthogonal compact electron&#8208;donor (phenoxazine, PXZ)&#8208;acceptor (naphthalimide, NI) dyad (NI&#8208;PXZ), to study the photophysics of the thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has a luminescence lifetime of 16.4&#8197;ns (99.2&#8201;%)/17.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.80&#8201;%). A weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed for the dyad, indicating non&#8208;negligible electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor at the ground state. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows a fast charge separation (CS) (ca. 2.02&#8764;2.72&#8197;ps), the majority of the singlet CS state is short&#8208;lived, especially in polar solvents (&#964;CR = 10.3&#8197;ps in acetonitrile, vs. 1.83&#8197;ns in toluene, 7.81&#8197;ns in n&#8208;hexane). Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detects a long&#8208;lived transient species in n&#8208;hexane, which is with a mixed triplet local excited state (3LE) and charge separated state (3CS), the lifetime is 15.4&#8197;&#956;s. In polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, a neat 3CS state was observed, whose lifetimes are 226&#8197;ns and 142&#8197;ns, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate the existence of strongly spin exchanged 3LE/3CT states, with the effective zero field splitting (ZFS) |D| and |E| parameters of 1484&#8197;MHz and 109&#8197;MHz, respectively, much smaller than that of the native 3NI state (2475 and 135&#8197;MHz). It is rare but solid experimental evidence that a closely&#8208;lying 3LE state is crucial for occurrence of TADF and this 3LE state is an essential intermediate state to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing in TADF systems.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Talks Between Sulfane Sulfur and Thiol at a Zinc(II) Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tripodal [ZnII] complex has been demonstrated to assist cross&#8208;talks between sulfane sulfur and thiol under ambient base&#8208;free conditions, thereby revealing new possible roles of [ZnII] coordination motifs in thiol persulfidation, polysulfide formation, and its cross&#8208;over with free thiol relevant to sulfur biochemistry.







Abstract
Transformations of sulfane sulfur compounds (e.&#8201;g. organic polysulfides (R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R, n&gt;2) and elemental sulfur (S8)) play pivotal roles in the biochemical landscape of sulfur, and thus supports signaling activities of H2S. Although a number of previous reports illustrate amine mediated reactions of S8 and thiol (RSH) yielding R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R, this report illustrates that a tripodal [ZnII] complex [(Bn3Tren)ZnII&#8722;OH2](ClO4)2 (1) facilitates the reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol (RSH), thereby offering an amine&#8208;free biologically relevant complementary route. UV&#8208;vis monitoring of the reactions and a set of control experiments underline the definitive role of [ZnII] coordination motif in the reactions of sulfane sulfur (e.&#8201;g. S8 and R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R) with RSH. Detailed investigations (UV&#8208;vis, NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, intermediate trapping, and TEMPO radical interference experiments) disclose the key differences in the [ZnII] versus previously known amine mediated routes. Moreover, the persulfide (RSS&#8722;) trapping experiments using 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (F&#8208;DNB) reveal the intermediacy of RSS&#8722; species in the [ZnII] mediated reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol, thereby demonstrating [ZnII] assisted persulfidation of thiol in the presence of sulfane sulfur species. Of broader impact, this study underscores the feasible influence of biologically relevant [ZnII] coordination motifs (e.&#8201;g. carbonic anhydrase) on the sulfane sulfur chemistry in biology.

         <title>Chiral Fibers Formation Upon Assembly of Tetraphenylalanine Peptide Conjugated to a PNA Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer &#8220;at&#8221; self&#8208;assembles to produce helical fibers. Interactions between both components of the conjugate, either the peptide and the nucleobases, trigger self&#8208;assembly. Antiparallel beta sheets between the peptides are zipped by hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases. Spectroscopic measurements, microscopy data along with a computational model support this hypothesis. On the contrary, when &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by &#8220;gc&#8221; PNA, odd shaped spheroid are obtained.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules such as peptides, nucleic acids or their analogues affords supramolecular objects, exhibiting structures and physical properties dependent on the amino&#8208;acid or nucleobase composition. Conjugation of the peptide diphenylalanine (FF) to peptide nucleic acids triggers formation of self&#8208;assembled structures, mainly stabilized by interactions between FF. In this work we report formation of homogeneous chiral fibers upon self&#8208;assembly of the hybrid composed of the tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer adenine&#8208;thymine (at). In this case nucleobases seem to play a key role in determining the morphology and chirality of the fibers. When the PNA &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by guanine&#8208;cytosine dimer &#8220;gc&#8221;, disordered structures are observed. Spectroscopic characterization of the self&#8208;assembled hybrids, along with AFM and SEM studies is reported. Finally, a structural model consistent with the experimental evidence has also been obtained, showing how the building blocks of 4Fat arrange to give helical fibers.

         <title>A Series of Rare&#8208;Earth Mesoionic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generality of employing N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins in the synthesis of mesoionic carbene (MIC) complexes has been shown here with the advent of twelve new f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth metal MIC complexes, expanding the library of f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth MIC complexes from four to now sixteen in total. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterisation data suggest the presence of a solely &#963;&#8208;component to the M&#8722;Ccarbene bonding interaction, whilst magnetic studies highlight that two of the MIC complexes are field&#8208;induced single&#8201;molecule magnets (SMMs).

We report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of rare&#8208;earth mesoionic carbene complexes, [RE{N(SiMe3)2}3{CN(Me)C(Me)N(Me)CH}] (3RE, RE=Sc, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), greatly expanding the limited library of f&#8208;block mesoionic carbene complexes. These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a &#963;&#8208;component to the metal&#8722;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f3 metal engages in a weak &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterised by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that 3Dy and 3Er are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with Ueff energy barriers of 35 and 128&#8197;K, respectively. Complex 3Dy is, as expected, a poorly performing SMM, but conversely 3Er performs unexpectedly well.

Unprecedented NIR CPL activity in water from a hydrophobic chiral Yb(III) complex embedded in PLGA nanoparticles was observed







Abstract
We report the first example of very efficient NIR Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) (around 970&#8197;nm) in water, obtained thanks to the combined use of a chiral Yb complex and of poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. [YbL(tta)2]CH3COO (L=N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;(R,R+S,S) cyclohexanediamine and tta=2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate) shows good CPL in organic solvents, because the tta ligands efficiently sensitize Yb NIR luminescence and the readily prepared chiral ligand L endows the complex with the necessary dissymmetry. PLGA nanoparticles incorporate the complex and protect the metal ion from the intrusion of solvent molecules, while ensuring biocompatibility, water solubility and stability to the complex. Hydrophilic NIR&#8208;CPL optical probes can find applications in the field of NIR&#8208;CPL bio&#8208;assays.

Indole multi&#8208;site editing!! Unprecedented indole multi&#8208;site editing was accomplished by a unique ring&#8208;switch reaction of hemiaminals.







Abstract
This work reports the novel reactivity of hemiaminal as a precursor for indole editing at the multi&#8208;site. The HFIP&#8208;promoted indole editing of indoline hemiaminals affords 2&#8208;arylindoles through a ring&#8208;switch sequence. The key to success of this transformation is to use a cyclic hemiaminal as an &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde surrogate under transient tautomeric control. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and good yields with broad functional group tolerance. The utility of this transformation is presented through the one&#8208;pot protocol and the synthesis of isocryptolepine.

Micro&#8208;flow technology enables a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols including ones that contain acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities, and various asymmetric phosphotriesters were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields (53&#8211;83&#8201;%). Mechanistic study suggested that Berry pseudorotation was a rate&#8208;limiting step in the nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohol.







Abstract
We demonstrate a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. A over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed by the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculations of the sequential nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols were performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein, we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the absence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.

The direct incorporation of a carborane moiety into tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides is presented as a sustainable method to access novel potential anti&#8208;cancer and BNCT agents via non&#8208;toxic manganese(I) catalysis.







Abstract
A robust method for the selective labeling of peptides via manganese(I) catalysis was devised to achieve the C&#8208;2 alkenylation of tryptophan containing peptides with 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes. The manganese&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was accomplished with high catalytic efficiency, and featured low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and excellent E&#8208;stereoselectivity. This approach unravels a promising tool for the assembly of o&#8208;carborane with structurally complex peptides of relevance to applications in boron neutron capture therapy.

         <title>Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons</title>

Getting a handle on diversification: Aryl nitriles have been used to support hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly in the solid state to achieve an intermolecular photodimerization. The resulting tetrafunctionalized cyclobutane is amenable to rapid diversification as demonstrated by a post&#8208;click modification. The integration of aryl nitriles as supramolecular handles allows the self&#8208;assembly process to be programmed for post&#8208;modification and conversion of the product to a wide variety of molecules.







Abstract
A method to rapidly diversify the molecules formed in organic crystals is introduced, with aryl nitriles playing a novel dual role as both hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors and modifiable organic groups. The discovery of coexisting supramolecular synthons in the same crystal is also described. The general concept is demonstrated by using a bis(aryl nitrile) alkene that undergoes a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization to form a tetra(aryl nitrile)cyclobutane. The product is readily converted by click reactivity to a tetra(aryl tetrazole) and by hydrolysis to a tetra(aryl carboxylic acid). The integration of aryl nitriles into solid&#8208;state reactions opens broad avenues to post&#8208;modify products formed in crystalline solids for rapid diversification.

2D Zr&#8208;MOF gets sulfonated: By using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first sulfonated zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is synthesized. The highly stable porous platform is proton conductive under humidified and anhydrous conditions. The 2D nature of the material offers possibilities for modification of its composition, morphology and function towards a variety of energy and environmental applications.







Abstract
By using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first sulfonated zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (JUK&#8208;14) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, was synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the material is built of Zr6O4(OH)4(COO)8 oxoclusters, doubly 4&#8208;connected by angular dicarboxylates, and stacked in layers spaced 1.5&#8197;nm apart by the presence of sulfonic groups. JUK&#8208;14 exhibits excellent hydrothermal stability, permanent porosity confirmed by gas adsorption studies, and shows high (&gt;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm) and low (&lt;10&#8722;8&#8197;S/cm) proton conductivity under humidified and anhydrous conditions, respectively. Post&#8208;synthesis inclusion of imidazole improves the overall conductivity increasing it to 1.7&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity, and by 3 orders of magnitude at 160&#8201;&#176;C. The combination of 2D porous nature with robustness of zirconium MOFs offers new opportunities for exploration of the material towards energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Formate in Methanol Solutions by Mn&#8208;Functionalized Electrodes in the Presence of Amines

Carbon cloth electrodes were modified by attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst to the surface by covalent bonds. The system has been used for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in presence of amines in methanol solution. The enhanced CO2 solubility and the use of pentamethyldiethylentriamine (PMDETA) induce change in chemical selectivity from CO to formate, with very high performances and high selectivity.







Abstract
Carbon cloth electrode modified by covalently attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst is used as cathode for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in methanol solutions. Six different industrial amines are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in millimolar concentrations to deliver a series of new reactive system. While such absorbents were so far believed to provide a CO2 reservoir and act as sacrificial proton source, we herein demonstrate that this role can be played by methanol, and that the adduct formed between CO2 and the amine can act as an effector or inhibitor toward the catalyst, thereby enhancing or reducing the production of formate. Pentamethyldiethylentriamine (PMDETA), identified as the best effector in our series, converts CO2 in wet methanolic solution into bisammonium bicarbonate. Computational studies revealed that this adduct is responsible for a barrierless transformation of CO2 to formate by the reduced form of the Mn catalyst covalently bonded to the electrode surface. As a consequence, selectivity can be switched on demand from CO to formate anion, and in the case of (PMDETA) an impressive TONHCOO&#8722; of 2.8&#215;104 can be reached. This new valuable knowledge on an integrated capture and utilization system paves the way toward more efficient transformation of CO2 into liquid fuel.

         <title>Significant Effect of the Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on the Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with a Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>

The uses of wobbly bridges: The effect of the flexibility of the bridging alkyl chains in a fourfold rotaxane heterodimer of porphyrin and phthalocyanine on the face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance between the two porphyrinoids has been examined. It was found that longer alkyl bridges with higher flexibility resulted in closer stacking of the two porphyrinoids, whereas shorter bridges hindered stacking because of their lower flexibility.







Abstract
Spatial distance is an important factor in controlling the functional interactions between molecular units in a conjugate; therefore, the bridging unit has been closely examined. Here, we examined the effect of the flexibility of bridging alkyl chains on the proximity of stacked porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated with a fourfold rotaxane linkage. We found that closely stacking two &#960; systems requires bridging alkyl chains above a certain length, and the shorter bridges hinder stacking because of their lower flexibility. The stacking distance between porphyrin and phthalocyanine in the conjugate with decyl (C10) chains was estimated to be 4.03&#8197;&#197; and showed a unique physical character arising from short&#8208;distance interactions. The longer alkyl chains minimized steric restriction inside the fourfold rotaxane and allowed efficient communication between the porphyrin and phthalocyanine units. This is due to the flexibility of the side chains.

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of &#946;&#8208;Keto Esters Catalyzed by Chiral Calcium Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 2&#8208;aminoindane derivatives are a relatively common structural motif found in natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. Hence its highly desirable to develop efficient synthetic methods for enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters. A non&#8208;toxic chiral calcium phosphate&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with dibenzyl azodicarboxylate has been developed, generating chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoester derivatives in good yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters using (S)&#8208;BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%) and good yields (up to 99&#8201;%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1&#8208;tetralone&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale&#8208;up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.

     alt="Enantioselective Amination of &#946;-Keto Esters Catalyzed by Chiral Calcium Phosphates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chiral 2-aminoindane derivatives&lt;/b&gt; are a relatively common structural motif found in natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. Hence its highly desirable to develop efficient synthetic methods for enantioselective amination of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-keto esters. A non-toxic chiral calcium phosphate-catalyzed enantioselective amination of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ketoesters with dibenzyl azodicarboxylate has been developed, generating chiral &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-amino-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ketoester derivatives in good yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A catalytic enantioselective amination of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-keto esters using (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-amino-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%) and good yields (up to 99&#8201;%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1-tetralone-derived &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale-up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Anionic Fries Rearrangement Promoted by Lithium Amides under Aerobic Conditions in Sustainable Reaction Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, scalable, and sustainable access to salicylamides from O&#8208;aryl carbamates was achieved using lithium amides as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle metalating agents under bench&#8208;type aerobic conditions. Tunable regioselective ortho&#8208; and lateral metalations in eco&#8208;friendly cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) allow fast anionic migrations under air, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures.







Abstract
A straightforward and efficient protocol to promote the metalation/anionic Fries rearrangements of O&#8208;aryl carbamates, using for the first time a lithium amide as metalating agent under aerobic/ambient&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, is reported. This approach enables the sustainable preparation of salicylamide derivatives with high levels of chemoselectivity within ultrafast reaction times, working at room temperature in the presence of air/moisture, and using environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether as a solvent. Furthermore, the regioselective manipulation of O&#8208;2&#8208;tolyl carbamates has been accomplished using interchangeably alkyllithiums or lithium amides, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from the employment of biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures as non&#8208;innocent reaction media.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Glycosylated Cholera Toxin B Subunit as a Tracer of Glycoprotein Trafficking in Organelles of Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and chemically synthesized intentionally glycosylated cholera toxin B&#8208;subunit (glycosyl&#8208;CTB) as a tracer to investigate maturation and functions of N&#8208;glycans on the biosynthesis of glycoproteins. The obtained glycoprotein was successfully transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus of living cells.







Abstract
Glycosylation of proteins is known to be essential for changing biological activity and stability of glycoproteins on the cell surfaces and in body fluids. Delivering of homogeneous glycoproteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus would enable us to investigate the function of asparagine&#8208;linked (N&#8208;) glycans in the organelles. In this work, we designed and synthesized an intentionally glycosylated cholera toxin B&#8208;subunit (CTB) to be transported to the organelles of mammalian cells. The heptasaccharide, the intermediate structure of various complex&#8208;type N&#8208;glycans, was introduced to the CTB. The synthesized monomeric glycosyl&#8208;CTB successfully entered mammalian cells and was transported to the Golgi and the ER, suggesting the potential use of synthetic CTB to deliver and investigate the functions of homogeneous N&#8208;glycans in specific organelles of living cells.

         <dc:description>
Sequential nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohols has been achieved. Over&#8208;reaction was suppressed by rapid mixing through micro&#8208;flow technology, and asymmetric phosphotriesters containing acid&#8208; and/or base&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields. Moreover, a mechanistic study by using DFT calculations suggested interesting reaction pathways. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Fuse and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200932).

The flexibility of the bridging alkyl chains is important for proximity in the stacking of porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated through a fourfold rotaxane linkage. This picture shows a chochin, a Japanese lantern made with paper and thin strips of bamboo that can be expanded and contracted flexibly. This foldability recalls the induced molecular interaction in the flexible molecular conjugate. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al.

         <title>Cover Feature: Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons (Chem. Eur. J. 37/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A last piece of the puzzle? A method that significantly expands the diversity of molecules built in crystals by using principles of supramolecular chemistry is introduced. The approach relies on post&#8208;modification of aryl nitriles, which serve a dual role as hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to support intermolecular photodimerization and as organic functional groups that can undergo a variety of chemical transformations (e.&#8201;g., click reactivity). More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;R. MacGillivray and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200978).

         <dc:description>
Pulsed light can excite extensive light&#8208;absorbing materials with/without photosensitization property to generate photoacoustic signal for diagnosis and concurrent cavitation to trigger mechanical damage and notable multiple reactive species for disease therapy, which potentially broadens the scope of traditional photodynamic therapy using photosensitizers and continuous light irradiation.

         <title>Luminescent Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halides: An Emerging Class of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 37, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) are ideal as luminescent materials for stimuli&#8208;responsive technology due to their soft crystal lattice and high chemical activity. In this review, the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of luminescent OIMHs based on Sb3+, Bi3+, Pb2+, Mn2+ and so on under different stimuli, including contact, pressure, mechanical force, light, heat, and gas molecules, as well as the applications of the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors are summarized.







Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are well known as a new materials family in recent years. Novel materials and applications of luminescent OIMHs have been explored by changing either the organic component or the metal halide species. Thereinto, the stimuli&#8208;responsive (SR) phenomena in OIMHs have drawn much attention recently, for not only their attractive application potential but also the helpfulness in understanding the stability of OIMHs to the external environment. Herein, the luminescent OIMHs that are sensitive to external stimuli including contact, pressure, mechanical grinding, light, heat, and gas molecules, are reviewed, with an emphasis on analyses of the structural change during the SR process. The applications of SR luminescent OIMHs in widespread fields, including gas sensing, information encryption, and rewritable luminescent paper are summarized. Finally, the challenges that deserve to be further explored in this research field are discussed, which provides certain guidance for the future study of SR luminescent OIMHs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare examples of heavier alkali metal manganates [{(AM)Mn(CH  2  SiMe  3  )(N  `Ar  )  2  }  &#8734;  ] (AM = K, Rb, or Cs) [N  `Ar  = N(SiMe  3  )(Dipp)] have been synthesised with the Rb and Cs examples crystallographically characterised. These heaviest manganates crystallise as polymeric zig&#8208;zag chains propagated by AM&#8943;&#960;&#8208;arene interactions. Key to their preparation is to avoid Lewis base donor solvents. In contrast, using multidentate nitrogen donors encourages ligand scrambling leading to redistribution of these bimetallic manganate compounds into their corresponding homometallic species as witnessed for the complete Li &#8211; Cs series. Adding to the few known crystallographically characterised unsolvated and solvated rubidium and caesium s&#8208;block metal amides, six new derivatives ([{AM(N  `Ar  )}  &#8734;  ], [{AM(N  `Ar  )&#183;TMEDA}  &#8734;  ], and [{AM(N  `Ar  )&#183;PMDETA}  &#8734;  ] where AM = Rb or Cs) have been structurally authenticated. Utilising monodentate diethyl ether as a donor, it was also possible to isolate and crystallographically characterise sodium manganate [(Et  2  O)  2  Na(  n  Bu)Mn[(N  `Ar  )  2  ], a monomeric, dinuclear structure prevented from aggregating by two blocking ether ligands bound to sodium.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Allenyne&#8211;Alkyne [4 + 2] Cycloaddition and Its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new [4 + 2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8211;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Modulation of Antibiotic Resistance by Photoswitchable Cystobactamids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rise of antibiotic resistance causes a serious health care problem, and its counterfeit demands novel, innovative concepts. The combination of photopharmacology, enabling a light&#8208;controlled reversible modulation of drug activity, with antibiotic drug design has led to first photoswitchable antibiotic compounds derived from established scaffolds. In this study, we converted cystobactamids, gyrase&#8208;inhibiting natural products with an oligoaryl scaffold and highly potent antibacterial activities, into photoswitchable agents by inserting azobenzene in the  N  &#8208;terminal part and/or an acylhydrazone moiety near the  C&#8208;  terminus, yielding twenty analogs that contain mono&#8208; as well as double&#8208;switches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties could be modulated 3.4&#8208;fold and 5&#8208;fold by light, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of photoswitchable cystobactamids towards two known resistance factors, the peptidase AlbD and the scavenger protein AlbA, was light&#8208;dependent. While irradiation of an analog with an  N  &#8208;terminal azobenzene with 365 nm light led to less degradation by AlbD, the AlbA&#8208;mediated inactivation was induced. This provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that resistance towards photoswitchable antibiotics can be optically controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Water&#8208;Soluble Esterase&#8208;Activated CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules Targeting Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide (CO) as a cell&#8208;protective and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent, CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) offer promising potential applications in medicine. We synthesized a set of acyloxy&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes, all displaying a N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pyridinium triflate moiety in the ester side chain, as mitochondria&#8208;targeting esterase&#8208;triggered CORM prodrugs. While the compounds in which the acyloxy substituent is attached to the 2&#8208;position of the diene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 unit (A series) spontaneously release CO upon dissolution in phosphate buffer,&#160;which is partly suppressed in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE), the 1&#8208;substituted isomers (B series) show the expected PLE&#8208;induced release of CO (up to 3 equiv.). The biological activity of  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2  /  3&#8208;B  and their isophorone&#8208;derived analogs  2/3&#8208;A&#8217;  &#160;was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). While  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B  were not cytotoxic up to 500 &#181;M (MTT assay),  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;  caused significant toxicity at concentrations above 50 &#181;M. The anti&#8208;inflammatory potential of both Mito&#8208;CORM variants was demonstrated by concentration&#8208;dependent down&#8208;regulation of the pro&#8208;inflammatory markers&#160;as well as induction of HO&#8208;1 in TNF&#945; stimulated HUVEC. Energy phenotyping by Seahorse Real&#8208;Time Cell Metabolic Analysis, revealed opposing shifts&#160;of metabolic potentials (mitochondrial respiration/glycolytic activity)&#160;in cells treated either with  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B  &#160;or  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;. Thus, the Mito&#8208;CORMs represent valuable tools for the safe and targeted delivery of CO to mitochondria as a subcellular compartment to induce anti&#8208;inflammatory effects with only minor shifts in cellular energy metabolism.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide (CO) as a cell-protective and anti-inflammatory agent, CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) offer promising potential applications in medicine. We synthesized a set of acyloxy-cyclohexadiene-Fe(CO)3 complexes, all displaying a N-methyl-pyridinium triflate moiety in the ester side chain, as mitochondria-targeting esterase-triggered CORM prodrugs. While the compounds in which the acyloxy substituent is attached to the 2-position of the diene-Fe(CO)3 unit (A series) spontaneously release CO upon dissolution in phosphate buffer,&#160;which is partly suppressed in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE), the 1-substituted isomers (B series) show the expected PLE-induced release of CO (up to 3 equiv.). The biological activity of  Mito-CORMs 2  /  3-B  and their isophorone-derived analogs  2/3-A&#8217;  &#160;was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). While  Mito-CORMs 2/3-B  were not cytotoxic up to 500 &#181;M (MTT assay),  Mito-CORMs 2/3-A&#8217;  caused significant toxicity at concentrations above 50 &#181;M. The anti-inflammatory potential of both Mito-CORM variants was demonstrated by concentration-dependent down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory markers&#160;as well as induction of HO-1 in TNF&#945; stimulated HUVEC. Energy phenotyping by Seahorse Real-Time Cell Metabolic Analysis, revealed opposing shifts&#160;of metabolic potentials (mitochondrial respiration/glycolytic activity)&#160;in cells treated either with  Mito-CORMs 2/3-B  &#160;or  Mito-CORMs 2/3-A&#8217;. Thus, the Mito-CORMs represent valuable tools for the safe and targeted delivery of CO to mitochondria as a subcellular compartment to induce anti-inflammatory effects with only minor shifts in cellular energy metabolism. Also, due to their water solubility, these compounds provide&#160;promising options for further pharmacological studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of A Stable Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite with 15&#215;12&#215;12 Member&#8208;Ring Channels</title>

Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;13 is synthesized by using an easily obtained 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents, which possesses a rare 15&#215;12&#215;12&#8208;ring pore system. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain stable high silica and acidic aluminosilicate zeolites.







Abstract
Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents. NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.

         <title>H2, B&#8722;H, and Si&#8722;H Bond Activation and Facile Protonolysis Driven by Pt&#8208;Base Metal Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca dimethyl complexes feature various degrees of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;Me interactions and show Pt/Zn cooperative activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds, observed only when Zn is in close proximity to Pt, as well as facile protonolysis by water, MeOH and C&#8722;H bond of terminal acetylene.







Abstract
We report a series of heterobimetallic Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca complexes to study the effect of proximity of a dicationic base metal on the organometallic Pt species. Varying degrees of Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn and Zn interaction with the bridging Me group are achieved, showcasing snapshots of a hypothetical process of retrotransmetalation from Pt to Zn. In contrast, only weak interactions were observed for Ca with a Pt&#8208;bound Me group. Activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds leads to the formation of hydride&#8208;bridged Pt&#8722;H&#8722;Zn complexes, which is not observed in the absence of Zn, pointing out the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperation. Reactivity of PtMe2/M2+ with terminal acetylene, water and methanol is also studied, leading to facile protonation of one of the Me groups at the Pt center only when Zn is present. This study sheds light on various ways in which the presence of a 2+ metal cation significantly affects the reactivity of a common organoplatinum complex.

         <title>Enhancement of Mass and Charge Transfer during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without a Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass transfer of CO2 in aqueous solutions has been enhanced by surface hydrophobic modification. The in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy without any organic barrier layer facilitates charge transfer from catalysts to the reactant. With less obstruction to charge transfer, higher CO2 and lower H+ surface concentrations, the rate of generation of methanol from the CRR is elevated to up to 247.15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) represents a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. But mass&#8208;transfer limitations seriously hinder the forward step. Enhancing the surface hydrophobicity by using polymers has been proved to be one of the most efficient strategies. However, as macromolecular organics, polymers on the surface hinder the transfer of charge carriers from catalysts to reactants. Herein, we describe an in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy to enhance the surface hydrophobicity of TiO2 without a barrier layer of organics, thus facilitating the mass transfer of CO2 to catalysts and charge transfer. With less obstruction to charge transfer, a higher CO2, and lower H+ surface concentration, the photocatalytic CRR generation rate of methanol (CH3OH) is greatly enhanced to up to 247.15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, we investigated the overall defects; enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of catalysts provides a general and reliable method to improve the competitiveness of CRR.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record resonance: An anionic seven&#8208;vertex siliconoid cluster with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and a record upfield 29Si NMR chemical shift at &#8722;413.9&#8197;ppm is described. It was analyzed by magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations.







Abstract
The silanide [Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (1) transforms into the anionic siliconoid cluster [Si7{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (2) with four unsubstituted silicon atoms as a contact ion pair with [K([18]crown&#8208;6)] in C6D6 at room temperature within five weeks. Anion 2 was investigated by natural population analysis and visualization of intrinsic atomic orbitals. Magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations of 2 revealed two distinct strong diatropic vortices that sum up in one direction and create a strongly shielded apical silicon atom in 2.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Bimetallic Platinum (II)&#8208;Ferrocene Antitumor Agent Induces Non&#8208;Apoptotic Cell Death and Exerts in Vivo Efficacy</title>

A heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrid 2 circumvents apoptosis and multifactorial cisplatin resistance, exhibits multi&#8208;pronged action in cancer cells &#8208; promoting necroptosis and paraptosis, and exerts in&#8197;vivo anticancer efficacy in mice xenograft model.







Abstract
Despite phenomenal clinical success, the efficacy of platinum anticancer drugs is often compromised due to inherent and acquired drug resistant phenotypes in cancers. To circumvent this issue, we designed two heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrids that display multi&#8208;pronged anticancer action. In cancer cells, our best compound, 2, platinates DNA, produces reactive oxygen species, and has nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum as potential targets. The multi&#8208;modal mechanism of action of these hybrid agents lead to non&#8208;apoptotic cell death induction which enables circumventing apoptosis resistance and significant improvement in platinum cross resistance profile. Finally, in addition to describing detail mechanistic insights, we also assessed its stability in plasma and demonstrate anticancer efficacy in an in&#8197;vivo A2780 xenograft model. Strikingly, compared to oxaliplatin, our compound displays better tolerability, safety profile and efficacy in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Induced Circular Polarized Luminescence in One&#8208;Dimensional Manganese(II) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive 1D manganese(II) halide hybrid is successfully prepared by self&#8208;assembly of accessible amine acid salt and low&#8208;cost manganese chloride. The known d&#8211;d transition of Mn2+ in octahedral coordination results in strong red emission with PLQY as high as 67.1&#8197;%. The as&#8208;formed 1D manganese(II) hybrids exhibit excellent CD signals in ground state and distinguished CPL activity with dissymmetry factor g as high as 6.3*10&#8722;3 in excited state due to the existence of chiral amine acid salt.







Abstract
Circular polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials attract great attentions owing to their widely applications in 3D optical displays and encrypted transmission. Inspired by the strategies adopted in perovskite based CPL materials, herein, CPL&#8208;active hybrids (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3 were successfully prepared by assembling chiral D/L tert&#8208;butyl prolinate with manganese (II) chloride. Single crystal structures show the as&#8208;formed hybrids possess one&#8208;dimensional (1D) structure containing linear chains of face&#8208;sharing MnCl6 octahedral surrounded by prolinate cations. The 1D Mn(II) hybrids display strong red emission peaked at 646&#8197;nm with PLQY of 67.1&#8197;% and 57.2&#8197;% for d&#8208;type and l&#8208;type, respectively, representing the highest PLQY for 1D MnII hybrids. Interestingly, the 1D Mn(II) hybrids exhibit prominent circular dichroism (CD) signals and remarkable CPL activity with the dissymmetry factor g of 6.1*10&#8722;3 and &#8722;6.3*10&#8722;3 from 550 to 800&#8197;nm for (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3, respectively, owing to the existence of chiral cations. It is worthy noted the obtained g represents the highest value for non&#8208;lead organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids.

         <title>Ag Doped Au44 Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6) cluster has been synthesized and the Ag doping positions can be precisely determined. The electrochemical reduction process of CO2 to CO can be promoted by Ag doping into Au cluster, due to the modulated electronic properties and structural reconstruction by Ag doping. The work provides an opportunity for understanding the heteroatom&#8208;doping role in modulating the catalytic properties of metal clusters.







Abstract
A novel Ag doped Au44(C10H9)28 nanocluster (C10H10=1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzene) was synthesized, that is, Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6), where four Ag positions located in the surface staple of the cluster have been determined, while six Au/Ag co&#8208;occupying positions have been found in the metal core of the cluster. The electronic configuration of Au44(C10H9)28 cluster is significantly disturbed by doping Ag atoms, hence promoting the electron transport capability. For the two&#8208;electron conversion reaction of CO2 to CO in electrochemical reduction of CO2, Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 catalyst exhibited higher effective activity and long&#8208;term stability than its counterpart Au44(C10H9)28 catalyst.

         <title>From Nanoparticle Ensembles to Single Nanoparticles: Techniques for the Investigation of Plasmon Enhanced Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC), where specific electrochemical reactions are promoted due to the reduced energy barrier of the reaction processes by the light excited &#8220;hot carriers&#8221; of the plasmonic nanoparticles, has aroused tremendous interest in recent years. A deep understanding of the PEEC process becomes a key issue for facilitating PEEC catalyst design and improving PEEC performance. This concept article begins with a brief discussion of the macroscopic electrochemical method of PEEC study of the plasmonic nanoparticle ensembles. Following that, we highlight two electrochemical techniques that may possess single nanoparticle sensitivity,  i.e.  , scanning electrochemical microscope and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. The pros and cons of each technique are discussed and an outlook is given. We hope to provide the readers with the current status of PEEC to evoke reflections regarding the reaction mechanisms, performance improvement, and the utilizations to important systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Loading and High&#8208;Performing Ionic Liquid&#8208;Immobilizing Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst (MTOA)5[SiW11O39Rh] (MOTA=methyltrioctylammonium cation), which can afford exceptionally high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes at an ultralow loading of Rh (ca. 3 ppm). For styrene hydroformylation, both the conversion and the yield of the aldehyde can reach almost 99%, and the TOF was obtained as high as 9000 h&#8208;1 without usage of any phosphine ligand in the reaction process. The further characterization by FT&#8208;IR, ICP and ESI&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the Rh single atom was incorporated in the lacunary POM anions. Especially, the bulky IL cation can provide an additional role in stabilizing Rh species and thus prevented from aggregation and leaching of Rh species. The IL catalyst was miscible with n&#8208;hexane under the elevated temperature conditions, which contributed to exceptionally high activity for hydroformylation even at ultra&#8208;low loading of IL catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxygenated Sesquiterpenoids Enabled by Combining Metabolic Engineering and Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;Chem collaboration: Escherichia coli fermentation and visible&#8208;light photocatalysis were combined in a complementary way for the first time, to realize the scaffold assembly in a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; fashion and the subsequent diversifications in a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; manner, respectively, enabling the production of six sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, genetically engineered Escherichia coli fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene was combined with metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone, cis&#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8722;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. It was shown that the anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereo&#8208;electronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.

         <title>Alkylation of Nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution &#8211; Experimental and DFT Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS) was tested experimentally and modelled with DFT calculations. Mechanistic studies reveal intrinsic differences between reactions of archetypal carbanion precursor PhSO2CH2Cl, and alkyl phenyl sulfones, in which benzenesulfinate acts as a leaving group. Accordingly, for the latter precursors steric hindrance develops at the &#946;&#8208;elimination step, that raises energy barrier and results in the formation of byproducts.

Playing domino: Cu&#8208;catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multiheterocyclic structures.

Abstract
Cu&#8208;Catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multiheterocyclic structures from &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides is reported. This domino reaction strategy enables the construction of multiheterocycles in one step. Mechanistic studies showed that two catalytically generated iminiums are likely to be key intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used in a chemoselective manner to produce multicyclic products in the reaction with ketones possessing two different carbonyls.

         <title>Study of Carbamoyl Fluoride: Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F plan: Carbamoyl fluorides can be synthesized easily and safely under metal&#8208;free and inexpensive conditions. These compounds are stable under a wide range of conditions, especially close to physiologic ones. In addition, they can be radiolabeled by 18F/19F isotopic exchange.







Abstract
Carbamoyl fluoride is a fluorinated group that, to this date, remains underexplored, probably due to the lack of data concerning its properties. In this paper, a study of carbamoyl fluoride is presented. Stability studies, in particular under physiological conditions, and lipophilicity measurement were performed. A new easy, safe, inexpensive, and metal&#8208;free synthesis method is also described. Finally, a potential use in radiochemistry through a 18F/19F isotopic exchange is demonstrated.

These complexes have shown a rich derivative chemistry both at the germanium (chloride substitutions) and rhodium atoms (ligand substitutions, oxidative additions), providing tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexacoordinate rhodium complexes, some of which are also active catalyst precursors (olefin hydroboration).







Abstract
A family of germyl rhodium complexes derived from the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 (1), has been prepared. Germylene 1 reacted readily with [RhCl(PPh3)3] and [RhCl(cod)(PPh3)] (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) to give, in both cases, the PGeP&#8208;pincer chloridogermyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (2). Similarly, the reaction of 1 with [RhCl(cod)(MeCN)] afforded [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(MeCN)] (3). The methoxidogermyl and methylgermyl rhodium(I) complexes [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (R=OMe, 4; Me, 5) were prepared by treating complex 2 with LiOMe and LiMe, respectively. Complex 5 readily reacted with CO to give the carbonyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(CO)] (6), with HCl, HSnPh3 and Ph2S2 rendering the pentacoordinate methylgermyl rhodium(III) complexes [RhHX{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (X=Cl, 7; SnPh3, 8) and [Rh(SPh)2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (9), respectively, and with H2 to give the hexacoordinate derivative [RhH2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (10). Complexes 3 and 5 are catalyst precursors for the hydroboration of styrene, 4&#8208;vinyltoluene and 4&#8208;vinylfluorobenzene with catecholborane under mild conditions.

         <title>Effect of Annulation Mode of Twistarene on the Physical Property and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior of Functionalized Curved Aromatic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is of great significance. Herein this work describes the design and modular preparation of four novel arenes where their structures are determined via X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors and switchable photoconductivity of such curved molecules were investigated in detail.







Abstract
Four novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3&#8201;a, 5, 8, 15&#8201;a have been synthesized and characterized, where molecules 3&#8201;a and 15&#8201;a bear [5]carbohelicene units. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses indicate that compound 3&#8201;a shows offset packing arrangements of (P5)&#8208; and (M5)&#8208;isomers, and 15&#8201;a has a symmetrical plane and looks like a butterfly. In comparison, 8 exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42&#8197;&#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as&#8208;prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.

         <title>Lanthanide SMMs Based on Belt Macrocycles: Recent Advances and General Trends</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A belt to control anisotropy. This review presents the development of mononuclear lanthanide SMMs based on belt macrocycles. Literature systems are classified in crown ethers, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown complexes. Molecule families are compared in terms of their coordination number and geometry, focusing on the degree of structural distortion associated with different belt macrocycles. General trends with respect to demagnetization barriers and effective suppression of transverse magnetic anisotropy components are also discussed.







Abstract
Enhancement of axial magnetic anisotropy is the central objective to push forward the performance of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) complexes. In the case of mononuclear lanthanide complexes, the chemical environment around the paramagnetic ion must be tuned to place strongly interacting ligands along either the axial positions or the equatorial plane, depending on the oblate or prolate preference of the selected lanthanide. One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial&#8208;equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) Through Synthetic Optimisation and Postsynthetic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexibility of the MOF MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) is described and compared to its well&#8208;established Fe analogue. Its breathing behaviour can be controlled through installation of formate bridges during synthesis that ensure rigidity by structural buttressing, or by postsynthetic bromination of the fumarate linker to induce rigidity by the steric influence of the bulky linker substituents.







Abstract
Breathing behaviour in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties. In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre&#8208;synthetically using functionalised linkers. Herein, it was shown that MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by 1) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate&#8208;buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous; and 2) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non&#8208;porous. In addition to providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, it was shown that bromination of the formate&#8208;bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Platform for Novel Reaction Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of new chemical bond formation in high&#8208;throughput synthesis is limited by the efficiency and scalability of reaction product detection, as conventional methods for product isolation from reaction mixtures are time consuming and labor intensive. Here, we report a miniaturizable purification method that enables rapid, high&#8208;throughput isolation of quaternary ammonium&#8208;tagged products from reaction mixtures with excellent purity using inexpensive equipment that can be easily set up in a typical organic chemistry laboratory. This novel purification technique enabled us to establish a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. We validated this platform in a screen of 1536 reactions, which identified one&#160;previously unreported transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Adipic Esters and Adiponitrile via Photoassisted Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon 6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized butane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Insight into Photo&#8208;induced Damages of Unnatural Base Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) are important to maintain the genetic code integrity, and critical for developing healthy semisynthetic organisms. As reported, dTPT3 was less stable upon irradiation, and thus might act as a pervasive photosensitizer to induce oxidative damages within DNA, causing harm to living semi&#8208;synthetic organisms when exposed to UVA radiation. However, there was no knowledge about molecular&#8208;level understanding of this damage process. In this paper, we not only identified four photoproducts of dTPT3, including desulfur&#8208;dTPT3 (dTPT3  H  ), TPT3 sulphinate (TPT3  SO2  ), TPT3 sulphonate (TPT3  SO3  ) and TPT3&#8208;thioTPT3 (TPT3  S  TPT3), but also established a Type II photosensitized oxidation mechanism. In addition, the antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) was able to effectively inhibit the photoproducts formation of dTPT3 and dTPT3 in DNA, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA bearing dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects. The comprehensive understanding of TPT3&#8217; photochemical stability will give researchers helpful guidance to design more photo&#8208;stable UBPs and construct healthier semisynthetic organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Sorption Controls Extreme Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single Crystal Molecular Reorganization in Hydrogen Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because hydrogen bonded frameworks are held together by relatively weak interactions, they often form several different frameworks under slightly different synthesis conditions, and respond dynamically to stimuli such as heat and vacuum. However, these dynamic restructuring processes are often poorly understood. In this work, three isoreticular hydrogen bonded organic frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted amidinium&#183;&#183;&#183;carboxylate hydrogen bonds (1C/C, 1Si/C and 1Si/Si) are studied. Three distinct phases for 1C/C and four for 1Si/C and 1Si/Si are fully structurally characterized. The transitions between these phases involve extreme yet recoverable molecular&#8208;level framework reorganization. It is demonstrate that these transformations are related to water content and can be controlled by humidity, and that the non&#8208;porous anhydrous phase of 1C/C shows reversible water sorption through single crystal to crystal restructuring. This mechanistic insight opens the way for the future use of the inherent dynamism present in hydrogen bonded frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformations of Strained Three&#8208;Membered Rings as Common, Yet Overlooked Motif in Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum mechanical tunneling has long been recognized as an important phenomenon when considering transformations dominated by a lightweight hydrogen atom. Tunneling of heavier atoms like carbon, initially dismissed as negligible, has seen a quickly increasing number of computationally predicted and/or experimentally confirmed examples over the last decade, highlighting its importance for a wide variety of reactions. However, no common structural motif has been pointed out within these seemingly unconnected examples, strongly limiting the predictability of the impact of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling on a given reaction. This Concept Article will provide this perspective and showcase how the recognition of the formation and cleavage of three&#8208;membered rings as common motif can inform the prediction and research into heavy&#8208;atom tunneling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 separation by imide/imine organic cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel imide/imine&#8208;based organic cages were prepared and studied as materials for the selective separation of CO  2  from N  2  and CH  4  in Vacuum Swing Adsorption conditions. Gas adsorption on the new compounds showed selectivity for CO  2  over N  2  and CH  4  . The cages were also tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation. Dense and robust membranes were obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid  &#174;  or PEEK&#8208;WC polymers. Improved gas transport properties and selectivity for CO  2  were achieved compared to the neat polymer membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coordination Network Featuring Two Distinct Copper(II) Coordination Environments for Highly Selective Acetylene Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#183;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8209;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single&#8208;crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#160;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#183;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8209;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3-formyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single-crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#160;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Activation of Small Molecules by a Stable Chiral Silene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the dilithium salt of the enantiopure (  S  )&#8208;BINOL (1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol) with two equivalents of the amidinate&#8208;stabilized chlorosilylene L  Ph  SiCl (L  Ph  = PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ) led to the formation of the first example of a chiral cyclic silene species comprising a (  S  )&#8208;BINOL ligand. The reactivity of the Si=C bond was investigated by reaction with elemental sulfur, CO  2  and HCl. Reaction with S  8  led to a Si=C bond cleavage and concomitant to a ring&#8208;opened product with imine and silanethione functional groups. Reaction with CO  2  resulted in cleaving of the CO  2  molecule into a carbonyl group and an isolated O atom, while one new stereocenter is formed in a highly selective manner. According to DFT calculations, the [2+2] cycloaddition product is the key intermediate. Further reactivity studies of the chiral cyclic silene with HCl resulted in a stereoselective addition to the Si=C bond, while the fully selective formation of two stereocenters was achieved. The quantitative stereoselective addition of CO  2  and HCl to a Si=C bond is unprecedented.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic signature of dynamical instability of the aqueous complex in the brown&#8208;ring nitrate test</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of the brown&#8208;ring test has been investigated for nearly a century. Though recent studies have focused on solid state structure determination and the measurement of spectra, mechanistic details and kinetics, the aspects of solution structure and dynamics remain unknown. We have investigated structural fluctuations of the brown&#8208;ring complex in aqueous solution with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, from which we identified that the classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+  complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal&#160;[Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+  complex. Based on the inability in multi&#8208;reference calculations to reproduce the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectra in aqueous solution by inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+  complex alone, we propose the existence of an equilibrium between pseudo&#8208;octahedral and square&#8208;pyramidal complexes. Despite challenges in constructing models reproducing the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum, the advanced spectrum simulation tool motivates us to challenge the established picture of a sole pseudo&#8208;octahedral complex in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Mannosylerythritol Lipid Analogues and their Self&#8208;Assembling Properties, Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells, and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of three types of purpose&#8208;designed mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL)&#8208;D analogues with decanoyl groups (C10), &#946;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, &#945;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, and &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D, was accomplished utilizing our boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) methods. Their self&#8208;assembling properties, recovery effects on damaged skin cells, and antibacterial activity were evaluated. It was revealed, for the first time, that &#945;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D&#160;and &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D only generated giant vesicles, indicating that slight differences in the steric configuration of an erythritol moiety and fatty acyl chains affect the ability to form vesicles. Analogue &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D exhibited significant recovery effects on damaged skin cells. Furthermore, &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D exhibited antibacterial activity as high as that for MEL&#8208;D, indicating that &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D is a promising artificial sugar&#8208;based material candidate for enhancing the barrier function of the stratum corneum, superior to a known cosmetic ingredient, and possesses antibacterial activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Aza&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides as Reactive Intermediates: Generation and Utility in Contemporary Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has been showing budding progress in the past years. Herein, the asymmetric catalysis involving these transient intermediates is highlighted, which was made possible by well&#8208;designed catalysts as well as new aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM precursors/substrates.







Abstract
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has overwhelmingly progressed in the past few decades. This review aims to integrate various transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalytic strategies in taming aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM intermediates, including the aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;vinylidene quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;VQM), aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynyl quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;AQM), aza&#8208;para&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;p&#8208;QM), and indole&#8208;based aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM analog. These transient species are often utilized for the direct and enantioselective synthesis of complex (hetero)polycyclic or fused&#8208;ring molecular scaffolds such as tetrahydroquinoline and indoline, among others, which are abundant in many natural products, bioactive compounds, and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Installing Reduction Responsiveness into Biomolecules by Introducing Nitroaryl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RSVP: This Concept summarizes the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, constructed by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, with a focus on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.







Abstract
Artificially synthesized stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecules are attractive as molecular tools for monitoring and modulating biological systems. In biological systems, redox stimuli are common, and their dysregulation is typically linked to various abnormal or disease states. In this Concept article, the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, which are produced by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, is reviewed with a special emphasis on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.

         <title>Persulfurated Benzene&#8208;Cored Asterisks with &#960;&#8208;Extended ThioNaphthyl Arms: Synthesis, Structural, Photophysical and Covalent Dynamic Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Regioisomeric asterisks (5&#8208;6) with naphthylthio arms are reported. Consequences on &#960;&#8208;extension around a persulfurated benzene bring different structural, photophysical and chemical properties. Sulfur exchanges reactions convert non emissive (5&#8211;6) into the best one (4). &#960;&#8208;Extension inhibits luminescence of a hexakis(phenylthio)benzene unit. Sc&#8208;XRD shows structural distortions and different behaviors of (5&#8211;6).







Abstract
The synthesis of regioisomeric asterisks (5) and (6) incorporating a benzene core with six 1&#8208;naphthylthio or six 2&#8208;naphthylthio arms are reported in search for new materials with optoelectronic properties. The consequences on the extension of a &#960; system surrounding a persulfurated benzene core provide a new avenue to study the structural, photophysical, and chemical properties of such family of all&#8208;organic phosphors. It also diverts the persulfuration mechanism after two radical cyclizations for making a [5]dithiohelicene by&#8208;product (7) and favors dynamic sulfur component exchange reactions surrounding the core. These exchanges convert asterisks (5) and (6), non&#8208;phosphorescent at 20&#8201;&#176;C to the highly phosphorescent (4) (&#981; &#8764;100&#8201;%, solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C). For asterisks (5) and (6), the absence of the typical phosphorescence of the per(phenylthio)benzene core in the solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C and the presence of a weak naphthalene&#8208;based phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K is attributed to an energy transfer from the triplet state of the persulfurated benzene core to the outer naphthalene moieties, resulting in an antenna system.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activated Liposomal Cell Delivery using a Boronate&#8208;Caged Guanidine Lipid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid for enhancing liposome cellular delivery mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reported. Our results showcase that this lipid enables cell delivery only after being activated in the presence of ROS. This approach exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.







Abstract
We report boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid 1 that activates liposomes for cellular delivery only upon uncaging of this compound by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce cationic lipid products. These liposomes are designed to mimic the exceptional cell delivery properties of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), while the inclusion of the boronate cage is designed to enhance selectivity such that cell entry will only be activated in the presence of ROS. Boronate uncaging by hydrogen peroxide was verified by mass spectrometry and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. A microplate&#8208;based fluorescence assay was developed to study the ROS&#8208;mediated vesicle interactions between 1&#8208;liposomes and anionic membranes, which were further elucidated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cellular delivery studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy demonstrated significant enhancements in cellular delivery only when 1&#8208;liposomes were incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showcase that lipid 1 exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.

         <title>Tailoring the NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence of Single Thiolated Au25 Nanoclusters by Selective Binding to Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocluster in a jewel case: A single, atomically precise gold nanocluster (Au25) has been incorporated inside bovine serum albumin protein. A striking increase in Au25&#8208;BSA NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence was observed as compared to Au25. The results reveal the intricate role of protein rigidification and the involvement of different excited states in the generation of NIR&#8208;II emissions.

         <title>Modeling Heme Peroxidase: Heme Saddling Facilitates Reactions with Hyperperoxides to Form High&#8208;Valent Fe(IV)&#8211;Oxo Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saddle&#8208;shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases, and how such macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of Fe(III) hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) to form high&#8208;valent Fe&#8211;oxo species remains uncertain. We investigated the reactions of two Fe(III) porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely Fe III (OETPP)ClO  4  (  1  OE  ) and Fe III (OMTPP)ClO  4  (  1  OM  ), with tert &#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (  t&#8208;  BuOOH) in CH 2 Cl 2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8211;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable Fe(III)&#8211;alkylperoxo intermediate, Fe III&#8211;O(H)OR (  2  ) into Fe(IV)&#8211;oxo porphyrins (  3  ) through examination of the ESI&#8208;MS spectra, absorption changes and 1 H NMR chemical shifts. Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [  t  &#8208;BuOOH]&#8208;dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40 &#176;C, the reaction of  1  OE  with t &#8208;BuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant ( K  a  = 362.3 M  &#8722;1  ) and rate constant ( k = 1.87 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  s  &#8722;1  ) for the homolytic cleavage of the  2  O&#8211;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times, respectively, those exhibited by 1 OM ( K  a  =171.8 M  &#8722;1  and k = 1.36 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  s  &#8722;1  ). DFT calculations indicated that an Fe(III) porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d  z2  ,d  x2&#8211;y2  )&#8211;porphyrin(a  2u  )]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8211;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8211;O cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesized Cd&#8208;Doped Cs3Cu2I5: Stable and Excitation&#8208;Wavelength Dependent Dual&#8208;Color Emission for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was synthesized by room&#8208;temperature grinding. [CuI4] and [CdI4] tetrahedrons act as photoluminescent centers separately, resulting in the emission colour manipulated by not only Cd feeding amount but also excitation wavelength. The as&#8208;prepared Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was made into anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink and printed on paper. The pattern shows different colours when the excitation wavelength increases from 310&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm.







Abstract
With the development of intellectual properties, concern about advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single&#8208;modal luminescence can no longer satisfy. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper&#8208;based perovskite shows great potential to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emissions. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs3Cu2I5 and showed resultant emission at 560&#8197;nm which surprisingly showed a red&#8208;shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self&#8208;trapped emission, resulting in excitation&#8208;wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increased from 290&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm, the emission of Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for silk&#8208;screen printing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cd-doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized by room-temperature grinding. [CuI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and [CdI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] tetrahedrons act as photoluminescent centers separately, resulting in the emission colour manipulated by not only Cd feeding amount but also excitation wavelength. The as-prepared Cd-doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; was made into anti-counterfeiting ink and printed on paper. The pattern shows different colours when the excitation wavelength increases from 310&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of intellectual properties, concern about advanced anti-counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single-modal luminescence can no longer satisfy. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper-based perovskite shows great potential to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emissions. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and showed resultant emission at 560&#8197;nm which surprisingly showed a red-shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self-trapped emission, resulting in excitation-wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increased from 290&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm, the emission of Cd-doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd-doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti-counterfeiting ink for silk-screen printing. Meanwhile, Cd-doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; maintains outstanding stability after doping, no matter under ambient, continuous UV radiation or high-temperature environment. The intensity can be almost totally recovered after heating-and-cooling cycles. This study lays groundwork for future research into multiple luminescent center manipulation in 0D materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Nor&#8208;Cedrene and Nor&#8208;Isozizaene Sesquiterpenoids and Exploration of Their Olfactive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of isozizaene&#8208; and cedrene&#8208;type nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids from a simple bio&#8208;inspired precursor nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide is described. This key intermediate undergoes selective cyclization cascades without the need for enzymatic control. By choosing cationic or radical cyclization conditions, each sesquiterpene scaffold could be prepared selectively and led to the discovery of new woody odorants of perfumery interest.







Abstract
We report the preparation of nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide 13 and its use as a common biomimetic intermediate for the synthesis of nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids. Through a cationic cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;isozizaenol 25, ultimately constituting an eight&#8208;step access to this complex sesquiterpenoid from inexpensive and abundant starting materials. Using a radical cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;cedryl alcohol 26 from the same intermediate. Derivatization of these two products led to the discovery of two potent woody odorants of interest in perfumery.

         <title>Different Enzyme Conformations Induce Different Mechanistic Traits in HIV&#8208;1 Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence and divergence: Using multiple conformations (previously characterized by adiabatic methods) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, we assessed the convergence of activation free energies and the mechanistic divergence of the first step in the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease. The mechanistic divergence for this step was still present and our barriers spanned a range of 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The influence of the dynamical flexibility of enzymes on reaction mechanisms is a cornerstone in biological sciences. In this study, we aim to 1)&#8197;study the convergence of the activation free energy by using the first step of the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease as a case study, and 2)&#8197;provide further evidence for a mechanistic divergence in this enzyme, as two different reaction pathways were seen to contribute to this step. We used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, on four different initial conformations that led to different barriers in a previous study. Despite the sampling, the four activation free energies still spanned a range of 5.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, the new simulations did confirm the occurrence of an unusual mechanistic divergence, with two different mechanistic pathways displaying equivalent barriers. An active&#8208;site water molecule is proposed to influence the mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Dynamics of Naphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;based photon upconversion involves the fusion of two non&#8208;emissive triplet excited states into one singlet excited state. The TTA process in naphthalene is found to be mediated by conical intersection between the T1T1 and S1S0 states. The coupling of an optical cavity to a naphthalene dimer results in an increase in the efficiency of TTA&#8208;assisted photon upconversion process. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gudem and M. Kowalewski (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200781).

         <title>Bioinspired Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration by Covalently Metalated Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural photosynthesis is a highly unified biocatalytic system, which coupled cofactor (NAD(P)H) regeneration and enzymatic CO  2  reduction efficiently for solar energy conversion. Mimicking nature, a novel system with Rh complex covalently grafted onto NH  2  &#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitride (NH  2  &#8208;PCN) was constructed. The integrated connection of the light&#8208;harvesting and electron mediation modules as Rh  m3  &#8208;N&#8208;PCN could promote the efficient NAD  +  reduction to NADH. As a result, the integrated system exhibited a conversion of ~66% within 20 minutes. By further coupling in&#8208;situ generated NADH with formate&#160;dehydrogenase (FDH), a photoenzymatic production of formic acid (HCOOH) from CO  2  was accomplished. Moreover, by immobilizing FDH onto a hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production of ~5.0 mM can be obtained due to the concentrated CO  2  on the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface. Our work herein provides an integrated strategy for coupling the anchored electron mediator with immobilized enzyme for enhanced artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

As a result, the integrated system exhibited a conversion of ~66% within 20 minutes. By further coupling in-situ generated NADH with formate&#160;dehydrogenase (FDH), a photoenzymatic production of formic acid (HCOOH) from CO  2  was accomplished. Moreover, by immobilizing FDH onto a hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production of ~5.0 mM can be obtained due to the concentrated CO  2  on the gas-liquid-solid three-phase interface. Our work herein provides an integrated strategy for coupling the anchored electron mediator with immobilized enzyme for enhanced artificial photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Between two chairs: Combination of theory and experiment for the determination of the conformational dynamics of xylosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Electrophilicities of Diazoalkanes: Kinetics and Mechanism of Azo Couplings with Enamines and Sulfonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetics and mechanism of the reactions of methyl diazoacetate, dimethyl diazomalonate, 4&#8208;nitrophenyldiazo&#173;methane, and diphenyldiazomethane with sulfonium ylides and enamines were investigated by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. Ordinary alkenes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with these diazo compounds. In contrast, sulfonium ylides and enamines attack at the terminal nitrogen of the diazo alkanes to give zwitterions, which undergo various subsequent reactions. As only one new bond is formed in the rate&#8208;determining step of these reactions, the correlation lg  k  2  (20 &#176;C) =  s  N  (  N  +  E  ) could be used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities  E  of the diazo compounds from the measured second&#8208;order rate constants and the known reactivity indices  N  and  s  N  of the sulfonium ylides and enamines. The resulting electrophilicity parameters (&#8211;21 &lt;  E  &lt; &#8232;&#8211;18), which are 11&#8211;14 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the benzenediazonium ion, are used to define the scope of one&#8208;bond nucleophiles which may react with these diazoalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry
Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystal of Ru(III) Complexes with Six
Imidazole&#8211;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new H&#8208;bonded crystal [Ru III (Him) 3 (Im) 3 ] with three
imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im &#8211; ) groups was prepared to
obtain a high&#8208;temperature proton conductor. The crystal is
constructed by complementary N&#8208;H&#8230;N H&#8208;bonds between the Ru III
complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic topology&#8208;net with a two&#8208;fold
interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton
conductivity of 3.08 &#197;~ 10 &#8211;5 S/cm at 450 K and faster conductivity than
those formed by only HIm groups. The high proton conductivity is
attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm
frameworks that are activated at ~113 K, but also isotropic wholemolecule
rotation of [Ru III (Him) 3 (Im) 3 ] at temperatures greater than
420 K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 2 H&#8208;NMR
spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and
theoretically considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate specific protein&#8722;protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate high pressure&#8208;sensitivity of globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The addition of excipients has a minor effect, only. The high pressure&#8208;sensitivity observed is due to the fact that these flexible Y&#8208;shaped molecules create a considerable amount of void volume in the condensed phase, leading to an overall decrease of the volume of the system upon dissociation of the droplet phase by pressure already at a few ten to hundred bar. Moreover, we show that immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly pressure resistant against unfolding and can even sustain pressures up to about 6 kbar without conformational changes. This implies that immunoglobulins are resistant to pressure treatment of foods, such as milk, in high&#8208;pressure food processing technologies, thereby preserving their immunological activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (  OAPPDO  s) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core which is formally condensed with N&#8208;substituted urea units in the two opposite  peri  positions.

Starting from the latter, a series of  bay  arylated  OAPPDO  s has been synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling which resulted in the formation of helically chiral  OAPPDO  derivatives. The electrochemical and photo physical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. The  P  &#8208; and  M  &#8208;enantiomers of a phenylated  OAPPDO  were separated by semipreparative HPLC column chromatography and further analyzed by CD&#8208;spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies, the mechanism of the isomerization, the electronic excitation and the CD spectrum (TD&#8208;DFT) were computed and compared to the experimental data. The reversible 1e  &#8208;  oxidation of the  OAPPDO  s generates the corresponding radical cations, one of which was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The reversible oxidation process was also systematically investigated by spectroelectrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Electron Density Analysis of Chemical Bonding in Graphitic Carbon Nitride Precursor Melamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g&#8208;CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave&#8208;like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3 &#197; similar to that of g&#8208;CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction data measured at 25 K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra&#8208; and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions. Theoretical gas phase optimizations of the experimental molecular geometry show that bond lengths and angles for atoms in same chemical environment (C&#8208;N bonds in the ring, amine groups) differ significantly more for the experimental geometry than for the gas phase optimized geometries, indicating that intermolecular interactions in the crystal affects the molecular geometry. In the experimental crystal geometry, one amine group has significantly more sp  3  &#8208;like character than the others, hinting towards a possible formation mechanism of g&#8208;CN. Topological analysis and energy frameworks show that the nitrogen atom in this amine group participates in weak intralayer hydrogen bonding. We hypothesize that melamine condenses to g&#8208;CN within the layers and that the unique amine group plays a key role in the condensation process.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g-CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave-like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3 &#197; similar to that of g-CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X-ray single crystal diffraction data measured at 25 K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra- and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;-interactions.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;based materials as lithium hosts for lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal has attracted significant attention in areas that range from basic research to various commercial applications due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h g&#8722;1  ) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, dendrites often form on the surfaces of Li metal anodes during cycling and thus lead to battery failure and, in some cases, raise safety concerns. To overcome this problem, a variety of approaches that vary the electrolyte, membrane, and/or anode have been proposed. Among these efforts, the use of three&#8208;dimensional frameworks as Li hosts, which can homogenize and minimize the current density at the anode surface, is an effective approach to suppress the formation of Li dendrites. Herein, we describe the development of using carbon&#8208;based materials as Li hosts. While these materials can be fabricated with a variety of porous structures, they have a number of intrinsic advantages including low cost, a high specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, wide electrochemical stability. After briefly summarizing the Li dendrites formation mechanisms, various methods for controlling structural and surface chemistry will be described for different types of carbon&#8208;based materials from the viewpoint of improving their performance as Li hosts. Finally, we provide perspective on the future development of Li host materials needed to meet the requirements for their use in flexible and wearable devices and other contemporary energy storage techniques.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complex comprising one [Re(CO)3]+  unit and a phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand (Re1Pc) is shown to function as a photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule (photoCORM) in the presence of O2  and a coordinative solvent under irradiation with red light, which can deeply penetrate living tissues. Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements indicate very short excited&#8208;state lifetimes and ultrafast intersystem crossing for  Re1Pc  and  Re2Pc, which contains two [Re(CO)3]+  units. The excited&#8208;state properties are ascribed to efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and large Franck&#8208;Condon factors originating from the complexes&#8217; distorted structures, i.e., unsymmetric coordination of [Re(CO)3]+  unit(s), one of which was confirmed via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of a symmetrically&#8208;substituted Pc with two [Re(CO)3]+  units.  Re1Pc  represents a promising red light&#8208;driven photoCORM that can be applied in biological environments or therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity recognition of organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8211;BF&#160;3&#160;&#8211;) as designer guest molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recognition of boron compounds is well developed as boronic acids but untapped as organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8211;BF  3  &#8211;  ). We are exploring the development of these and other designer anions as anion&#8208;recognition motifs by considering them as substituted versions of the parent inorganic ion. To this end, we demonstrate strong and reliable binding of organic trifluoroborates, R&#8722;BF  3  &#8722;  , by cyanostar macrocycles that are size&#8208;complementary to the inorganic BF  4  &#8211;  &#160;progenitors. We find that recognition is modulated by the substituent&#8217;s sterics and that the affinities are retained using the common K  +  &#160;salts of R&#8211;BF  3  &#8211;  &#160;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;CF3 Imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one Derivatives via Photocatalytic and Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported methodologies open access to the mono&#8208;substituted N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones at the 4&#8208;position which was previously inaccessible. Directly from the linear N&#8208;CF3 ureas bearing an alkene moiety, N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones were prepared via Ag&#8208;catalysis and light assisted proton coupled electron transfer. Instead of prior modification of the alkene moiety, tandem PCET and Nickel catalysis were shown to increase the diversity of the core. The cyclic compounds were then treated under various conditions to modify the core structure to introduce structural complexity.







Abstract
While the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of cyclic ureas is of interest for the potential to fundamentally change the properties of these biologically relevant moieties, the single synthetic procedure known to date describing their access only gives 4,4&#8208;disubstituted or fused aromatic cyclic N&#8208;CF3 urea derivatives. We herein report an alternative approach to unleash access to the 4&#8208;monosubstituted imidazolidinone motif. The strategy relies on straightforward cyclization of readily accessible acyclic ureas, enabled by Ag&#8208;catalysis or light&#8208;assisted proton coupled electron transfer. The cyclic core is shown to be highly robust and amenable to various derivatizations, such as tandem Ni&#8208;catalysis, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C cross couplings or C&#8722;H functionalizations, tolerating basic, nucleophilic and/or oxidizing conditions.

         <title>Tuning Deazaflavins Towards Highly Potent Reducing Photocatalysts Guided by Mechanistic Understanding &#8211; Enhancement of the Key Step by the Internal Heavy Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature and based on mechanistic understanding, we designed deazaflavins (dFl) with reducing powers comparable to Li which function via the consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) mechanism independently on molecular oxygen. The internal heavy atom effect (IHAE) by introducing bromine into the photocatalyst enhances considerably the key triplet pathway via a triplet&#8208;born radical pair. Furthermore, an optimal concentration of the sacrificial electron donor (Ssac) is required for bypassing the unproductive reaction via the singlet&#8208;born radical pair.







Abstract
Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting via a consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8211; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8211; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions via a three&#8208;component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100&#8201;% triplet yield but causes photo&#8208;instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5&#8208;phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo&#8208; and chloroarenes with electron&#8208;donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.

Bromine on the 5-phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo- and chloroarenes with electron-donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulated Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modulated strategy was developed for the synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated method, the modulated approach changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times.







Abstract
The weak interaction of covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles makes the preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films difficult. Herein, a modulated strategy for the facile synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness is reported. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated approach, the modulated strategy changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times. Moreover, self&#8208;standing LZU&#8208;8 film can be used as a membrane for efficient removal of 99&#8201;% mercury ions from aqueous solution. Our results open up a new approach to prepare self&#8208;standing COF thin films for practical applications.

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Iron&#8208;Containing MRI Contrast Agent Sensor for H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe(II) complex with the macrocyclic quinol&#8208;containing ligand H4qp4 displays high water&#8208; and air&#8208;stability. The complex rapidly reacts with H2O2, but not O2, to yield Fe(III) complexes with oxidized ligands that contain para&#8208;quinone groups. Upon oxidation by H2O2, the r1 increases by over four&#8208;fold, enabling the Fe(II) complex to act as an MRI contrast agent sensor for this reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H4qp4 reacts with H2O2 to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two para&#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the T1&#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H2O2 using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H2O2, in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.

         <title>Ammonia Borane, NH3BH3: A Threshold Photoelectron&#8211;Photoion Coincidence Study of a Potential Hydrogen&#8208;Storage Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The threshold photoelectron spectrum of ammonia borane NH3BH3 is reported. We determined an ionization energy of 9.26&#177;0.03&#8197;eV and observed a pronounced vibrational progression. In addition, the dissociation energy of the B&#8722;H bond was determined to be 419&#177;10&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The electronic situation of NH3BH3 is compared to its hydrocarbon analogue ethane.







Abstract
We have investigated the photoionization of ammonia borane (AB) and determined adiabatic ionization energy to be 9.26&#177;0.03&#8197;eV for the X+ 2E&#8592;X 1A1 transition. Although the threshold photoelectron spectrum appears at first glance to be similar to the one of the isosteric ethane, the electronic situation differs markedly, due to different orbital energies. In addition, an appearance energy AE0K(NH3BH3, NH3BH2+)= 10.00&#177;0.03&#8197;eV has been determined, corresponding to the loss of a hydrogen atom at the BH3&#8208;site. From the data, a 0&#8197;K bond dissociation energy for the B&#8722;H bond in the cation of 71.5&#177;3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was derived, whereas the one in the neutral compound has been estimated to be 419&#177;10&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination chemistry of palladium is poorly developed in nuclear medicine due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all the criteria required for an in&#8197;vivo application. By showing that the monopicolinate cyclam TE1PA is a highly relevant chelator for natural and radioactive Pd, we have opened avenues to enrich the area of palladium&#8208;based targeted radiotherapies. This cover represents the early stage of their expansion. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;H.&#8197;S. Driver, N. Le&#8197;Bris, R. Tripier, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200942).

         <title>A High&#8208;Valent Ru&#8208;PCP Pincer Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Carbonyl and Carboxyl Compounds under Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;valent metal complexes are viable candidates for hydrogenation catalysts: The domain of catalytic hydrogenation is traditionally dominated by low&#8208;valent metals; however, the heterolytic bond&#8208;splitting mechanism does not require an electron&#8208;rich metal. Here we report a structurally well&#8208;defined ruthenium(IV) catalyst capable of hydrogen activation at room temperature and the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen.

         <title>Radical Complexes of Nickel(II)/Copper(II) and Redox Non&#8208;innocent MB&#8208;DIPY Ligands: Unusual Stability and Strong Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption at &#955;max &#8764;1300&#8197;nm</title>

MB&#8208;DIPY&#8208;based stable radicals with redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm have been prepared and characterized by spectroscopic and theoretical methods. Stable radical complexes can be either oxidized to regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M=Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds within an &#8764;400&#8197;mV electrochemical window.







Abstract
The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. Here we report the preparation of a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the radical&#8208;anion state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at &#955;max&#8764;1300&#8197;nm and can be either oxidized to regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M=Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds. The radical nature of the stable [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)] complexes was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy with additional insight into their electronic structure obtained by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, electro&#8208; and spectroelectrochemistry, magnetic measurements, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electronic structures and spectroscopic properties of the radical&#8208;based chromophores were also probed by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. These nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes represent the first stable radical compounds with a MB&#8208;DIPY ligand.

         <title>Development of bacterial enzyme&#8208;based biosensor for the detection and quantification of selenate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enzymatic biosensor has been developed for the determination of selenate (SeO  4  2&#8208;  ), in which selenate reductase (SeR) is chemically attached to a gold disk electrode by lipoic acid N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester as linker, allowing the catalytic reduction of the SeO  4  2&#8208;  to SeO  3  2&#8208;  . Modification of the gold electrode has been characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements have been performed in different buffers for selenate determination. Under optimum condition, the calibration curve was linear in range 7.0&#8208;3900.0 &#181;g/L with a limit of detection and quantification 4.97 and 15.56 &#181;g/L, respectively. The interference of the relevant oxyanions: SO  4  2&#8722;  , NO  3  &#8208;  , NO  2  &#8208;  , PO  4  3&#8208;  and AsO  4  3&#8208;  has been studied on the determination of SeO  4  2&#8208;  . Finally, the enzyme&#8208;modified surface has been used for the determination of SeO  4  2&#8208;  in different real water samples with a recovery of 95.2&#8208;102.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Cross Electrophile Coupling of Benzyl Bromides and Sulfonium Salts towards the Synthesis of Dihydro Stilbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalysed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl sulfonium salts and benzyl bromides is reported. Simple, stable and readily available sulfonium salts have shown their ability as leaving groups in cross electrophile coupling, allowing the formation of challenging sp3&#8208;sp3 carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, towards the synthesis of interesting dihydro stilbene derivatives. In addition, benzyl tosyl derivatives have been demonstrated to be suitable substrates for the reductive cross&#8208;coupling via  in situ  formation of the corresponding sulfonium salt.</dc:description>

The bridging MeCN ligand in the dicopper(I) complex [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeCN)][X]2 (X=WCA) can easily be replaced by white phosphorus (P4) or yellow arsenic (As4) to yield [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E4)][X]2 (E=P, As). The coordinated intact E4 tetrahedra can be further selectively functionalized with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic alkyl amino carbenes (CAACs) under cleavage of E&#8722;E bonds, while using a small and strong NHC leads to the release of the pnictogen tetrahedra as P4 and grey arsenic, respectively.







Abstract
The bridging MeCN ligand in the dicopper(I) complexes [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeCN)][X]2 (X=weakly coordinating anion, NTf2 (1&#8201;a), FAl[OC6F10(C6F5)]3 (1&#8201;b), Al[OC(CF3)3]4 (1&#8201;c)) was replaced by white phosphorus (P4) or yellow arsenic (As4) to yield [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E4)][X]2 (E=P (2&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (3&#8201;a&#8211;c)). The molecular structures in the solid state reveal novel coordination modes for E4 tetrahedra bonded to coinage metal ions. Experimental data and quantum chemical computations provide information concerning perturbations to the bonding in coordinated E4 tetrahedra. Reactions with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) led to replacement of the E4 tetrahedra with release of P4 or As4 and formation of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeNHC)][X]2 (4&#8201;a,b) or to an opening of one E&#8722;E bond leading to an unusual E4 butterfly structural motif in [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;E4DippNHC)][X]2 (E=P (5&#8201;a,b), E=As (6)). With a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (EtCAAC), cleavage of two As&#8722;As bonds was observed to give two isomers of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;As4EtCAAC)][X]2 (7&#8201;a,b) with an unusual As4&#8208;triangle+1 unit.

         <title>Dynamic Stereochemistry of a Biphenyl&#8208;Bisprolineamide Model Catalyst and its Imidazolidinone Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;dependent dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bisprolineamide is characterized by VCD spectroscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in&#8197;situ VCD spectroscopy enables the determination of the imidazolidinones without extensive NMR analysis. In combination with NMR reaction monitoring, even the absolute configuration of a minor imidazolidinone species can be determined.







Abstract
In this study, we characterize the dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(proline amide) catalyst in chloroform and DMSO as representative weakly and strongly hydrogen bonding solvents. Using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) based spectra calculations, we show that the preferred axial stereochemistry of the catalyst is determined by solute&#8208;solvent interactions. Explicitly considering solvation with DMSO molecules is found to be essential to correctly predict the conformational preferences of the catalyst. Furthermore, we investigate the stereochemistry of the corresponding enamines and imidazolidinones that are formed upon reaction with isovaleraldehyde. The enamines are found to rapidly convert to endo&#8208;imidazolidinones and the thermodynamically favored exo&#8208;imidazolidinones are formed only slowly. The present study demonstrates that the stereochemistry of these imidazolidinones can be deduced directly from the VCD spectra analysis without any further detailed analysis of NMR spectra. Hence, we herein exemplify the use of VCD spectroscopy for an in&#8197;situ characterization of intermediates relevant in asymmetric catalysts.

Visualization of cation dynamics inside living systems represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1)&#8197;Red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and NIR channels; 2)&#8197;directing the sensors to various subcellular localizations; 3)&#8197;lowering the phototoxicity of sensors for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D physiology, in which biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.







Abstract
Visualization of cation dynamics inside a living system represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. Since the inception of BAPTA&#8208;based cellular calcium indicators in the 1980s, generations of chemical and genetically encoded ion indicators spanning the visible spectrum have been developed. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1.&#8197;red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) channels; 2.&#8197;directing the indicators to various subcellular localizations; 3.&#8197;lowering the phototoxicity of indicators for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D cellular physiology, where biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This outlook poses exciting challenges and opportunities for chemists to upgrade the toolkit of fluorescent indicators as key enablers for a new era of imageomics.

         <dc:description>
Reductive alkane elimination reacting the aryltin trihydride Ar*SnH3 with donor free alkyl complexes [Cp*2Ln(CH{SiMe3}2)] (Ln=Y, Lu) in the presence of diethyl methylamine gives access to Ln(III)&#8722;H&#8722;Sn(II) linkages. The respective germanium and lead entities can be generated via exchange of hydrido&#8208;bridged dimers [(Ar*EH)2] (E=Ge, Pb) and [(Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2] (Ln=Y, Lu). Lead derivatives [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2PbAr*] engage in H/D&#8208;exchange in benzene&#8208;d6 at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Following the alkane&#8208;elimination route, the reaction between tetravalent aryl tintrihydride Ar*SnH3 and trivalent rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metallocene alkyls [Cp*2Ln(CH{SiMe3}2)] gave complexes [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2SnAr*] implementing a low&#8208;valent tin hydride (Ln=Y, Lu; Ar*=2,6&#8208;Trip2C6H3, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl). The homologous complexes of germanium and lead, [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2EAr*] (E = Ge, Pb), were accessed via addition of low&#8208;valent [(Ar*EH)2] to the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal hydrides [(Cp*2LnH)2]. The lead compounds [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2PbAr*] exhibit H/D exchange in reactions with deuterated solvents or dihydrogen.

         <title>Six&#8208;Step Continuous Flow Synthesis of Diclofenac Sodium via Cascade Etherification/Smiles Rearrangement Strategy: Tackling the Issues of Batch Processing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from aniline and chloroacetic acid was developed by using a challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade as the key step in two types of flow reactors. The total isolated yield of diclofenac sodium was up to 63&#8201;% with an average yield of above 90&#8201;% for each step within a total residence time of 205&#8197;min.







Abstract
Diclofenac sodium is a widely used nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) as over&#8208;the&#8208;counter (OTC) medication for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Herein, the development of an intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from commercially available aniline and chloroacetic acid is described. A challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;phenylacetamide and 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenol into hydroxyacetyldiphenylamine operated with the precise control of reaction conditions in continuous flow was realized as the key step in this multistep synthetic chemistry. The undesired amide hydrolysis in Smiles rearrangement was addressed and the extra installation of N&#8208;chloroacetyl group in current industrial batch mode was avoided. Diclofenac sodium was obtained in 63&#8201;% isolated yield with an average yield of above 90&#8201;% for each step in a total residence time of 205&#8197;min.

         <title>The Use of Bridging Ligand Substituents to Bias the Population of Localized and Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valence Conformers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;valence complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]+ are known to exist as a mixture of conformations, with electronic character varying between the localized and delocalized limits in response to the particular mutual orientations of the metal and bridge fragments. Electronic structure calculations using the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with spectroelectrochemical studies have demonstrated that the conformational population, and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety.







Abstract
The electronic structure and associated spectroscopic properties of ligand&#8208;bridged, bimetallic &#8216;mixed&#8208;valence&#8217; complexes of the general form {M}(&#956;&#8208;B){M+} are dictated by the electronic couplings, and hence orbital overlaps, between the metal centers mediated by the bridge. In the case of complexes such as [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CC6H4C&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*}]+, the low barrier to rotation of the half&#8208;sandwich metal fragments and the arylene bridge around the acetylene moieties results in population of many energy minima across the conformational energy landscape. Since orbital overlap is also sensitive to the particular mutual orientations of the metal fragment(s) and arylene bridge through a Karplus&#8208;like relationship, the different members of the population range exemplify electronic structures ranging from strongly localized (weakly coupled Robin&#8208;Day Class II) to completely delocalized (Robin&#8208;Day Class III). Here, we use electronic structure calculations with the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and IR spectroelectrochemical studies to show that the conformational population in complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]+, and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety (Ar=1,4&#8208;C6H4, 1,4&#8208;C6F4, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;Me2, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;(CF3)2, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;iPr2).

The isothermal compression of a plane&#8208;square nickel(II) bis(N,N&#8208;diethyldithiocarbamate) complex above 1.23&#8197;GPa leads to a phase transition. The clearly visible strain in the transition between phases &#945; and &#948; is associated with the exchange of the anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interaction donor from methylene to the methyl group and with the significantly increased contribution of thioureide form II in the resonance electronic structure of ligands present in phase &#948;.







Abstract
The pressure&#8208;induced transformation of plane&#8208;square complex nickel(II) bis(N,N&#8208;diethyldithiocarbamate) between its soft dithiocarbamate (form I) and thioureide (form II) mesomeres is coupled to the interchange of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions from methylene to the methyl group, respectively. At 1.23&#8197;GPa, the clearly visible giant anomalous compressibility of the crystal reveals a potential&#8208;energy difference of 5.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between the two complex forms. The structural and spectroscopic results, which are supported by quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations, connect this solid&#8208;state phase transition with the mesomeric transition, and this is accompanied by the conformational transformation of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C rearrangement and formation of the charge&#8208;assisted S&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C bond under pressure.

&lt;p&gt;The pressure-induced transformation of plane-square complex nickel(II) bis(N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate) between its soft &lt;i&gt;dithiocarbamate&lt;/i&gt; (form I) and &lt;i&gt;thioureide&lt;/i&gt; (form II) mesomeres is coupled to the interchange of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions from methylene to the methyl group, respectively. At 1.23&#8197;GPa, the clearly visible giant anomalous compressibility of the crystal reveals a potential-energy difference of 5.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; between the two complex forms. The structural and spectroscopic results, which are supported by quantum-mechanical calculations, connect this solid-state phase transition with the mesomeric transition, and this is accompanied by the conformational transformation of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C rearrangement and formation of the charge-assisted S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C bond under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanosine and pterins are depicted as the constellation Gemini. Guanine nucleosides are one of the immortal survivors of prebiotic chemistry, becoming the focus of many prebiotic reactions. However, like Pollux from Greek mythology, guanosine would not have been born alone&#8212;pterins would have been formed in equal (or, in this case, even in major) parts through prebiotic reactions. Pterins, similar to Castor, would have been equally important for nascent biochemical reactions, paving the way to modern biochemistry. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Menor&#8208;Salv&#225;n, N.&#8197;V. Hud, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200714).

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant active sites, a class of materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands, is widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants.   However, the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers of MOFs extremely limits its photocatalytic degradation performance.  Herein, Ti  3  C  2  T  x  nanosheets&#8208;based  NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)  hybrids  with  Schottky&#8208;heterojunction  were fabricated by  in situ  hydrothermal  assembly for improved  photocatalytic  activity  .  The photodegradation efficiencies of NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti  3  C  2  T  x  (N&#8208;M/T) hybrids for phenol and chlorophenol were 96.36% and  99.83%  within 60 minutes, respectively.  The N&#8208;M/T  Schottky&#8208;heterojunction  duly transferred electrons to Ti  3  C  2  T  x  nanosheets surface via built&#8208;in electric fields, effectively suppressing the  recombination of  photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe). Moreover, the Fe&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence in the N&#8208;M/T led to improvement in the efficiency of the  in situ  generated  photo&#8208;Fenton  reactions, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity with more generated reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The study proposes a highly effective for removing phenolic pollutants in waste water.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, a practical and straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;( E )&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond activation was developed. The readily available and inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene (BTP), a non&#8208;ozone depleting reagent, was used as a reservoir of 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne. With this approach, the monofunctionalization of a panel of heteroarenes was possible in a safe and scalable manner (23 examples, up to 87% yield). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to get a better understanding of the mechanism of this transformation. These studies suggested that 1) a cyclometallated ruthenium complex enabled the transformation, 2) this latter exhibited high efficiency in this transformation compared to the commercially available [RuCl 2 ( p &#8208;cymene)] 2 and 3) the mechanism proceeded through a bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium intermediate for the carboruthenation step.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the formation of highly interpenetrated frameworks. An interesting observation is the presence of very large adamantane&#8208;shaped cages in a single network, making these crystals new entries in the collection of diamondoid&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The frameworks were constructed by assembling tetrahedral pyridine ligands and copper dichloride. Currently, the networks&#8217; degree of interpenetration is among the highest reported and increases when the size of the ligand is increased. Highly interpenetrated frameworks typically have low surface contact areas. In contrast, in our systems, the voids take up to 63% of the unit cell volume. The frameworks are chiral but formed from achiral components. The chirality is manifested by the coordination chemistry frameworks around the metal center, the structure of the helicoidal channels and the motifs of the individual networks. Channels of both handedness are present within the unit cells. This phenomenon shapes the walls of the channels, which are composed of 10, 16, or 32 chains correlated to the degree of interpenetration 10&#8208;, 16&#8208; and 32&#8208;fold. By changing the distance between the center of the ligand and the coordination moieties, we succeeded in tuning the diameter of the channels. Relatively large channels were formed, having diameters up to 31.0 &#197; &#215; 14.8 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;mediated Directional&#8208;capping of Rod&#8208;packing Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RPMOF) are constructed by regulating the&#160;in&#8208;situ formation of the capping agent. In CPM&#8208;s7, carboxylate linkers extend 1D manganese&#8208;oxide chains in four additional directions, forming 3D RPMOF. The substitution of Mn2+&#160;with a stronger Lewis acidic Co2+, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis&#8208;prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate&#8208;extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod&#8208;packing CPM&#8208;s8.&#160;Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagneric ordering of CPM&#8208;s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid, Highly Sensitive and Selective Phosgene Sensor Based on 5,6&#8208;Pinenepyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The toxicity of phosgene (COCl  2  ) combined with its extensive use as a reactant and building block in the chemical industry make its fast and accurate detection a prerequisite. We have developed a carboxylic derivative of 5,6&#8208;pinenepyridine which is able to act as colorimetric and fluorimetric sensor for phosgene in air and solution. For the first time, the formation of a pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;  a  ]isoindolone was used for this purpose. In solution, the sensing reaction is extremely fast (under 5 s), selective and highly sensitive, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.7 nM / 0.8 ppb. When fixed on a solid support, the sensor is able to detect the presence of gaseous phosgene down to concentrations of 0.1 ppm, one of the lowest values reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acylated nucleoside analogs play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogs. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct, protecting group free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, we report a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O &#8208; or N &#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid discrimination of bacterial drug resistivity by array based cross&#8208;validation using 2D&#8208;MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise discrimination of microbes based on family, class and drug resistivity is quintessential for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. Information about the type and strength of drug resistivity can help the analyst to prescribe the suitable antibiotic in proper dosage to completely eradicate microbes without giving them a chance to gain further resistance. Herein, we propose a sensor array based on the use of cationic two&#8208;dimensional MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s and green fluorescence protein (GFP) as building blocks. Cationic surfaces of receptors with various functionality were suitable for tunable interaction with anionic surfaces of microbes. The array successfully discriminates six different bacteria strains. The versatile ability of the receptors to bind with the wild type as well as their corresponding ampicillin resistant strain contributed significantly towards the rapid detection with high sensitivity. The optimized array was able to classify five different types and three different extent of drug resistant variants of &lt;italic&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/italic&gt; (EC) by using bacteria cells and lysates. Finally, we have introduced the cross identification method using both bacteria cells and lysates and we found a great enhancement of detection in sensitivity and accuracy. This is the first time we are reporting this approach which can be extended to many other methods for better accuracy in array based detection.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ preparation of CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 composite assisted with water as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite has triggered a lot of research due to its superior optical properties. However, halide perovskite materials have poor environmental stabilities and are easily affected by external factors such as water and heat, resulting in structural decomposion and performance failure. Contrary to this commonplace concept, here we find that CsPbBr  3  (CPB) can convert to CsPb  2  Br  5  (CP2B5) partially when meeting a small amount of water, and the CsPbBr  3  @CsPb  2  Br  5  (CPB@CP2B5) composite is synthesized by an in&#8208;situ method accordingly. The CPB@CP2B5 composite shows an enhanced catalytic performance compared with pure CPB, as well as a dramatically synergistic effect of photo and thermal for catalytic CO  2  hydrogenation. The CO production rate of CPB@CP2B5 is determined as 69 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  under light irradiation at 200 &#176;C, which is 156.8 and 43.4 times higher than that under pure photo (0.44 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) and pure thermal (1.59 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) condition, respectively. Meanwhile, the CPB@CP2B5 sample is also stable, which shows no significant decline in the catalytic activity during 5 cycles of repeated experiments. The probable mechanism is explored by utilizing a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations.</dc:description>
