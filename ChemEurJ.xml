         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11912-11918, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar biphenyl is a stable minimum on the quantum mechanical potential energy surface of the crystal. The lack of thermal disorder in the phase I at 100&#8197;K and the properties of the experimental and theoretical electron densities support this conclusion. The crystal packing is mostly determined by intra and intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonding, non&#8208;covalent 
 interactions and internal rotation of the biphenyl molecule.







Abstract
A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100&#8197;K were subjected to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average of two twisted configurations in a double&#8208;well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H and the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>

Avoiding fibrils: The cationic antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III stabilizes droplet condensates formed by &#945;&#8208;synuclein, thereby impeding their transformation to the fibrillar amyloid state.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as &#945;&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.

         <title>What Is the Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can It Be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11827-11836, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The QM/MM calculations of the demethylation of symmetrical dimethylated arginine (R3me2&#8197;s) substrate by KDM4E via C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H pathways show the preference for the former and application of external electric fields (EEFs) increases the rate of C&#8722;H activation, while inhibiting the rate of N&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Arginine methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Some Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent Jumonji&#8208;C (JmjC) N&#1013;&#8208;methyl lysine histone demethylases also have N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylase activity. We report combined molecular dynamic (MD) and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) studies on the mechanism of N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation by human KDM4E and compare the results with those reported for N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation by KDM4A. At the KDM4E active site, Glu191, Asn291, and Ser197 form a conserved scaffold that restricts substrate dynamics; substrate binding is also mediated by an out of active site hydrogen&#8208;bond between the substrate Ser1 and Tyr178. The calculations imply that in either C&#8722;H or N&#8722;H potential bond cleaving pathways for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation, electron transfer occurs via a &#963;&#8208;channel; the transition state for the N&#8722;H pathway is &#8764;10&#8197;kcal/mol higher than for the C&#8722;H pathway due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the N&#8722;H bond. The results of applying external electric fields (EEFs) reveal EEFs with positive field strengths parallel to the Fe=O bond have a significant barrier&#8208;lowering effect on the C&#8722;H pathway, by contrast, such EEFs inhibit the N&#8722;H activation rate. The overall results imply that KDM4 catalyzed N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation and N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation occur via similar C&#8722;H abstraction and rebound mechanisms leading to methyl group hydroxylation, though there are differences in the interactions leading to productive binding of intermediates.

N&#8722;H metallation routes: Interest in carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes of the coinage metals has inspired comprehensive efforts towards simplifying their synthesis. We now showcase simple and sustainable routes to various CMAs, using mild conditions for the N&#8722;H metallation of carbazole and other amines. The action of a mild base is studied computationally and the photophysical properties of some new CMA complexes are examined.







Abstract
The development of novel and operationally simple synthetic routes to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes of copper, silver and gold relevant for photonic applications are reported. A mild base and sustainable solvents allow all reactions to be conducted in air and at room temperature, leading to high yields of the targeted compounds even on multigram scales. The effect of various mild bases on the N&#8722;H metallation was studied in silico and experimentally, while a mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free synthetic approach was also developed. Our photophysical studies on [M(NHC)(Cbz)] (Cbz=carbazolyl) indicate that the occurrence of fluorescent or phosphorescent states is determined primarily by the metal, providing control over the excited state properties. Consequently, we demonstrate the potential of the new CMAs beyond luminescence applications by employing a selected CMA as a photocatalyst. The exemplified synthetic ease is expected to accelerate the applications of CMAs in photocatalysis and materials chemistry.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free Au(I) Catalysis Enabled by Bifunctional Urea&#8208; and Squaramide&#8208;Phosphine Ligands via H&#8208;Bonding</title>

Gold(I) chloride complexes with bifunctional phosphino(thio)urea and phosphinosquaramide ligands have been designed to be catalytically active in the absence of silver additives in intra&#8208; and intermolecular reactions of alkynes. Structure&#8208;activity relationships, DFT calculations focused on the Au&#8722;Cl bond activation, and comprehensive kinetic studies highlight the key role of the H&#8208;bond donor group in enabling catalysis at the Au(I) center.







Abstract
A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Electrophilic Fluorinating Reagents for Highly Selective Mono&#8208; and Difluorination of Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11919-11925, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents [N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) analogues] were synthesized by using F2 gas. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers. Reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination.







Abstract
Efficient methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds have been intensively studied, recently. Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is, difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base&#8208;free conditions. Thus, both mono&#8208; and difluorinated target materials were prepared from the same substrate.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11957-11965, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipid phase mediated photo&#8208;click cycloaddition between photo&#8208;generated nitrile imines and energy&#8208;storable dibenzo[c,g][1,2]diazocine (DBDA) was established, including optimized biocompatibility and highly spatiotemporal resolution as well. A supramolecular assembly of the photo&#8208;switchable DBDA monopeptides was also exploited to implant the DBDA moiety on live cell membranes for studying their dynamics via the photo&#8208;click reaction by using digital micromirror device (DMD) chip.







Abstract
A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;l&#8208;alanine (cis&#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on C&#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the cis&#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into trans&#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo&#8208;click reactions between the monopeptides and photo&#8208;generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.

Magic watchmaker. The Ir&#8208;NHC catalyst efficiently hydroalkenylates alkynes with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine. The interplay of the NHC and acac ligands drives the reaction via IrIII intermediates allowing the selective formation of expected and unexpected butadienylpyridine derivatives. The unusual 5&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;butadienylpyridines result from a complex stepwise mechanism involving quinolizine intermediates.







Abstract
Iridium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of formula Ir(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(IPr)(&#951;2&#8208;coe) [BHetA=bis&#8208;heteroatomic acidato, acetylacetonate or acetate; IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;carbene; coe=cyclooctene] have been prepared by treating Ir(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(&#951;2&#8208;coe)2 complexes with IPr. These complexes react with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine to afford the hydrido&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;alkenyl cyclometalated derivatives IrH(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(&#954;2N,C&#8208;C7H6N)(IPr) through the iridium(I) intermediate Ir(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(IPr)(&#951;2&#8208;C7H7N). The cyclometalated IrH(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;acac)(&#954;2N,C&#8211;C7H6N)(IPr) complex efficiently catalyzes the hydroalkenylation of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes and enynes with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine to afford 2&#8208;(4R&#8208;butadienyl)pyridines with Z,E configuration as the major reaction products (yield up to 89&#8201;%). In addition, unprecedented (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butadienyl&#8208;5R&#8208;pyridine derivatives have been obtained as minor reaction products (yield up to 21&#8201;%) from the elusive 1Z,3gem&#8208;butadienyl hydroalkenylation products. These compounds undergo a thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to afford bicyclic 4H&#8208;quinolizine derivatives that, under catalytic reaction conditions, tautomerize to 6H&#8208;quinolizine to afford the (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(butadienyl)&#8208;5R&#8208;pyridine by a retro&#8208;electrocyclization reaction.

         <title>Recyclable Supramolecular Assembly&#8208;Induced Emission System for Selective Detection and Efficient Removal of Mercury(II)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11879-11887, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular functional system with appreciable photoluminescent properties on the basis of the supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) mechanism is successfully constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions, which shows great potentials in simultaneously selective detection and efficient removal of Hg2+ from water owing to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complexes. This system also possesses excellent regeneration ability without the loss of adsorption activity.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for simultaneously detecting and removing Hg2+ from water is vital to address mercury pollution. Herein a supramolecular assembly G&#8834;H with photoluminescent properties is facilely constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of a functional pillar[5]arene bearing two N,N&#8208;dimethyldithiocarbamoyl binding sites (H) and an AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene derivative (G). Remarkably, the fluorescence of G&#8834;H can be exclusively quenched by Hg2+ among the 30 cations due to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complex and only L&#8208;cysteine can restore fluorescence in the common 20 amino acids. Meanwhile, the probe G&#8834;H has a considerable thermal and pH stability, a good anti&#8208;interference property from various cations, and a satisfactory sensitivity. More importantly, G&#8834;H exhibits a prominent capability of Hg2+ removal with rapid capture rate (within 1&#8197;h) and excellent adsorption efficiency (98&#8201;%), as well as a highly efficient recyclability without losing any adsorption activity.

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>

         <dc:description>
Robust defective nickel(II) pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the organic spacers have been explored for C2H2/CO2 separation. As proven by static and dynamic gas adsorption and computational modelling the non&#8208;defective34 systems give rise to selective interactions with C2H2 over CO2 as a result of a mixture of pore confinement and H&#8208;bonding and alkyne&#8208;alkyne interactions. Creation of defects is responsible for strong interactions of cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 with a concomitant lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
C2H2/CO2 separation is a highly challenging process as a consequence of their similar physicochemical properties. In this work we have explored, by static and dynamic gas sorption techniques and computational modelling, the suitability of a series of two isoreticular robust Ni(II)pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones, for C2H2/CO2 separation. The results are consistent with high adsorption capacity and selectivity of the essayed systems towards C2H2 molecules. Furthermore, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment with KOH ethanolic solution gives rise to linker vacancy defects and incorporation of extraframework potassium ions. Creation of defects is responsible for increased adsorption capacity for both gases, however, strong interactions of the cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 molecules are responsible for a lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.

         <title>Chiral Perylene Bisimide Dyes by Interlocked Arene Substituents in the Bay Area</title>

The interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motif of bay&#8208;tetraarylated perylene bisimides endows these molecules with chirality and rich conformational isomerism. These structural features are elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR. Optical spectroscopy including CD and CPL provide insights into their functional properties.







Abstract
A series of perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes bearing various aryl substituents in 1,6,7,12 bay positions has been synthesized by Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction. These molecules exhibit an exceptionally large and conformationally fixed twist angle of the PBI &#960;&#8208;core due to the high steric congestion imparted by the aryl substituents in bay positions. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of phenyl&#8208;, naphthyl&#8208; and pyrenyl&#8208;functionalized PBIs reveal interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motifs, leading to conformational chirality and the possibility for the isolation of enantiopure atropoisomers by semipreparative HPLC. The interlocked arrangement endows these molecules with substantial racemization barriers of about 120&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the tetraphenyl&#8208; and tetra&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, which is among the highest racemization barriers for axially chiral PBIs. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal the presence of a multitude of up to fourteen conformational isomers in solution that are interconverted via smaller activation barriers of about 65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The redox and optical properties of these core&#8208;twisted PBIs have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy and their respective atropo&#8208;enantiomers were further characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy.

1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes are versatile reagents in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. In this work the effect of guanidino group modification on the PCET reactivity is evaluated (X=H or OMe) and the best performing two compounds applied in intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular aryl&#8208;aryl coupling and oxidative lactonization test reactions. In difference to related reactions with high&#8208;potential benzoquinones, only a small amount of acid is required to inititiate efficient reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox&#8208;active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high&#8208;potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4&#8208;bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities is evaluated. The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized, and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed. Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramethoxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of N&#8208;ethylcarbazole to give N,N&#8217;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2&#8208;[(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)methyl]&#8208;benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high&#8208;potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.

Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl-aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;-4,4&#8217;&#8217;-tetramethoxy-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylcarbazole to give &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-diethyl-3,3&#8217;-bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2-[(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high-potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (Di)Azatricyclododecene Scaffold and Its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>

Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffolds have the potential to provide unique bioactivity, which cannot be achieved by conventional flat aromatic ring&#8208;based compounds. (Di)Azatricyclododecene scaffold with a bridged tricyclic system was developed and applied to design peptidomimetics with a 3D scaffold. The designed peptidomimetics showed inhibition of HIF transcription activity and antiviral activity toward rabies virus, both of which &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mediated interaction play a pivotal role.







Abstract
A novel sp3 carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. Tricyclic framework 7 was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one (11) via a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor 12&#8201;b&#8211;e was the key to forming 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized product 7 with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework 7, a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a, which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics 21&#8201;a&#8211;u were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold 8&#8201;a. Compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;h were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z=Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy, and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound 21&#8201;a showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC50=4.1&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;M), whereas compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;g showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 4.2&#8211;12.4&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.

         <title>Switching from Metal&#8208; to Ligand&#8208;Based Oxidation in Cobalt Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Bisguanidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11852-11867, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of the methyl groups of acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands in a cobalt(II) complex with a redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand by trifluoromethyl groups (hfacac co&#8208;ligands) changes the redox properties. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands is metal centered (Co(II)&#8594;Co(III)). By contrast, a radical monocationic bisguanidine ligand is formed upon one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes with hfacac co&#8208;ligands. The changes are accompanied by distinct changes in the magnetic and optical properties.







Abstract
The control of the redox reactivity, magnetic and optical properties of the different redox states of complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands permits their rational use in catalysis and materials science. The redox&#8208;chemistry of octahedrally coordinated high&#8208;spin CoII complexes (three unpaired electrons) with one redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and two acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands is completely changed by replacing the acac by hexafluoro&#8208;acetylacetonato (hfacac) co&#8208;ligands. The first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centered in the case of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands, giving diamagnetic CoIII complexes. By contrast, in the case of the less Lewis&#8208;basic hfacac co&#8208;ligands, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation becomes ligand&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand unit (four unpaired electrons). Ferromagnetic coupling between the spins on the metal and the organic radical in solution is evidenced by temperature&#8208;dependent paramagnetic NMR studies, allowing to estimate the isotropic exchange coupling constant in solution. Second one&#8208;electron oxidation leads to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with dicationic guanidine ligand units (three unpaired electrons) in the presence of hfacac co&#8208;ligands, but to low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with radical monocationic, peralkylated guanidine ligand (one unpaired electron) in the presence of acac co&#8208;ligands. The analysis of the electronic structures is complemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the spin density distributions and relative energies of the possible redox isomers.

Fluorine effect in olefin polymerization: Fluorine substituents at various positions (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) and with different numbers (n=0, 1, 2, 3, and 5) have been systematically studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomer, which show great influence on catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer.







Abstract
Fluorine substituents in transition metal catalysts are of great importance in olefin polymerization catalysis; however, the comprehensive effect of fluorine substituents is elusive in seminal late transition metal &#945;&#8208;diimine catalytic system. In this contribution, fluorine substituents at various positions (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;F) and with different numbers (Fn; n=0, 1, 2, 3, 5) were installed into the well&#8208;defined N&#8208;terphenyl amine and thus were studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomers. The position of the fluorine substituent was particularly crucial in these polymerization reactions in terms of catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer, and thus a picture on the fluorine effect was given. As a notable result, the ortho&#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalyst produced highly linear polyethylenes with an extremely high molecular weight (Mw=8703&#8197;kDa) and a significantly low degree of branching of 1.4/1000&#8197;C; however, the meta&#8208;F and/or para&#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts generated highly branched (up to 80.2/1000&#8197;C) polyethylenes with significantly low molecular weights (Mw=20&#8208;50&#8197;kDa).

In silico screening and experimental verification: A mesoionic imidazolylidene ligand with a diphenyltriazinyl substituent in C2 position (Dpt&#8208;MIC) was found to be a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor when compared to the standard N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IDipp or to a mesoionic carbene with a phenyl group in C2 position (Ph&#8208;MIC). The utility of the new carbene Dpt&#8208;MIC was evidenced by the synthesis of a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin compound.







Abstract
Mesoionic imidazolylidenes are recognized as excellent electron&#8208;donating ligands in organometallic and main group chemistry. However, these carbene ligands typically show poor &#960;&#8208;accepting properties. A computational analysis of 71 mesoionic imidazolylidenes that bear different aryl or heteroaryl substituents in C2 position was performed. The study has revealed that a diphenyltriazinyl (Dpt) substituent renders the corresponding carbene particularly &#960;&#8208;acidic. The computational results could be corroborated experimentally. A mesoionic imidazolylidene with a Dpt substituent was found to be a better &#963;&#8208;donor and a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor compared to an Arduengo&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. To demonstrate the utility of the new carbene, the ligand was used to stabilize a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin compound.

         <title>Bonding in Barium Boryloxides, Siloxides, Phenoxides and Silazides: A Comparison with the Lighter Alkaline Earths</title>

Barium and related alkaline&#8208;earth complexes bearing combinations of boryloxides, siloxides, phenoxides and amides have been structurally authenticated. Their structural patterns and bonding properties have been thoroughly investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Barium complexes ligated by bulky boryloxides [OBR2]&#8722; (where R=CH(SiMe3)2, 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2 or 2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3&#8208;C6H2), siloxide [OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;, and/or phenoxide [O&#8208;2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3]&#8722;, have been prepared. A diversity of coordination patterns is observed in the solid state for both homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes, with coordination numbers ranging between 2 and 4. The identity of the bridging ligand in heteroleptic dimers [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)]2 depends largely on the given pair of ligands X1 and X2. Experimentally, the propensity to fill the bridging position increases according to [OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]&#8722;&lt;[N(SiMe3)2]&#8722;&lt;[OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;&lt;[O(2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3)]&#8722;&lt;[OB(2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2)2]&#8722;. This trend is the overall expression of 3 properties: steric constraints, electronic density and &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donating capability of the negatively charged atom, and ability to generate Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;F, Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C(&#960;) or Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;H&#8722;C secondary interactions. The comparison of the structural motifs in the complexes [Ae{&#956;2&#8208;N(SiMe3)2}(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]2 (Ae = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) suggest that these observations may be extended to all alkaline earths. DFT calculations highlight the largely prevailing ionic character of ligand&#8208;Ae bonding in all compounds. The ionic character of the Ae&#8208;ligand bond encourages bridging coordination, whereas the number of bridging ligands is controlled by steric factors. DFT computations also indicate that in [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)]2 heteroleptic dimers, ligand predilection for bridging vs. terminal positions is dictated by the ability to establish secondary interactions between the metals and the ligands.

         <title>Early Oxidative Transformations During the Biosynthesis of Terrein and Related Natural Products</title>

         <dc:description>
Heterologous expression of two related biosynthetic gene clusters from Aspergillus terreus and Roussoella sp. DLM33 confirmed a conserved flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase that initiates the oxidative decarboxylation of the key intermediate (dichloro&#8208;) 6&#8208;hydroxymellein. Further in&#8197;vitro studies imply that both pathways diverge after this initial oxidation, whereas additional dehydration appears essential for downstream processing.







Abstract
The mycotoxin terrein is derived from the C10&#8208;precursor 6&#8208;hydroxymellein (6&#8208;HM) via an oxidative ring contraction. Although the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) has been identified, details of the enzymatic oxidative transformations are lacking. Combining heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro studies we show that the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase (FMO) TerC catalyzes the initial oxidative decarboxylation of 6&#8208;HM. The reactive intermediate is further hydroxylated by the second FMO TerD to yield a highly oxygenated aromatic species, but further reconstitution of the pathway was hampered. A related BGC was identified in the marine&#8208;derived Roussoella sp. DLM33 and confirmed by heterologous expression. These studies demonstrate that the biosynthetic pathways of terrein and related (polychlorinated) congeners diverge after oxidative decarboxylation of the lactone precursor that is catalyzed by a conserved FMO and further indicate that early dehydration of the side chain is an essential step.

Studies on the reactivity of 1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene towards rhodium(I) complexes revealed versatile reaction pathways, such as coordination, C&#8722;F and C&#8722;H bond activation steps. Fluorido ligands play a key role for the reactivity pattern observed.







Abstract
The reaction of the rhodium(I) complexes [Rh(E)(PEt3)3] (E=GePh3 (1), H (6), F (7)) with 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene afforded the defluorinative germylation products Z/E&#8208;2&#8208;(triphenylgermyl)&#8208;1,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene and the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)2] (2) together with the fluorophosphorane E&#8208;(CF3)CH=CF(PFEt3). For [Rh(Si(OEt)3)(PEt3)3] (4) the coordination of the fluoroolefin was found to give [Rh{Si(OEt)3}(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)2] (5). Two equivalents of complex 2 reacted further by C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition to yield [Rh(CF=CHCF3)(PEt3)2(&#956;&#8208;F)3Rh(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)] (9). The role of the fluorido ligand on the reactivity of complex 2 was assessed by comparison with the analogous chlorido complex. The use of complexes 1, 4 and 6 as catalysts for the derivatization of 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene provided products, which were generated by hydrodefluorination, hydrometallation and germylation reactions.

For [Rh(Si(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(PEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) the coordination of the fluoroolefin was found to give [Rh{Si(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(PEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). Two equivalents of complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; reacted further by C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition to yield [Rh(CF=CHCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(PEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-F)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rh(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(PEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;). The role of the fluorido ligand on the reactivity of complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was assessed by comparison with the analogous chlorido complex. The use of complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; as catalysts for the derivatization of 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropene provided products, which were generated by hydrodefluorination, hydrometallation and germylation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
As a consequence of specific interactions between acetylene molecules and alkyne, aromatic and hydroxide residues of metal clusters, two isoreticular nickel(II) pyrazolate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones are suitable for the selective separation of the challenging acetylene over CO2 gas mixture. Moreover, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment of these materials with ethanolic KOH solution gives rise to linker vacancy defects and the incorporation of extra&#8208;framework potassium ions, which are responsible for a further modulation of the interactions with the adsorbate molecules. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A.&#8197;R. Navarro et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100821).

         <title>Cover Feature: Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III (Chem. Eur. J. 46/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation plus the droplet formation of proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, but there is also evidence linking it to a variety of medical conditions. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via such droplet condensation. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, stabilizing the droplet phase and preventing conversion to the toxic fibrillar state. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Oliva, R. Winter, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101592).

Profound pharmacological benefits can be provided by site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group, which can be considered an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review highlights site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylation strategies according to the trideuteromethylation reagent used and describes the mechanism and scope of the reactions. As such, this review aims to be a guide for researchers, offering them the available C&#8722;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs or materials. For more details see the Review by M. Rueping et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;11751&#8197;ff.

         <title>Front Cover: What Is the Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can It Be Influenced by an External Electric Field? (Chem. Eur. J. 46/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
Methylation of arginine residues in histones is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation, and its dysregulation results in human diseases such as cancer and brain disorders. This study reveals the catalytic mechanism of the demethylation of methylated arginine R3 in H4 histone by a non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone demethylase 4E (KDM4E). Applying QM/MM and MD, we explored both C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H activations pathways. Importantly, the study revealed that by applying external electric fields (EEFs), we can modulate the C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H selectivities. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Z. Christov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101174).

         <title>Cover Feature: Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers (Chem. Eur. J. 46/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11748-11748, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphtha was separated by using a easily attainable metal&#8211;organic framework, Co3(HCOO)6, through selective molecular exclusion of alkane isomers with different degrees of branching. The separation capability of the compound was evaluated by using naphtha mixtures with 180+ hydrocarbon components. Co3(HCOO)6 exhibited efficient separation of the mixture and thus yielded products with high octane ratings and high dynamic capacity. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Wang, Q. Gong, J. Li, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101871).

Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of biocatalytic methods in organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes the developments in the current state of the art for practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles, drawing special attention to case studies that have been performed on preparative scale.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation pioneered by Heck in 1969 has dominated medicinal chemistry development for the ensuing fifty years. As the demand for more complex three&#8208;dimensional active pharmaceuticals continues to increase, preparative enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, by virtue of its exquisite selectivity and sustainable nature, is poised to provide a practical and affordable alternative for accessing such compounds. In this minireview, we summarize recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles. When appropriate, background information on the enzymatic transformation is provided and challenges and/or limitations are also highlighted.

&#8220;3 D&#8221; drug development: The deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group is attracting increased interest in pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we discuss the currently available methods for C&#8722;CD3 bond forming reactions and classify them according to the trideuteromethylation reagent. The mechanisms, scope and limitations of each method are considered in order to provide a guide for targeted trideutermethylation.







Abstract
In the field of medicinal chemistry, the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever&#8208;increasing attention. Site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylation of carbon atoms. In addition to CD3, the selective introduction of CD2H and CDH2 groups is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8722;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.

         <title>Porous Anionic Co(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework, with a High Density of Amino Groups, as a Superior Luminescent Sensor for Turn&#8208;on Al(III) Detection</title>

Al3+ sensor: A 3D porous anionic MOF displays superior turn&#8208;on sensing for Al(III) ions with ultralow sensitivity resulted from stronger interactions with free amines by employing strategic design principle. The detection approach is simple, fast, portable and economic as demonstrated by MOF filter paper tests for naked eye observation.







Abstract
Accumulation of high concentrations of Al(III) in body has a direct impact on health and therefore, the trace detection of Al(III) has been a matter for substantial concern. An anionic metal organic framework ({[Me2NH2]0.5[Co(DATRz)0.5(NH2BDC)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xG}n; 1; HDATRz=3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H2NH2&#8208;BDC=2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid, G=guest molecule) composed of two types of secondary building units (SBU) and channels of varying sizes was synthesized by employing a rational design mixed ligand synthesis approach. Free &#8722;NH2 groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn&#8208;on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter&#8208;ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement. The observed limit of detection is as low as 17.5&#8197;ppb, which is the lowest among the MOF&#8208;based sensors achieved so far. To make this detection approach simple, portable and economic, we demonstrate MOF filter paper test for real time naked eye observation.

An anionic metal organic framework ({[Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;[Co(DATRz)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xG}&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; HDATRz=3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-BDC=2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, G=guest molecule) composed of two types of secondary building units (SBU) and channels of varying sizes was synthesized by employing a rational design mixed ligand synthesis approach. Free &#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn-on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter-ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement. The observed limit of detection is as low as 17.5&#8197;ppb, which is the lowest among the MOF-based sensors achieved so far. To make this detection approach simple, portable and economic, we demonstrate MOF filter paper test for real time naked eye observation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 46, Page 11795-11798, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time for an upgrade: The separation of alkane isomers is investigated on a simple, easily available metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Co3(HCOO)6. The compound is capable of splitting monobranched and dibranched alkanes through selective molecular exclusion. In addition, the material exhibits excellent separation of naphtha, outperforming benchmark zeolites and MOFs, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation and RON upgrading.







Abstract
The separation of alkanes, particularly monobranched and dibranched isomers, is of paramount importance in the petrochemical industry for optimizing the feedstock of ethylene production as well as for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Here, we report the full separation of linear/monobranched alkanes from their dibranched isomers by a robust and easily scalable metal&#8208;organic framework material, Co3(HCOO)6. The compound completely excludes dibranched alkanes but adsorbs their linear and monobranched isomers, as evidenced by single&#8208;component and multicomponent adsorption measurements. More importantly, the material exhibits excellent performance in separating naphtha and is capable of providing high quality feedstock for the production of ethylene and gasoline components with high octane number, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation in petrochemical industry.

Go with the flow: The photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using the [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 catalyst under blue LEDs irradiation is reported. A large panel of alkenes and alkynes was functionalized in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, the photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous flow conditions is described. By using 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the developed [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 under blue LEDs irradiation, a large panel of alkenes and alkynes was hydrosilylated in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance. The mechanism of the reaction was studied, and a plausible scenario was suggested.

         <title>Tracking the Electrocatalytic Activity of a Single Palladium Nanoparticle for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

Stochastic collision model: A carbon ultramicroelectrode (C&#8208;UME) is used to obtain a 2&#8211;5 orders magnitude enhancement of maximum turnover frequency (kcat) by stochastic collision electrochemistry compared with the ensemble electrochemistry. The electrocatalytic activity of nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts is directly related to their working conditions, and the electrocatalytic heterogeneity among palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) could be displayed by stochastic collision electrochemistry.







Abstract
The nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#8217; performance is directly related to their working conditions. In general, a number of nanoparticles are uncontrollably fixed on a millimetre&#8208;sized electrode for electrochemical measurements. However, it is hard to reveal the maximum electrocatalytic activity owing to the aggregation and detachment of nanoparticles on the electrode surface. To solve this problem, here, we take the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) as a model system to track the electrocatalytic activity of single Pd NPs by stochastic collision electrochemistry and ensemble electrochemistry, respectively. Compared with the nanoparticle fixed working condition, Pd NPs in the nanoparticle diffused working condition results in a 2&#8211;5 orders magnitude enhancement of electrocatalytic activity for HER at various bias potential. Stochastic collision electrochemistry with high temporal resolution gives further insights into the accurate study of NPs&#8217; electrocatalytic performance, enabling to dramatically enhance electrocatalytic efficiency.

Two novel binuclear PCTA2 and AAZTA2 ligands were synthesized with a multistep process. Their GdIII&#8208;complexes results in molecular relaxivities at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K of ca. 24&#8211;25&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 thanks to the rigidity and compactness of the ligands. These values are remarkably higher that those found for the corresponding mononuclear complexes.







Abstract
The first binuclear Gd&#8208;complex of the 12&#8208;membered pyridine&#8208;based polyaminocarboxylate macrocyclic ligand PCTA was synthesized by C&#8722;C connection of the pyridine units through two different synthetic procedures. A dimeric AAZTA&#8208;ligand was also synthesized with the aim to compare the relaxometric results or the two ditopic Gd&#8208;complexes. Thus, the 1H relaxometric study on [Gd2PCTA2(H2O)4] and on [Gd2AAZTA2(H2O)4]2&#8722; highlighted the remarkable rigidity and compactness of the two binuclear complexes, which results in molar relaxivities (per Gd), at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K of ca. 12&#8211;12.6&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with an increase of ca. 80&#8201;% at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K (+70&#8201;% at 310&#8197;K) with respect to the corresponding mononuclear complexes.

         <title>Ca[B8O11(OH)4]:Eu2+&#8722;a Highly Efficient Deep Blue&#8208;emitting Phosphor Prepared by Low&#8208;temperature Self&#8208;reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B  8  O11(OH)  4  ]:Eu  2+  (CBH:Eu  2+  ). The crystal structure, morphology, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence (PL) properties of CBH:Eu  2+  phosphor have been investigated. By using a screened hybrid functional (HSE06), the calculated band gap (  E  g  ) of CBH was 7.48 eV. The results shows that almost all the added raw materials of Eu  3+  can be reduced to Eu  2+  in CBH crystal with a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH:Eu  2+  phosphor show broad excitation spectrum in the range of 220 to 400 nm, and narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428 nm in the range of 400 to 500 nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35 nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH: 2%Eu  2+  exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0%) and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6%). The PL intensity of CBH: 2%Eu  2+  remained 62.6% of the initial intensity at 150  o  C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH:2%Eu  2+  , excited by a 365 nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825 K. The above results show that CBH:Eu  2+  might be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to develop and design new type high&#8208;efficiency phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, we prepared molecular crystals containing a cationic amphiphile having azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from Systems Chemistry viewpoint.</dc:description>

         <title>Galactose Grafted Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets as a Scaffold for the In&#8208;situ Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles: A Potential Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8208;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8208;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines through Aryne Three&#8208;Component Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into position: Aryne multicomponent coupling triggered by pyridines allows the broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines bearing a &#8722;CF3 group by engaging &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be used as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway.







Abstract
The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol by using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated. The reaction allowed a broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives bearing the &#8722;CF3 group in good yields with &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway. Nucleophilic attack by the initially generated pyridylidene intermediate on the carbonyl followed by an SNAr process resembling the Smiles rearrangement affords the desired products.

Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2-di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway. Nucleophilic attack by the initially generated pyridylidene intermediate on the carbonyl followed by an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar process resembling the Smiles rearrangement affords the desired products.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Adjustable Cleft Based on an 8&#8208;sulfonamide&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic Acid with Oxyanion Hole Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cleft type receptors showing the oxyanion hole motif have been prepared in a straightforward synthesis starting from the commercial 3,7&#8208;dihidroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic acid. The double H&#8208;bond donor pattern is achieved by the introduction of a sulfonamide group in the C&#8208;8 position of naphthalene and a carboxamide at the C&#8208;2 position. This cleft, whose geometry resembles that of an oxyanion hole, is able to adjust to different guests, as shown by the analysis of the X&#8208; ray crystal structures of associates with methanol or acetic acid. Combination of hydrogen bonds and charge&#8208;transfer interactions led to further stabilization of the complexes, in which the electron&#8208;rich aromatic ring of the receptor was close in space to the electron&#8208;deficient dinitroaromatic guests. Modelling studies and bidimensional NMR experiments have been carried out to provide additional information.</dc:description>

New gallate&#8208;TAAILs (imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids) containing the weakly coordinating tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate anion, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8208;, are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications. Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) in combination with different alkyl chain lengths from 1&#8211;12 carbon atoms were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Contrary to the gallate&#8208;TAAIls, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability.







Abstract
We synthesized new imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) with the weakly coordinating tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate anion, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722;. Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) were combined with varying alkyl chain lengths at the imidazolium core leading to TAAILs, which were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity, and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Remarkable low viscosities of 29 cP at 25&#8201;&#176;C for [BMIM][Ga(C2F5)4] were achieved. However, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability, releasing pentafluoroethane at a voltage of 1.5&#8197;V. The 2&#8208;Me&#8208;substituted gallate&#8208;TAAILs slowly decompose over several weeks, whereas all other gallate&#8208;TAAILs showed no decomposition at all. With electrochemical windows of up to 5.15&#8197;V and low viscosities in a range of 66&#8211;162&#8197;cP, the gallate&#8208;TAAILs are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are capable to generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation with green light only, when bound to polynucleotides by intercalation, whereas they slowly decompose when irradiated in water showing poor sensitization activity. Enhanced sensitization activity is observed upon interaction with AT but not GC base pairs. This makes them interesting for applications, where singlet oxygen has to be generated with local control.







Abstract
There is an ongoing interest in 1O2 sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes 2&#8201;o&#8211;p and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for 1O2. In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA 1O2 is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of 2&#8201;o&#8211;p with DNA were investigated by thermal DNA melting studies, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and linear and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer 2&#8201;o in poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of 1O2 was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of 1O2 quenchers. When bound to poly(dG&#8201;:&#8201;dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers 2&#8201;o and 2&#8201;m, namely the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical 1O2 generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.

         <dc:description>
In the metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8211;&#948;Ge136, a Ge framework forms 20&#8208; and 28&#8208;atom cages (drawn with gray and bluish faces) hosting the Na guest atoms. The stopwatch hands give the actual number of Na atoms found per unit cell. In type&#8208;II clathrates, the guest atoms arrange with hierarchical relation to the C15 Laves phase and the oxygen partial structure of &#946;&#8208;Cristobalite. The latter is shown by white lines between Na atoms, turning red where only this partial structure is drawn. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. B&#246;hme et&#8197;al.

Plus 2: C2 insertion into well&#8208;known electron&#8208;donating carbazole unit brought about a drastic change in the physicochemical properties of dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;core twisted donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triad compounds. The slight structural modification at the donor unit led to a thermodynamic preference for quasi&#8208;axial conformations, dual emission comprising room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation, and unique electrochemical behavior.







Abstract
Novel electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) compounds comprising dibenzo[a,j]phenazine as the central acceptor core and two 7&#8208;membered diarylamines (iminodibenzyl and iminostilbene) as the donors have been designed and synthesized. Investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C2 insertion into well&#8208;known carbazole electron donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;core D&#8208;A&#8208;D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, electrochemical analysis suggested sigma&#8208;dimer formation and electrochemical polymerization on the electrode. Quantum chemical calculations also rationalized the experimental results.

         <title>Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent lithium storage was achieved by the double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C nanocomposites. The outermost N&#8722;C shell can improve the electronic conductivity and promote the dispersion of PMo12 clusters. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can benefit a faster lithium&#8208;ion kinetics by shorten lithium&#8208;ion diffusion path and buffer volume expansion during lithiation/delithiation process. And PMo12, as an electron sponge, can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and accelerate electron transfer of the composite.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based materials, with high theoretical capacities and abundant reversible multi&#8208;electron redox properties, are considered as promising candidates in lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the poor electronic conductivity, low specific surface area and high solubility in the electrolyte limited their practical applications. Herein, a double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C nanofiber (PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C, where PMo12 is [PMo12O40]3&#8722;, N&#8722;C is nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) was fabricated for the first time by combining coaxial electrospinning technique, thermal treatment and electrostatic adsorption. As an anode material for LIBs, the PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C delivered an excellent specific capacity of 1641&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles under 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The excellent electrochemical performance benefited from the unique double&#8208;shelled hollow structure of the material, in which the outermost N&#8722;C shell cannot only hinder the agglomeration of PMo12, but also improve its electronic conductivity. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion and accelerate Li+ diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. Moreover, PMo12 can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and facilitate electron transfer of the entire composites, as evidenced by the EIS kinetics study and lithium&#8208;ion diffusion analysis. This work paves the way for the fabrication of novel POM&#8208;based LIBs anode materials with excellent lithium storage performance.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Emissive Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0), and Tungsten(0) Complexes in the Solid State at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents emissive Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual visible and NIRII emission at room temperature and represent a milestone in the design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR luminophores. The emissive excited states were characterized by luminescence lifetime investigations and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) via Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value at room temperature. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Gerhards, B. Sarkar et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102208).

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles More Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The very low basicity and nucleophilicity of the phosphorus donor in phosphinines can be drastically increased by introducing strongly &#963;&#8208;donating Me3Si substituents to the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle. The highest gas&#8208;phase basicity was found for 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine, which is even more basic in the gas phase than pyridine. This finding led to the first quantitative synthesis of a phosphinine selenide by treating red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102390).

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert on the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep in&#8208;fjord substitution is presented as a new tool to control the mechanical properties of expanded helicenes. The syntheses of a series of these compounds containing internal inserts is described and their overall inversion profile is calculated. Interestingly, the interplay between steric and dispersion interactions play a major role in shape of the inversion profiles (energies, number of transition states and intermediates).







Abstract
A series of expanded helicenes of different sizes and shapes incorporating phenyl&#8208; and biphenyl&#8208;substituents at the deepest part of their fjord have been synthesized via sequential Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of appropriately designed diynes, and their racemization barriers have been calculated employing electronic structure methods. These show that the overall profile of the inversions (energies, number of transition states and intermediates, and their relative position) is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions. Hence, in&#8208;fjord substitution constitutes an additional tool to handle the mechanical properties in helicenes of uncommonly large diameter. The photochemical characterization of the newly prepared helical structures is also reported.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Amines via Mild and Selective sp3 C&#8211;H Imination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct replacement of sp3 C&#8208;H bonds with simple amine units (&#8208;NH2) remains synthetically challenging, although primary aliphatic amines are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. We report a mild and selective protocol for preparing primary and secondary aliphatic amines in a single pot, based on intermolecular sp3 C&#8208;H imination. The first C&#8208;H imination of diverse alkanes, this method shows useful site&#8208;selectivity within substrates bearing multiple sp3 C&#8208;H bonds. Furthermore, this reaction tolerates polar functional groups relevant for complex molecule synthesis, highlighted in the synthesis of amine pharmaceuticals and amination of natural products. We characterize a unique C&#8208;H imination mechanism based on radical rebound to an iminyl radical, supported by kinetic isotope effects, stereoablation, resubmission, and computational modeling. This work constitutes a selective method for complex amine synthesis and a new mechanistic platform for C&#8208;H amination.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective One&#8208;Pot Syntheses of Mixed Silicon&#8208;Germanium Heteroadamantane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Si x Ge y alloys are emerging materials for modern semiconductor technology. Well&#8208;defined model systems of the bulk structures aid in understanding their intrinsic characteristics. Three such model clusters have now been realized in the form of the Si x Ge y heteroadamantanes [0] , [1] , and [2] via selective one&#8208;pot syntheses starting from Me 2 GeCl 2 , Si 2 Cl 6 , and [nBu 4 N]Cl. Compound [0] contains 6 GeMe 2 and 4 SiSiCl 3 vertices, while one and two of the GeMe 2 groups are replaced by SiCl 2 moieties in compounds [1] and [2] , respectively. Chloride ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement quantitatively converts [2] into [1] at room temperature and finally into [0] at 60 &#176;C, which is not only remarkable in view of the rigidity of these cage structures but also sheds light on the assembly mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific On&#8208;Surface Cyclodehydrogenation of Bishelicenes: Preservation of Handedness from Helical to Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation of bispentahelicene on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy. Deposition of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bispentahelicene onto a gold surface in ultrahigh vacuum leads exclusively to formation of the homochiral (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208; diastereomers. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds then enantiospecifically into planar coronocoronene that breaks mirror symmetry due to surface confinement. Upon cooling, the coronocoronene enantiomers crystallize into a two&#8208;dimensional conglomerate of homochiral domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomerization of Functionalized Olefins Using the Dinuclear Catalyst [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2: A Mechanistic Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a combined experimental and computational study, the isomerization activity of the dinuclear palladium(I) complex [Pd  I  (  &#956;  &#8208;Br)(P  t  Bu  3  )]  2  towards allyl arenes, esters, amides, ethers, and alcohols has been investigated. The calculated energy profiles for catalyst activation, for two alternative dinuclear and mononuclear catalytic cycles, and for catalyst deactivation are in good agreement with the experimental results. The comparison of experimentally observed  E  /  Z  ratios at incomplete conversion with the calculated kinetic selectivities revealed that a substantial amount of product must form via the  dinuclear pathway  , in which the isomerization is promoted cooperatively by two palladium centers. The dissociation barrier towards mononuclear Pd species is relatively high, and once the catalyst enters the energetically more favorable  mononuclear pathway  , only a low barrier has to be overcome towards irreversible deactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine is an important intermediate in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imine and attracted great attentions. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based COF (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200 m 2 g &#8208;1 ), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300 nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.</dc:description>

High stretchability (more than 1000&#8201;%) and conductivity (0.67&#8197;S/m) emulsion gels were fabricated from emulsions and the introduction of glycerol endowed them with broad operating temperature (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The emulsion gel based strain sensors showed high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of full&#8208;range human motions.







Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical elasticity and conductivity are ideal materials in wearable devices. However, traditional hydrogels are fragile upon mechanical loading and lose functions in climate change because the internal water undergoes freeze and dehydration. Herein, we synthesize stable emulsions at high and low temperatures by introducing glycerol into the W/W emulsions. Then the high&#8208;stable emulsions are used as templates to produce the freestanding emulsion gels with enhanced mechanical strength and conductivity. The introduction of glycerol endows emulsions and emulsion gels with high and low temperature resistance (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The fabricated strain sensors based on emulsion gels show high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), high stretchability (1081&#8201;%), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of various human motions. These high&#8208;performance and eco&#8208;friendly emulsion gels can be promising candidates for next&#8208;generation artificial skin and human&#8208;machine interface.

         <title>A Chiral Molecular Cage Comprising Diethynylallenes and N&#8208;Heterotriangulenes for Enantioselective Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a match! A novel shape&#8208;persistent chiral cage constituting two N&#8208;heterotriangulene lids and three bis(diethynylallene) branches is reported, along with UV/vis complexation studies with both charged and neutral helicenes. Enantioselective discrimination was observed, which, in combination with the redox behavior of the host, makes the system appealing as a model for dual sensors with both chiral and electronic modulation.







Abstract
Chirality, a characteristic tool of molecular recognition in nature, is often a complement of redox active systems. Scientists, in their eagerness to mimic such sophistication, have designed numerous chiral systems based on molecular entities with cavities, such as macrocycles and cages. In an attempt to combine chirality and redox&#8208;active species, in this contribution we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of a chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage based on the combination of enantiopure diethynylallenes and electron&#8208;rich bridged triarylamines, also known as N&#8208;heterotriangulenes. Its ability for chiral recognition in solution was revealed through UV/vis titrations with enantiopure helicenes.

         <title>Modulating the Enantiodiscrimination Features of Inherently Chiral Selectors by Molecular Design: A HPLC and Voltammetry Study Case with Atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biindole&#8208;Based Monomers and Oligomer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold is studied in two enantiodiscrimination contests: as probes in enantioselective HPLC and as selectors in chiral voltammetry for successful discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid.







Abstract
A family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is studied in cascade in two enantioselection contexts. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.

ESKAPE kit: A novel engineered cyclotide has effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed high in vivo efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen known to produce chronic lung infection in humans. These findings suggest the possibility of designing novel therapeutics based on the cyclotide scaffold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Camarero et&#8197;al.

         <title>Hydrophobic Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks and Derived Composites for Microelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't rain on my parade: Hydrophobic metal&#8722;&#959;rganic frameworks (MOFs) and derived composites for microelectronics applications are highlighted. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chains and fluorinated linkers, doping with redox&#8208;active species, etc., to produce hydrophobic MOFs with improved dielectric and conductivity properties are discussed.







Abstract
The extraordinary characteristic features of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) make them applicable for use in a variety of fields but their conductivity in microelectronics over a wide relative humidity (RH) range has not been extensively explored. To achieve good performance, MOFs must be stable in water, i.&#8201;e., under humid conditions. However, the design of ultrastable hydrophobic MOFs with high conductivity for use in microelectronics as conducting and dielectric materials remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss applications of an emerging class of hydrophobic MOFs with respect to their use as active sensor coatings, tunable low&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and conductivity, which provide high&#8208;level roadmap for stimulating the next steps toward the development and implementation of hydrophobic MOFs for use in microelectronic devices. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chain and fluorinated linkers, doping of redox&#8208;active 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), the use of guest molecules, and conducting polymers or carbon materials in the pores or surface of MOFs have been utilized to produce hydrophobic MOFs. The contact angle of a water droplet and a coating can be used to evaluate the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of a MOF. These unique advantages enable hydrophobic MOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Classic representative examples of each category are discussed in terms of coordination structures, types of hydrophobic design, and potential microelectronic applications. Lastly, a summary and outlook as concluding remarks in this field are presented. We envision that future research in the area of hydrophobic MOFs promise to provide important breakthroughs in microelectronics applications.

         <title>Ready Access to Anhydrous Anionic Lanthanide Acetates by Using Imidazolium Acetate Ionic Liquids as the Reaction Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward pathway to synthesize anhydrous lanthanide acetate complexes from lanthanide chloride hydrates and the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) is described. The combination of the lanthanide size and the amount of IL introduced allows the selective formation of two isostructural crystalline anhydrous compounds the dimeric, [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], and the polymeric, [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n].







Abstract
Access to lanthanide acetate coordination compounds is challenged by the tendency of lanthanides to coordinate water and the plethora of acetate coordination modes. A straightforward, reproducible synthetic procedure by treating lanthanide chloride hydrates with defined ratios of the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) has been developed. This reaction pathway leads to two isostructural crystalline anhydrous coordination complexes, the polymeric [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n] and the dimeric [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], based on the ion size and the ratio of IL used.

Reaction with Eu and Tb resulted in a mixture of both polymeric and dimeric forms. When the amount of IL and/or the size of the cation was increased, the reaction led to only the dimeric compound for all the lanthanide series.

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;Imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on dicyano&#8208;imidazole with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been studied at Providence University (of which a building is shown). The efficiencies obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs. By combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent emission from sky blue to deep blue could be achieved. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8208;W. Lu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101807).

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising silver: The binary silver(I) halides, AgX, are well&#8208;known chemical species. In contrast, the only binary halide of silver(III) currently known is the fluoride AgF3. The CF3 group provides a suitable frame to stabilise silver(III) compounds with every halogen; these have been isolated and thoroughly characterised. Multistage unimolecular fragmentation experiments demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is surprisingly robust. The sobriety of silver thus perfectly matches the colourful variety of halogens. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Menj&#243;n et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101859).

         <title>Towards an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of variable unnatural base pair behavior&#8212;A biophysical analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The series of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) developed by the Romesberg lab which pair via hydrophobic and packing interactions have been replicated, transcribed, and translated inside of a living organism. However, as to why these UBPs exhibit variable fidelity and efficiency when used in different contexts is not clear. In an effort to gain some insights, we investigated the thermal stability and pairing selectivity of the (d) NaM &#8208;(d) TPT3 UBP in 11nt duplexes via UV spectroscopy and the effects on helical structure via CD spectroscopy. We observed that while the duplexes containing a UBP are less stable than fully natural duplexes, they are generally more stable than duplexes containing natural mispairs. This work provides the first insights connecting the thermal stability of the (d) NaM &#8208;(d) TPT3 UBP to the molecular mechanisms for varying replication fidelity in different sequence contexts in DNA, asymmetrical transcription fidelity, and codon:anticodon interactions and can assist in future UBP development.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Tuning Band Gaps of Cu2O and TiO2&#160;to&#160;form&#160;S&#8208;Scheme Hetero&#8208;Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic Z or S scheme merits higher redox potentials and faster charge separation. However, heterostructure photocatalyst having band gaps of bulk materials often has a type I band structure leading to poor photocatalytic activity. In view of this, we report simultaneous tuning of band gaps of Cu  2  O and TiO  2  , where quantum dot Cu  2  O nanoparticles were formed on doped TiO  2  with Ti  3+  .  The shrunk size of Cu  2  O made its conduction band more negative while the introduction of Ti  3+  made absorption edge red shift to visible light region. The as&#8208;formed heterostructure enabled S&#8208;Scheme mechanism with remarkable activity and stability for visible light photodegradation of 4&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP). The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts&#8217; activity demonstrated ca. 510 folds increase as compared to individual ones and mechanical blend. The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts maintained over 80% for 5 cycles and 2 months exposure to O  2  did not decrease degradation rate. ESR characterization and scavengers&#8217; experiments proved S&#8208;Scheme mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photo&#8208;Driven Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;driven seawater splitting is considered as one of the most promising techniques for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high salinity of seawater would deactivate catalysts and consumes the photogenerated carriers. Metal vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors are critical to directed electron transfer and high salinity resistance, thus desirable but remains a challenge. We demonstrate a facile controllable calcination approach to synthesize TiO  2  nanofibers with rich Ti&#8208;vacancies with excellent photo/electro performances and long&#8208;time stability in photo&#8208;driven seawater splitting, including photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of titanium vacancies, as well as its unidirectional electron trap and superior H  +  adsorption ability for efficient charge transfer and corrosion resistance of seawater. Therefore, the characteristics and mechanism have been proposed at an atomic&#8208;/nanoscale to clarify the generation of titanium vacancies and the corresponding interfacial electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;Zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket mimicking the constrains induced by a proteic structure was probed by 1D EXSY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. Results highlight: i) the very high kinetic stability of a tetrahedral ZnII centre when coordination of a fifth ligand is precluded by the environment, ii) the necessary associative double&#8208;exchange mechanism for ligand exchange, and iii) the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing the exchange.







Abstract
In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic ZnII centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of ZnII in proteins.

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent&#8208;organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) outline a resourceful illustration by uniting the remarkable properties of materials such as structural and chemical modulation, porosity and crystallinity, which can be productive for different types of metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting (Hydrogen evolution reaction, HER and Oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and solar cells.







Abstract
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of the crystalline porous materials family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, Evaluation and Structure of Allenic 1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Analogs with Locked Mobility at C&#8208;17</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Looking for side&#8208;chain conformational requirements of vitamin D analogs for selective biological activity, a new active vitamin D analog that has conformationally restricted mobility at the side chain and adopts a similar structure than the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the binding pocket was designed by docking and synthesized. The highlights of the synthesis include a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed cascade and an orthoester&#8208;Claisen&#8208;rearrangement for the formation of the trienic system and the allenic side&#8208;chain, respectively.







Abstract
Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system. However, hypercalcemic effects limit their therapeutical uses and call for the development of tissue&#8208;selective new analogs. We have designed and synthesized the first examples of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 analogs bearing an allenic unit attached to the D ring to restrict the side&#8208;chain conformational mobility. The triene system was constructed by a Pd0&#8208;mediated cyclization/Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process in the presence of an allenic side chain. The allenic moiety was built through an orthoester&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of a propargylic alcohol. The biological activity and structure of (22S)&#8208;1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;17,20&#8208;dien&#8208;24&#8208;homo&#8208;21&#8208;nor&#8208;vitamin D3 bound to binding domain of the vitamin D receptor, provide information concerning side&#8208;chain conformational requirements for biological activity.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Nerve Agents and Their Organophosphorus Surrogates: Toward Supramolecular Scavengers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nerve agents are lethal organophosphorus compounds (OPs), posing a serious threat to military and civilians. In spite of decades invested toward developing detoxifying systems acting as prophylactics or therapeutics, there has been insufficient progress. In this critical review, we posit that examining molecular recognition of nerve agents shall help constructing more effective scavengers of OPs.







Abstract
Nerve agents are tetrahedral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) that were developed in the last century to irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and therefore impede neurological signaling in living organisms. Exposure to OPs leads to a rapid development of symptoms from excessive salivation, nasal congestion and chest pain to convulsion and asphyxiation which if left untreated may lead to death. These potent toxins are prepared on a large scale from inexpensive staring materials, making it feasible for terrorist groups or states to use them against military and civilians. The existing antidotes provide limited protection and are difficult to apply to a large number of affected individuals. While new prophylactics are currently being developed, there is still need for therapeutics capable of both preventing and reversing the effects of OP poisoning. In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.

         <dc:description>
Keep it simple: A sustainable approach (ethyl acetate under ambient conditions without metals, additives or irradiation) for the synthesis of di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;hydroquinolines bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups has been developed.A Convenient Formal [4+2] Heterocylization Route to Bis(triflyl)tetrahydroquinolines (L&#225;zaro&#8208;Milla and Almendros) @IQOG_CSIC







Abstract
We report the sustainable and efficient synthesis of a new type of quinoline derivatives bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups. The protocol is metal&#8208;, catalyst&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free, involves the use of readily available and stable precursors, and avoids the formation of side products. Also, the mild conditions of the process allow the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques for the Structural Characterization of Geminal Alane&#8208;Phosphane Frustrated Lewis Pairs and Secondary Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state NMR characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane frustrated Lewis pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. For measuring internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances a new resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed by using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) pulses. By using this widely applicable technique, Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances in these compounds can be measured within a precision of &#177;0.1&#8197;&#197;.







Abstract
The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane frustrated Lewis pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. Their relevant NMR parameters (isotropic chemical shifts, direct and indirect 27Al&#8208;31P spin&#8208;spin coupling constants, and 27Al nuclear electric quadrupole coupling tensor components) have been determined by numerical analysis of the experimental NMR line shapes and compared with values computed from the known crystal structures by using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our work demonstrates that the 31P NMR chemical shifts for the studied Al/P FLPs are very sensitive to slight structural inequivalences. The 27Al NMR central transition signals are spread out over a broad frequency range (&gt;200&#8197;kHz), owing to the presence of strong nuclear electric quadrupolar interactions that can be well&#8208;reproduced by the static 27Al wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) Carr&#8208;Purcell&#8208;Meiboom&#8208;Gill (WCPMG) NMR experiment. 27Al chemical shifts and quadrupole tensor components offer a facile and clear distinction between three&#8208; and four&#8208;coordinate aluminum environments. For measuring internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances a new resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed by using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept WURST pulses.

         <title>Multifunctional Metal Phosphides as Superior Host Materials for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being a good host: Metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid materials have huge potential to boost the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;S batteries. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the use of metal phosphides for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries, in particular with a focus on the modified approaches, design principles, representative applications and development direction.







Abstract
For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage systems with large theoretical specific capacity has been urgently needed because of the rapid development of society. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for novel battery systems, since their resurgence at the end of the 20th century Li&#8722;S batteries have attracted ever more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is almost five times larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the determining factors in Li&#8722;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. For the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect that is caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In past decades, though the sulfur cathode has developed greatly, there are still some enormous challenges to be conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity, and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries by employing multifunctional metal phosphides as host materials. The current state of development of the sulfur electrode of Li&#8722;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between the essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, the chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latter&#8242;s influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, trends in the development and practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries are also pointed out.

         <title>Cascade Reaction to Selectively Synthesize Multifunctional Indole Derivatives by IrIII&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation cascade reaction: An effective way to synthesize a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double alkynylation of C&#8722;H bonds, whereas alkynyl on C4 position might convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles. Additionally, relay catalysis allowed the synthesis of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles by using an in&#8197;situ carbonyl group as the directing group.







Abstract
An effective and condition&#8208;controlled way to synthesize with high selectivity a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double C&#8722;H bond alkynylation, whereas alkynyl at the C4 position could convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles fast and effectively. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot relay catalytic reaction led to 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles when using a carbonyl group as the directing group and by controlling the type and quantity of additives. A possible mechanism was proposed based on many studies including deuterium&#8208;exchange experiments, the necessary conditions of product conversion, and the effect of water on the reaction.

         <title>Binding Sites, Vibrations and Spin&#8208;Lattice Relaxation Times in Europium(II)&#8208;Based Metallofullerene Spin Qubits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) is reported. As a unique structural difference, metal&#8208;cage binding site can be introduced in EMFs and is demonstrated to play a key role in determining rigidity of the three low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;displacing vibrations and the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1). Normalized by the frequencies of these vibrations, the temperature dependence of T1 shows a universal behavior for different compounds in frozen CS2 solution.







Abstract
To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The investigation of&lt;/b&gt; the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)-based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) is reported. As a unique structural difference, metal-cage binding site can be introduced in EMFs and is demonstrated to play a key role in determining rigidity of the three low-energy metal-displacing vibrations and the spin-lattice relaxation times (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Normalized by the frequencies of these vibrations, the temperature dependence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; shows a universal behavior for different compounds in frozen CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)-based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.&#8201;e. metal-cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low-energy metal-displacing vibrations in mediating the spin-lattice relaxation times (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The temperature dependence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin-vibration coupling in these EMF-based qubit candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Local Light&#8208;Controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space and time control: Light&#8208;induced mineralization of a barium carbonate/silica self&#8208;organized biomorph structure is possible by using the photobase ketoprofen through local pH increase and carbon dioxide release. Tuning the irradiation intensity or varying the irradiation time in subsequent growth cycles allows photochemical control of the morphology of the resulting structures. More information can be found in the Communication by J.&#8197;M. Garc&#237;a&#8208;Ruiz, H. C&#246;lfen, M. Montalti, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102321).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  3  (NVP) has been regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to its excellent structural stability and rapid Na  +  conductivity. However, its electrochemical performances are restricted by the large bulk structure and poor electronic conductivity. The construction of porous NVP materials is a powerful method to improve the electrochemical properties. This concept aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. In brief, we first review the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials. Furthermore, we outline the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To study the DNA damage caused by a potent platinum&#8211;acridine anticancer agent (PA) in cancer cells, an assay based on biorthogonal post&#8208;labeling using a click chemistry&#8208;enabled, azide&#8208;modified derivative (APA) was developed. The method involves biotinylation, affinity capture, and bead&#8208;based enrichment of APA&#8208;modified genomic DNA. The key steps of the assay were validated and optimized in model duplexes, including full&#8208;length plasmids, restriction fragments, and a DNA ladder. Native DNA treated with APA and subsequently subjected to post&#8208;labeling with a biotin affinity tag was enzymatically digested and fragments were analyzed by in&#8208;line LC&#8208;MS and MS/MS. The monofunctional&#8211;intercalative adducts formed by APA in 5&#180;&#8208;pyrimidine/guanine sequences in double&#8208;stranded DNA are quantitatively biotinylated by strain&#8208;promoted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition chemistry. When applied to DNA extracted from A549 lung cancer cells, the assay in combination with qPCR amplification demonstrates that platinum&#8211;acridines form adducts in the gene sequences encoding pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA, a potential pharmacological target of these agents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and room temperature photo&#8208;Wolff&#8208;Kischner reaction of sulfur ylides and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones has been developed for the first time to provide modular access to alkene synthesis. The high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope were demonstrated by more than 60 examples. Both  E  &#8208; and  Z  &#8208;olefinic stereochemistry in the products could be controlled with excellent stereoselectivity. A series of mechanistic studies support that the reaction should proceed through a radical&#8208;carbanion crossover pathway, specifically involving addition of photo&#8208;generated sulfur ylide radical cations to  N  &#8208;tosylhydrazones to form carbanions and subsequent Wolff&#8208;Kischner process.</dc:description>

         <title>Contorted Hetero&#8208;annulated Tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds are interesting materials for organic electronics applications. To fine&#8208;tune photophysical or electrochemical properties, either various substituents can be attached or heteroatoms (such as N or S) can be incorporated to the fused aromatic backbone. Coronenes and heterocoronenes are a promising compounds in this respect. Up to now, the possibilities to vary the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited and realizing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8211;donating rings attached at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[  a  ,  d  ,  j  ,  m  ]coronenes were synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step route, which is a combination of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction and the following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;&#8208;planes of the obtained  cata  &#8208;condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analysed by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV(vis spectroscopiy and electrochemical characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Induced Phospholipase A2 Inhibition: a Major Role for Interfacial Tryptophan Dioxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several studies have revealed that various diseases such as cancer have been associated with elevated phospholipase A  2  (PLA  2  ) activity. Therefore, the regulation of PLA  2  catalytic activity is undoubtedly vital. In this study, effective inactivation of PLA  2  due to reactive species produced from cold physical plasma as a source to model oxidative stress is reported. We found singlet oxygen to be the most relevant active agent in PLA  2  inhibition. A more detailed analysis of the plasma&#8208;treated PLA  2  identified tryptophan 128 as a hot spot, rich in double oxidation. The significant dioxidation of this interfacial tryptophan resulted in an N&#8208;formylkynurenine product via the oxidative opening of the tryptophan indole ring. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the efficient interactions between the tryptophan residue and phospholipids are eliminated following tryptophan dioxidation. As interfacial tryptophan residues are predominantly involved in the attaching of membrane enzymes to the bilayers, tryptophan dioxidation and indole ring opening leads to the loss of essential interactions for enzyme binding and, consequently, enzyme inactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosure of Ground State Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius Aromaticity in Radical Anion of [6]helicene and Evidence for 4p periodic Aromatic Ring Currents in a molecular &#8220;metallic&#8221; M&#246;bius Strip</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zimmerman proposed in 1966 a type of M&#246;bius aromaticity, which involves through&#8208;space electron delocalization and has since been widely applied to explain reactivity in pericyclic reactions, but is considered being limited to transition state structures. Although easily accessible hexahelicene radical anion is known for more than half a century, it was overlooked that it exhibits ground state minimum and robust Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius aromaticity in its central noose&#8208;like opening, becoming, hence, the oldest existing M&#246;bius aromatic system and with smallest M&#246;bius cycle known. Despite its overall aromatic stabilization energy of 13.6 kcalmol&#8208;1 (at B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G**), the radical also features a strong global induced paramagnetic ring current along its outer edge. Exclusive global paramagnetic currents can be found also in fully delocalized other radical anions of 4N+2 p&#8208;electron aromatic polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons (PAH), questioning the established magnetic criterion of antiaromaticity. As an example for a PAH with non&#8208;trivial topology, we studied a novel M&#246;bius[16]cyclacene, which has a non&#8208;orientable surface manifold and a stable closed shell singlet ground state at several density functional theory levels. Its metallic monoanion radical (0.0095 eV band gap at HSE06/6&#8208;31G* level) is also wave function stable and displays an unusual 4p&#8208;periodic magnetically induced ring current (reminiscent of transformation behavior of spinors under spatial rotation), indicating existence of a H&#252;ckel rule evading new type of aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexity of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura C&#8722;C bond formation reaction lies in the indivdual steps of the cycle, as well as in the generation of the catalytically active species. An overview of the topic is provided from a historical perspective.







Abstract
The story of C&#8722;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.

         <title>Photoswitchable Composite Polymer Electrolytes Using Spiropyran&#8208;Immobilized Nanoporous Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with smart, stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics have gained considerable attention owing to their noninvasive manipulation and applications in future technologies. To address this potential, in this work, we demonstrate photoresponsive composite polymer electrolytes, consisting of SPE and spiropyran&#8208;immobilized nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (SP&#8208;AAO) templates. Under UV irradiation, the close SP form isomerizes to the open merocyanine (MC) form, creating extremely polarized AAO surfaces; whereas under visible light irradiation, the MC form reverts to the SP form, creating neutral surface conditions. The electrostatic interactions between ions and AAO surfaces are investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, the behavior of ionic conductivity of the SPE@SP&#8208;AAO is found to be consistent with the kinetics of isomerization tracked by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This work provides a promising platform for developing next&#8208;generation photoelectronic smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness Promoted by &#8220;Ring Fusion&#8221; for the Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright, even at longer wavelengths: A &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; approach is proposed to adjust the emission wavelength from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region with enhanced total brightness of the fluorophore. Theoretical calculation confirms that our strategy can efficiently narrow the energy gap and lower the reorganization energy of the TTQP molecule, promoting sensitive fluorescent angiography and diagnosis of intestinal inflammation. This molecular design strategy thus is promising to enrich the library of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores for versatile bioimaging studies.







Abstract
Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, the common strategy of reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores so as to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bright, even at longer wavelengths&lt;/b&gt;: A &#8220;ring-fusion&#8221; approach is proposed to adjust the emission wavelength from the NIR-I to NIR-II region with enhanced total brightness of the fluorophore. Theoretical calculation confirms that our strategy can efficiently narrow the energy gap and lower the reorganization energy of the TTQP molecule, promoting sensitive fluorescent angiography and diagnosis of intestinal inflammation. This molecular design strategy thus is promising to enrich the library of NIR-II fluorophores for versatile bioimaging studies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorophores with emission in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, the common strategy of reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores so as to achieve red-shifted wavelengths always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept of &#8220;ring-fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen that can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR-I to NIR-II. The fused-acceptor-containing fluorophore yielded, TTQP, has an enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in nanoparticle formation compared to its NIR-I emissive counterpart (TTQ-DP) with a non-fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring fusion can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron-deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The TTQP NPs yielded thus allow sensitive NIR-II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular-engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR-II fluorophores.&lt;/p&gt;

Supra&#8208;typed molecules composed of a pyridine&#8208;based amphiphile complexed with 1,5&#8208;, 1,6&#8208;, 2,6&#8208;, or 2,7&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene self&#8208;assemble in water to form nanotubes. The inner diameters of the nanotubes strongly depend on the naphthalene regioisomers. The excimer fluorescence bands derived from J&#8208;type aggregates of the naphthalene in the nanotubes vary according to the different inner diameters. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Kameta and M. Kogiso (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101354).

         <title>General, Straightforward, and Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Vinyl Triflimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greatness in simplicity: A general, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be used to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on a gram scale with both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed some of its unique chemical properties. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Wang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102369).

         <title>Highly Sensitive Fluorescent pH Microsensors Based on the Ratiometric Dye Pyranine Immobilized on Silica Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical fluorescent pH sensors based on positively charged silica microparticles containing anionic pyranine molecules were developed by using a modified St&#246;ber method with a gradual immobilization of ratiometrically pH&#8208;sensing pyranine molecules during the growth of silica seed particles and an overall positive charge in a one&#8208;step reaction. The overly pH&#8208;sensitive nature of pyranine is preserved and long&#8208;term stability is ensured by silica shell coating. These cytocompatible ratiometric pH sensors can be used for pH sensing and pH tracking applications where each microparticle can be observed individually due to resolvable size. More information can be found in the Communication by A. Chandra, L.&#8197;L. del&#8197;Mercato et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101568).

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The dual behavior of the 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole mentioned in the title of this manuscript predicted by a theoretical NRT study represents the most significant point of this paper. Thus, a quite easily accessible molecule allowed us to observe two totally different reactivities; i.e., heterodyne&#8208; versus phosphinidene&#8208;like, both of them being highly desirable regarding future applications.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Re&#8208;Thinking Uncaging: A New Antiaromatic Photocage Driven by a Gain of Resonance Energy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable compounds  e.g.  photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited&#8208;state&#8208;aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Several thio&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;functionalized compounds were synthesized, photochemically characterized and further optimized, supported by quantum chemical calculations. After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100 nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#949;&#183;&#934;) of 893 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 405&#160;nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined functionalization: In this study, we achieved covalent functionalization of the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) with oxygen molecules and hydrogen atoms. The adsorption and thermal stability were investigated using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the functionalization is restricted to the pores of the nanomesh leading to spatially defined chemical modification of the two&#8208;dimensional material.







Abstract
We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of h&#8208;BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high&#8208;energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#8197;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D material. Hydrogen functionalization of h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#8197;K.

         <title>Divergent Construction of Diverse Scaffolds through Catalyst&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;H Activation Cascades of Quinazolinones and Cyclopropenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled cascades: We have successfully developed attractive C&#8722;H activation cascade reactions between quinazolinones and cyclopropenones. Different structures can be selectively synthesized under the precise control of the catalysts in a one&#8208;pot manner. The high efficiency, excellent chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, wide substrate scope, and amenability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis for both quinazolinones and cyclopropenones demonstrated the promising applicability of reactions.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation cascade strategy to rapidly construct diverse quinazolinone derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner is reported. The catalysts play an important role in the different transformations. Additionally, the procedure is scalable, proceeds with high efficiency and good chemo&#8208;/regio&#8208;selectivity, and tolerates a range of functional groups.

         <title>Cation Ordering and Exsolution in Copper&#8208;Containing Forms of the Flexible Zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M=H, Na) and Their Consequences for CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper cations favour 6&#8208;membered ring (6R) sites in dehydrated zeolite Rho, away from 8R windows that allow adsorption into lta cages. Exchange of Cu cations into Na&#8208;Rho, in which Na cations occupy 8R gating sites between the lta cages, improves CO2 uptake kinetics, while retaining some Na cations enhances CO2/CH4 selectivity. Upon dehydration, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho shows exsolution behaviour, because its framework can adopt distorted and undistorted forms that provide favourable coordination sites for Na and Cu cations, respectively.







Abstract
The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals that Cu2+ ions are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the d8r windows that control diffusion. Fully exchanged Cu&#8208;Rho remains in an open form upon dehydration, the d8r windows remain nearly circular and the occupancy of window sites is low, so that it adsorbs CO2 rapidly at room temperature. Breakthrough tests with 10&#8201;% CO2/40&#8201;% CH4 mixtures show that Cu4.9&#8208;Rho is able to produce pure methane, albeit with a relatively low capacity at this pCO2 due to the weak interaction of CO2 with Cu cations. This is in strong contrast to Na&#8208;Rho, where cations in narrow elliptical window sites enable CO2 to be adsorbed with high selectivity and uptake but too slowly to enable the production of pure methane in similar breakthrough experiments. A series of Cu,Na&#8208;Rho materials was prepared to improve uptake and selectivity compared to Cu&#8208;Rho, and kinetics compared to Na&#8208;Rho. Remarkably, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho with &gt;2 Cu cations per unit cell exhibited exsolution, due to the preference of Na cations for narrow S8R sites in distorted Rho and of Cu cations for S6R sites in the centric, open form of Rho. The exsolved Cu,Na&#8208;Rho showed improved performance in CO2/CH4 breakthrough tests, producing pure CH4 with improved uptake and CO2/CH4 selectivity compared to that of Cu4.9&#8208;Rho.

         <title>Effect of Heterometal&#8208;Functionalization and Template Exchange on the Redox Chemistry of Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution effect: Electrochemical structure&#8208;property relationships are reported for a metal&#8208;functionalized dodecavanadate cluster. To this end, the effects of heterometal substitution and template exchange on the redox properties are studied. The type of heterometal and the resulting structural distortion of the cluster shell are main factors controlling the cluster properties, while the redox potentials correlate with the overall cluster charge. Exchange of the template anion from chloride to bromide shows no major effect.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as material of interest in many applications such as energy storage and conversion due to their redox activity and molecularly defined structure. However, especially for polyoxovanadates a lack of understanding between structural modifications and physicochemical properties remains. The present study leverages a lacunary dodecavanadate to systematically investigate the electronic effect of heterometal functionalization. While structural distortion affects the stability of the cluster, the redox potentials correlate with the overall cluster charge. Furthermore, we report the first bromide&#8208;templated analogue of this cluster family. While the halide anion is crucial for the formation of the cluster, no major effect on the electrochemical properties is observed. By improving the understanding of structure&#8208;property relationship in this work, we hope to enable a more predictable tuning of redox&#8208;properties of polyoxovandates.

         <title>Redox Isomerism in the S3 State of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex Resolved by Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital&#8211;coupled cluster approach, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), was employed to obtain reliable relative energetics for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the Mn4Ca cofactor of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of photosystem&#8197;II in its final metastable S3 state. It is shown that the MnIV4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model is significantly more stable than the MnIII2MnIV2 peroxo model, thus disfavoring the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8722;O bond formation in biological water oxidation.







Abstract
The electronic and geometric structures of the water&#8208;oxidizing complex of photosystem II in the steps of the catalytic cycle that precede dioxygen evolution remain hotly debated. Recent structural and spectroscopic investigations support contradictory redox formulations for the active&#8208;site Mn4CaOx cofactor in the final metastable S3 state. These range from the widely accepted MnIV4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model, which presumes that O&#8722;O bond formation occurs in the ultimate transient intermediate (S4) of the catalytic cycle, to a MnIII2MnIV2 peroxo model representative of the contrasting &#8220;early&#8208;onset&#8221; O&#8722;O bond formation hypothesis. Density functional theory energetics of suggested S3 redox isomers are inconclusive because of extreme functional dependence. Here, we use the power of the domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital approach to coupled cluster theory, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), to present the first correlated wave function theory calculations of relative stabilities for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the S3 state. Our results enabled us to evaluate conflicting models for the S3 state of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) and to quantify the accuracy of lower&#8208;level theoretical approaches. Our assessment of the relevance of distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms for the mechanism of biological water oxidation strongly disfavors the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8722;O formation advanced by literal interpretations of certain crystallographic models. This work serves as a case study in the application of modern coupled cluster implementations to redox isomerism problems in oligonuclear transition metal systems.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Chemically Robust Ionic Porous Organic Polymers (iPOPs) toward Toxic Oxo&#8208;Pollutants Capture from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of utilization of imidazole&#8208;functionalized chemically robust cationic porous organic polymers (POPs) for rapid and efficient capture of hazardous dual oxo&#8208;anionic pollutants from water. The study will enrich the concept of designing new efficient cationic polymeric materials to tackle the problems based on water pollution, one of the most important threats towards the initiative for a green and clean environment.







Abstract
Fabricating new and efficient materials aimed at containment of water contamination, in particular removing toxic heavy metal based oxo&#8208;anions (e.&#8201;g. CrO42&#8722;, TcO4&#8722;) holds paramount importance. In this work, we report two new highly stable imidazolium based ionic porous organic polymers (iPOPs) decorated with multiple interaction sites along with electrostatics driven adsorptive removal of such oxo&#8208;anions from water. Both the iPOPs (namely, iPOP&#8208;3 and iPOP&#8208;4) exhibited rapid sieving kinetics and very high saturation uptake capacity for CrO42&#8722; anions (170 and 141&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for iPOP&#8208;3 and iPOP&#8208;4 respectively) and ReO4&#8722; (515.5 and 350.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for iPOP&#8208;3 and iPOP&#8208;4 respectively), where ReO4&#8722; anions being the non&#8208;radioactive surrogative counterpart of radioactive TcO4&#8722; ions. Noticeably, both iPOPs showed exceptional selectivity towards CrO42&#8722; and ReO4&#8722; even in presence of several other concurrent anions such as Br&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, SO42&#8722;, NO3&#8722; etc. The theoretical binding energy calculations via DFT method further confirmed the preferential interaction sites as well as binding energies of both iPOPs towards CrO42&#8722; and ReO4&#8722; over all other competing anions which corroborates with the experimental high capacity and selectivity of iPOPs toward such oxo&#8208;anions.

         <title>Development of Peripheral Functionalization Chemistry of&#160;meso&#8208;Free Corroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the extensive development of  meso  functionalization of porphyrins, that of corroles has been only rarely explored until the development of practical synthetic methods of  meso  &#8208;free corroles in 2015. Ready availability of  meso  &#8208;free corroles opened up  meso  &#8208;functionalization chemistry of corroles, giving rise to successful synthesis of various meso&#8208;substituted corroles such as  meso  &#8208;halogen,  meso  &#8208;nitro,  meso  &#8208;amino,  meso  &#8208;oxo, and  meso  iminocorroles as well as  meso&#8208;meso  linked corrole dimers and corrole tapes. In some cases, 2NH corroles existed as stable or transient radical species. The impacts of  meso  &#8208;functionalization on the structures, electronic properties, optical characteristics, and aromaticity are highlighted in this Minireview.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions at Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tunable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts (solvento complexes) do not catalyze effectively organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts in both homogenous and heterogenous catalysis. In this minireview, we discuss several relevant examples, based on X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, in which the hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds, as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8208;&#960; and pancake interactions, are used as a synthon in the decoration of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing Effect via Solvent Inclusions on the Linker Rotational Dynamics of Functionalized MIL&#8208;53</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breathing effects of functionalized MIL&#8208;53&#8208;X (X= H, CH  3  , NH  2  , OH, and NO  2  ) induced by the inclusions of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. 2D homo&#8208;nuclear correlation NMR provided direct experimental evidence for the host&#8208;guest interaction between the guest solvents and the MOFs framework. The variations of the  1  H and  13  C NMR chemical shifts in functionalized MIL&#8208;53 from the narrow pore phase transitions to large pore forms due to solvent inclusions were clearly identified. The influence of functionalized linkers and their host&#8208;guest interactions with the confined solvents on the rotational dynamics of the linkers was examined by separated&#8208;local&#8208;field MAS NMR experiments in conjunction with DFT theoretical calculations. It is found that the linker rotational dynamics of functionalized MIL&#8208;53 in narrow pore form is closely related to the computational rotational energy barrier. The BDC&#8208;NO  2  linker of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO  2  undergoes relatively faster rotation, whereas the BDC&#8208;NH  2  and BDC&#8208;OH linkers of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NH  2  and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;OH exhibit relatively slower rotation. The host&#8208;guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO  2  , MIL&#8208;53&#8208;CH  3  would significantly induce an increase of the order parameters of unsubstituted carbon and reduce the rotational frequency of linkers. This study provides a spectroscopic approach for the investigation of linker rotation in functionalized MOFs at natural abundance with solvents inclusions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaphenylditetrels &#8211; When Longer Bonds Provide Higher Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;Carbon bonds are exceptional as demonstrated for the hexaphenylditetrels where attractive London dispersion interactions are the decisive factor for the thermodynamic stabilities of tetrels other than carbon. Structural and energetic comparisons show that even though hexaphenylethane displays the largest dispersion energy between the two molecular halves, it has remained elusive because of even larger Pauli repulsion of the phenyl moieties that are forced in close contact due to the C&#8722;C bond that is the shortest in this series.







Abstract
We present a computational analysis of hexaphenylethane derivatives with heavier tetrels comprising the central bond. In stark contrast to parent hexaphenylethane, the heavier tetrel derivatives can readily be prepared. In order to determine the origin of their apparent thermodynamic stability against dissociation as compared to the carbon case, we employed local energy decomposition analysis (LED) and symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVP and sSAPT0/def2&#8208;TZVP levels of theory. We identified London dispersion (LD) interactions as the decisive factor for the molecular stability of heavier tetrel derivatives. This stability is made possible owing to the longer (than C&#8722;C) central bonds that move the phenyl groups out of the heavily repulsive regime so they can optimally benefit from LD interactions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Arylation of the Imidazole Side Chain of Protected Histidine by Using Triarylbismuth Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine transfer protocol: A method for the N&#8208;arylation of protected histidine using triarylbismuth reagents is reported. The reaction is promoted by copper diacetate and proceeds under smooth conditions, allowing the transfer of aryl groups on the distal nitrogen of the imidazole ring. A histidine&#8208;directed backbone N&#8722;H arylation was observed at the n&#8208;1 position of histidine&#8208;containing dipeptides.







Abstract
The N&#8208;arylation of the side chain of histidine by using triarylbismuthines is reported. The reaction is promoted by copper(II) acetate in dichloromethane at 40&#8201;&#176;C under oxygen in the presence of diisopropylethylamine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and allows the transfer of aryl groups with substituents at any position of the aromatic ring. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and is applicable to dipeptides where the histidine is located at the N terminus. A histidine&#8208;guided backbone N&#8722;H arylation was observed in dipeptides where the histidine occupies the C terminus.

         <title>Covalent Patterning of 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The patterned 2D MoS2 surface was achieved through covalent functionalization of electron beam lithography (EBL) defined guiding areas. The patterned MoS2 surface displays switchable surface characteristics in a spatially defined manner, confirmed by scanning Raman spectroscopy and PL mapping, which may hold great promise for the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
The development of an efficient method to patterning 2D MoS2 into a desired topographic structure is of particular importance to bridge the way towards the ultimate device. Herein, we demonstrate a patterning strategy by combining the electron beam lithography with the surface covalent functionalization. This strategy allows us to generate delicate MoS2 ribbon patterns with a minimum feature size of 2&#8197;&#956;m in a high throughput rate. The patterned monolayer MoS2 domain consists of a spatially well&#8208;defined heterophase homojunction and alternately distributed surface characteristics, which holds great interest for further exploration of MoS2 based devices.

This strategy allows us to generate delicate MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ribbon patterns with a minimum feature size of 2&#8197;&#956;m in a high throughput rate. The patterned monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; domain consists of a spatially well-defined heterophase homojunction and alternately distributed surface characteristics, which holds great interest for further exploration of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; based devices.&lt;/p&gt;

Ball and chain: The Pd8 strings supported by the linear tetraphosphines meso&#8208; and rac&#8208;dpmppm, [Pd8(meso&#8208; or rac&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 trap a C60 or C70 fullerene molecule in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction, exclusively affording the unprecedented metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired bucky balls, [{Pd4(meso&#8208; or rac&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C60 or 70)]X4 (L=CH3CN, XylNC; X=TfO, BF4), through chirality&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Reactions of Pd8 strings supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (meso&#8208;dpmppm) ligands, [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2]4+ (L=CH3CN (1), XylNC (2)) with C60 resulted in the exclusive formation of unprecedented metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired C60 bucky balls, [{Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C60)]4+ (L=CH3CN (11), XylNC (12)), in which a C60 fullerene is trapped in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction, as unambiguously established by spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic, and theoretical techniques. The similar reaction of Pd8 strings supported by rac&#8208;dpmppm, [Pd8(rac&#8208;dpmppm)4(CH3CN)2]4+ (3) also afforded a racemic mixture of [{Pd4((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)2(CH3CN)}2(C60)]4+ (13) without scrambling the Pd4 fragments with (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm ligands. Consequently, those of enantiopure chiral Pd8 strings, [Pd8((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)4(CH3CN)2]4+, certainly afforded chiral bucky balls of [{Pd4((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)2(CH3CN)}2(C60)]4+ (13RR and 13SS), that exhibit mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism spectra. The reactions of 1 and 2 were also applied for trapping a C70 fullerene to give 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts of [{Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C70)]4+ (L=CH3CN (21), XylNC (22)). These results provide useful information for creating a platform to develop dimensionally and chirality controlled metal&#8211;carbon nanocomposite materials.

         <dc:description>A novel hybrid photocatalyst composed of nano hollow carbon spheres (NCS) and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) curly nanosheets has been prepared by the calcination of NCS precursor and freeze&#8208;dried urea. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits an efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with the highest H  2  generation rate of 3612.3 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , leading to an apparent quantum yield of 10.04% at 420 nm, 5 times higher than the widely reported benchmark photocatalyst CN (2.01% AQY). The materials characterization shows that NCS&#8208;modified CN curly nanosheets can promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through their special coupling interface and NCS as an electron acceptor, which significantly improves the photocatalytic efficiency. Thus, this study provides a new strategy for the design of highly&#8208;efficient photocatalyst, particularly suitable for polymeric materials to construct a totally metal free photocatalytic structure.</dc:description>

The synthesis of various  N  &#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields.

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpectedly robust: We provide theoretical evidence and experimental proof of the unexpected stability of the AgIII&#8722;X bond with every halogen (X=F, Cl, Br and I) in the series of square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) derivatives [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX]. Unimolecular decomposition paths were analyzed by combined theoretical and experimental methods, whereby the two series of linear complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; were detected. The first silver(III) azide was also prepared, isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron AgI/AgIII processes is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon AgIII species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of AgIII towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, At) is theoretically analyzed. The results obtained depend on a single factor: the nature of X. Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable AgIII&#8722;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. The whole series of nonradiative halide complexes [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX] (X=F, Cl, Br, I) has been experimentally prepared and all its constituents have been isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh4][(CF3)3AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF3)3Ag(N3)] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido complex. Except for the iodo compound, all the crystal and molecular structures have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The thermal stability in the solid state gradually decreases from X=F (145&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) to X=I (78&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) The experimentally established compatibility of AgIII with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or silver&#8208;catalyzed processes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The involvement of silver in two-electron Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; processes is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AgX]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, At) is theoretically analyzed. The results obtained depend on a single factor: the nature of X. Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. The whole series of nonradiative halide complexes [PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AgX] (X=F, Cl, Br, I) has been experimentally prepared and all its constituents have been isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AgCN] and [PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido complex. Except for the iodo compound, all the crystal and molecular structures have been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AgX]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MS&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AgX]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [FAgX]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AgX]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The thermal stability in the solid state gradually decreases from X=F (145&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) to X=I (78&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) The experimentally established compatibility of Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver-mediated or silver-catalyzed processes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a Natural Resonance Theory study, 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole exhibits a dualistic behavior and can serve as a heterodiene or a hidden phosphinidene. This intriguing property has been confirmed chemically. It is able to react with established dienophiles via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, thereby forming new heterocyclic compounds, but it also donates two transition metals as a 4e ligand, thus mimicking a phosphinidene character. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Benk&#337;, L. Dost&#225;l, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101686).

Competent partners: &#960;&#8208;Allyl&#8211;nickel precatalysts supported by dialkylterphenyl phosphines efficiently couple a wide range of electrophiles including aryl iodides/bromides/chlorides and, for the first time, aryl and alkenyl tosylates with aromatic and aliphatic thiols. In addition, tandem C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N coupling of multi&#8208;electrophile/nucleophile combinations is achieved in a completely chemoselective manner leading to highly functionalized products.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part&#8197;2): Fragrance&#8208;Releasing Cleavable Surfactants in Functional Perfumery Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;based cleavable surfactant profragrances assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Formulated systems were found to be stable during storage and released a fragrance aldehyde upon hydrolysis while providing a balanced evaporation of co&#8208;solubilized perfumery molecules.







Abstract
Amphiphilic imines prepared by condensation of a hydrophobic fragrance aldehyde with a hydrophilic amine derived from a poly(propylene oxide) and poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer were investigated as cleavable surfactant profragrances in applications of functional perfumery. In water, the cleavable surfactants assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Dynamic headspace analysis on a glass surface showed that solubilized perfume molecules evaporated in a similar manner in the presence of the cleavable surfactant as compared with a non&#8208;cleavable reference surfactant. Under application conditions, the cleavable surfactant imine hydrolysed to release the covalently linked fragrance aldehyde. The profragrances were stable during storage in aqueous media, and upon dilution showed a blooming effect for the hydrolytical fragrance release and a more balanced performance of a solubilized perfume by retaining the more volatile fragrances and boosting the evaporation of the less volatile fragrances.

         <title>Type&#8208;II Clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 from a Redox&#8208;Preparation Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so far hardly accessible type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) was obtained in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio with &#945;&#8208;Ge from Na12Ge17 by redox reaction with benzophenone and subsequent heat treatment of the widely X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate. The phase is room&#8208;temperature transient, diamagnetic and shows metallic properties as revealed by Knight&#8208;shifted 23Na NMR signals and a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility.







Abstract
The metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 was obtained from Na12Ge17 by applying a two&#8208;step procedure. At first, Na12Ge17 was reacted at 70&#8201;&#176;C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na12Ge17, but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340&#8201;&#176;C under an argon atmosphere, the X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) and &#945;&#8208;Ge in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and 23Na solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Metallic properties of Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the 23Na NMR signals and by a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.

         <title>Molecular Cage Assembly by Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn Bridging of Di&#8208;, Tri&#8208; and Tetranuclear Organotin Tectons: Extending the Spacing in Double Ladder Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a cooperative effort between research groups from Dortmund (Germany, coat of arms on the left) and Cuernavaca (Morelos, M&#233;xico, coat of arms on the right), novel molecular cages were synthesized and characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art analytical methods and DFT calculations. Among these novel compounds, the spacer&#8208;bridged tetraorganodistannoxane in the centre showing a double&#8208;ladder structure exhibits a record spacing between the opposite tin centres. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Jurkschat, H. H&#246;pfl, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101055).

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting of a platinum precursor bearing a disilicate ligand, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, achieved the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species on silica supports. The chemical&#8208;shift values of the ancillary ligands were almost identical before and after the grafting, thus suggesting that the coordination sphere around platinum of the grafted species was nearly independent of the type of silica support and the degree of substitution on the disilicate ligand. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;C. Choi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101927).

In this image, a golden compass guides the adventurer's way in an unknown chemical space. The compass leads the structures with one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional content towards those with an increased three&#8208;dimensional character. These three&#8208;dimensional compounds rise towards uncharted chemical space leaving the flatland behind, based on the cascade cyclization of alkynyl azides generating indole fused medium&#8208;sized rings.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part&#8197;1): Controlled Hydrolysis of Micellar Amphiphilic Imines in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imines are hydrolytically unstable, but can be stabilized in aqueous media by self&#8208;assembly in micellar structures. Parameters such as pH, concentration, position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure and relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties affect the stability of the imine bond and can be adapted to form stimuli&#8208;responsive micelles suitable for controlling the release of bioactive volatiles.







Abstract
Despite their intrinsic hydrolysable character, imine bonds can become remarkably stable in water when self&#8208;assembled in amphiphilic micellar structures. In this work, we systematically studied some of these structures and the influence of various parameters that can be used to take control of their hydrolysis, including pH, concentration, the position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure, relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Thermodynamic and kinetic data led us to the rational design of stable imines in water, partly based on the location of the imine function within the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile and on a predictable quantitative term that we define as the total hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balance (HLB). In addition, we show that such stable systems are also stimuli&#8208;responsive and therefore, of potential interest in trapping and releasing micellar components on demand.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tuneable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative linkers activated by light sequentially release two phenolic cargos. Structurally modifying the lactate spacer responsible for self&#8208;immolation allows adjustable cargo release, ranging from minutes to days. The cargo release rate can be additionally tuned by varying the cargos. NMR spectroscopy coupled to UV light illumination enabled us to track and characterize products released during the self&#8208;immolation process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Proch&#225;zkov&#225;, O. Baszczy&#328;ski, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101805).

         <title>Engineered Cyclotides with Potent Broad in Vitro and in Vivo Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclotide is turning: By using a topologically modified sequence of protegrin PG&#8208;1, novel cyclotides were engineered with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed little hemolytic activity and was extremely stable in serum. In addition, this cyclotide was able to provide protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine P. aeruginosa&#8208;induced peritonitis model.







Abstract
The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to the rapid development of drug resistance to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates is reported. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity, and provided protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.

         <title>THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF THE RETAINING GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE MANNOSYLGLYCERATE SYNTHASE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress, as initially thought, but also against other extreme conditions. The observation that these molecules can confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms made them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&#160;
In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria&#160;  Rhodothermus marinus  . MGS is a promiscuous enzyme, accepting a variety of sugar donors and acceptors. This feature can be used to synthesize other molecules with potential biotechnological applications beyond MG. The unravelling of the catalytic mechanism with atomistic resolution and the associated free energies and electrostatic profiles of the stationary states obtained in the present work will help future investigations to full explore the potential of MGS.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;Imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky&#8208;blue to deep&#8208;blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.







Abstract
A series of dicyano&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano&#8208;imidazole with a short&#8208;conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron&#8208;transporting characteristics. Four different electron donors, that is, 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC), 10H&#8208;spiro(acridine&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;fluoren) (SPAC), and 9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DPAC), were used to alternate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to tune the emission color further. The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;EST) between the first excited singlet (S1) and the triplet (T1) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Azo&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8722;Organic Polyhedron as an Efficient Catalyst for CO2 Fixation with Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel zirconium&#8208;based metal organic polyhedron (MOP) with azo functionality has been synthesized and exhibits high catalytic activity for CO2 fixation. The azo group could enhance the solubility of the MOP as well as being good Lewis base sites to enrich CO2. DFT calculation showed Zr&#8208;AZDA MOP with the Lewis activity of Zr sites could dramatically reduce the energy barrier of CO2 cycloaddition.







Abstract
Chemical fixation of CO2 as C1 source at ambient temperature and low pressure is an energy&#8208;saving way to make use of the green&#8208;house gas, but it still remains a challenge since efficient catalyst with high catalytic active sites is required. Here, a novel monoclinic azo&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic polyhedron (Zr&#8208;AZDA) has been prepared and applied in CO2 fixation with epoxides. The inherent azo groups not only endow Zr&#8208;AZDA with good solubilization, but also act as basic sites to enrich CO2 showing efficient synergistic catalysis as confirmed by TPD&#8208;CO2 analysis. XPS results demonstrate that the Zr active sites in Zr&#8208;AZDA possess suitable Lewis acidity, which satisfies both substrates activation and products desorption. DFT calculation indicates the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in CO2 cycloaddition could be reduced remarkably (by ca. 60.9&#8201;%) in the presence of Zr&#8208;AZDA, which may rationalize the mild and efficient reaction condition employed (80&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm of CO2). The work provides an effective multi&#8208;functional cooperative method for improvement of CO2 cycloaddition.

         <title>The Coordinate Reaction Model: An Obstacle to Interpreting the Emergence of Chemical Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate descriptions: Time&#8208;invariant (T1) models are the basis of the molecular description of modern organic chemistry. However, applied to open systems far from equilibrium, they may lead to erroneous interpretations. In such systems, stationary states must be described, in both their stability and evolution (generalized evolution criterion), through irreversibility (time variant, T&#8722;1) by macroscopic systems methods. Even ordinate, abscissa and curves, in reductionistic graphical descriptions; have different meanings.







Abstract
The way chemical transformations are described by models based on microscopic reversibility does not take into account the irreversibility of natural processes, and therefore, in complex chemical networks working in open systems, misunderstandings may arise about the origin and causes of the stability of non&#8208;equilibrium stationary states, and general constraints on evolution in systems that are far from equilibrium. In order to be correctly simulated and understood, the chemical behavior of complex systems requires time&#8208;dependent models, otherwise the irreversibility of natural phenomena is overlooked. Micro reversible models based on the reaction&#8208;coordinate model are time invariant and are therefore unable to explain the evolution of open dissipative systems. The important points necessary for improving the modeling and simulations of complex chemical systems are: a) understanding the physical potential related to the entropy production rate, which is in general an inexact differential of a state function, and b) the interpretation and application of the so&#8208;called general evolution criterion (GEC), which is the general thermodynamic constraint for the evolution of dissipative chemical systems.

         <title>Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211;and wires and wells, too&#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other&#8217;s electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface-to-volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211;and wires and wells, too&#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other&#8217;s electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Osmaindenes: Synthesis and Reversible Mechanochromism Characteristics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  bearing different substituents (CF  3  , H, I, Br, OCH  3  , N(Ph)  2  ) has been synthesized by nucleophilic reaction of water with the corresponding aromatic osmanaphthalyne complexes. All osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  have been characterized by elemental analysis (EA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, although the low solubilities of  3  and  4  precluded the accumulation of their  13  C NMR spectra. Osmaindenes  2  ,  3  and  5  have also been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Subsequently, through solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, mechanochromic studies, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we found that osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  fluoresce at wavelengths in the range 500&#8211;800 nm, while also displaying reversible mechanochromic properties. The solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission of  1  after grinding extends into the near&#8208;infrared region. This research provides new insight into the design and synthesis of metallic materials with excellent mechanochromic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The stereoselective oxidation of para&#8208;substituted benzenes by a cytochrome P450 biocatalyst.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serine 244 to aspartate (S244D) variant of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP199A4 was used to expand its substrate range beyond benzoic acids. Substrates, in which the carboxylate group of the benzoic acid moiety is replaced, were oxidised with high activity by the S244D mutant (product formation rates &gt; 60 nmol.(nmol&#8208;CYP) &#8722;1 .min &#8722;1 ) and with total turnover numbers of up to 20,000. Ethyl &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was more rapid than methyl oxidation, styrene epoxidation and S &#8208;oxidation. The S244D mutant catalysed the ethyl hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions with an excess of one stereoisomer (in some instances up to &gt;98%). The crystal structure of 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid&#8208;bound CYP199A4 S244D showed that the active site architecture and the substrate orientation were similar to that of the WT enzyme. Overall, this work demonstrates that CYP199A4 can catalyse the stereospecific hydroxylation, epoxidation or sulfoxidation of substituted benzene substrates under mild conditions resulting in more sustainable transformations using this heme monooxygenase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Isotope Effects in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is key to understanding reaction mechanisms in many areas of chemistry and chemical biology, including organometallic chemistry. This ratio of rate constants,  k  H  /  k  D  , typically falls between 1&#8208;7. However, KIEs up to 105 have been reported, and can even be so large that reactivity with deuterium is unobserved. We collect here examples of large KIEs across organometallic chemistry, in catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, along with their mechanistic interpretations. Large KIEs occur in proton transfer reactions such as protonation of organometallic complexes and clusters, protonolysis of metal&#8211;carbon bonds, and dihydrogen reactivity. C&#8211;H activation reactions with large KIEs occur with late and early transition metals, photogenerated intermediates, and abstraction by metal&#8208;oxo complexes. We categorize the mechanistic interpretations of large KIEs into the following three types: (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step. This comprehensive collection of large KIEs in organometallics provides context for future mechanistic interpretation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Multiple&#160;Dimensional Assemblies from Tryptophan&#8208;Based Racemate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating structural complex assemblies from simple amino acid&#8208;based derivatives is attracting great research interests due to their easy accessibility and preparation. However, the morphological regulation of racemates (an equimolar mixture of enantiomers) were largely overlooked. In this work, through rational modulation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, we achieved multiple dimensional architectures employing tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM). Upon assembling, 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers could be obtained depending on the solvents used. The corresponding morphology evolutions were successfully illustrated by changing the enantiomeric excess (ee) value. Moreover, for RPWM, uniform 0D nanospheres were formed in H  2  O under 4 &#8451;, which could spontaneously convert into lamella under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of its temperature&#8208;responsive phase change behavior, RPWM assemblies exhibited excellent removal efficiency for organic dye RhB, and could be reused for several consecutive cycles without significant changes in its removal performance. Taken together, it&#8217;s rational to envision that the engineering of racemates assembly pathways can greatly increase the robustness in a wide variety of supramolecular materials and further lead to their blooming versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Pentafluoropyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the  13  C and  15  N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960; &#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; staking interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Functional Interface with Built&#8208;in Catalytic and Self&#8208;oxidation Sites for Highly Stable Lithium Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical energy density. The rapid redox conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is effective for solving the serious shuttle effect and improving utilization of active materials. The functional design of separator interface with the fast charge transfer and active catalytic sites is desirable for accelerating the conversion of intermediates. Herein, the graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3  nanowire (G@MC) was prepared and utilized to engineer the separator interface. G@MC with active Mn2+  sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn&#8208;S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+  sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS  via  the spontaneous &#8220;self&#8208;redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC&#8208;based battery exhibits only 0.038% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

G@MC with active Mn2+  sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn-S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+  sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS  via  the spontaneous &#8220;self-redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC-based battery exhibits only 0.038% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li-S battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated  in situ  via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand. The controlled oxygenation of a  tert  &#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (  prinol  ) ligand leads to an&#160;adduct of a (  prinol  )ZnOO  t  Bu moiety with the parent  t  BuZn(  prinol  ) complex and a novel dimer [  t  BuOOZn(  prinol  )]  2  with terminal alkylperoxide groups.&#160;Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]  x  [ROOZn(L)]  y  &#8208;type are known, the reported herein homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]  x  aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between  t  BuZn(  prinol  ) and  tert  &#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Self&#8208;Assembled Gel Beads for Tunable pH&#8208;Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the fabrication of new pH&#8208;responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;  d  &#8208;sorbitol: pH&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;COOH and thermally&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;CONHNH  2  , clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads using this approach. We also demonstrate that self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;component gel beads can be formed using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS&#8208;COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present on raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid&#8208;lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH&#8208;dependent, with greater release at pH 7.4 than at pH 4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the pKa of the API. The extent of pH&#8208;mediated API release, is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS&#8208;COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH 7.4, while the three&#8208;component DBS&#8208;COOH/DBS&#8208;CONHNH  2  /alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Hydrogen Tunneling in o&#8208;Tolylmethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>o  &#8208;Tolylmethylene  1  is a metastable triplet carbene that rearranges to  o  &#8208;xylylene  2  even at temperatures as low as 2.7 K via [1,4] H atom tunneling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopical techniques were used to identify two conformers of  1  (  anti  and  syn  ) in noble gas matrices and in frozen organic solutions. Conformer&#8208;specific kinetic measurements revealed that the rate constants for the rearrangements of the  anti  and  syn  conformers of  1  are very similar. However, the orbital alignment in the  syn  conformer is less favorable for the hydrogen transfer reaction than the orbital configuration in the  anti  conformer. Our spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigations indicate that  anti  1  and  syn  1  rapidly interconvert via efficient quantum tunneling forming a rotational pre&#8208;equilibrium. The subsequent second tunneling reaction, the [1,4] H migration from  anti  1  to  2  , is rate&#8208;limiting for the formation of  2  . We here present an efficient strategy for the study of such tunneling equilibria.</dc:description>

         <title>Protection of Ag Clusters by Metal&#8208;Oxo Modules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse and atomically precise Ag nanoclusters have attracted considerable recent research interest. A conventional silver cluster usually consists of a silver metallic kernel and an organic peripheral ligand shell. Nevertheless, the present inevitable problem is the unsatisfied stability of such nanoclusters. In this concept, we will give an introduction to Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules which exhibit enhanced stability and unique properties. Accordingly, three different types of clusters are summarized: (1) Ag clusters protected by mononuclear oxometallates; (2) Ag clusters protected by block&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters; (3) Ag clusters protected by hollow&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters. The aim of this concept is to offer possible general guidance and insight into future rational design of more metal&#8208;oxo clusters protected silver clusters or even other coinage metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As a H  2  O  2  generator, 2e  &#8208;  oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo  2  S  4  towards 2e  &#8208;  reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S  2&#8208;  . The result implies this weakens the interaction between NiCo  2  S  4  and OOH*, suppresses O&#8208;O bond breaking and enhances H  2  O  2  selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H  2  O  2  produced by oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and release &#183;OH, which degrades organic pollutants with advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe  2+  free character. With Zn as anode, the electrocatalyst as cathode material, Zn&#8208;O  2  battery is assembled.

         <title>Autotandem Catalysis: Inexpensive and Green Access to Functionalized Ketones by Intermolecular Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Amidoalkynylation/Hydration Cascade Reaction via N&#8208;Acyliminium Ion Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based catalysts were applied in cascade&#8208;type reactions for the synthesis of different carbonyl compounds. The reactions proceeded by a new iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade of alkynylation/hydration by using both the &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Lewis acid properties of iron salts. The alkynylation reactions of several endo and exocyclic acetoxylactams were achieved with three different catalysts including FeCl  3  .6H  2  O, FeCl  3  , and Fe(OTf)  3  showing the efficiency of &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity of iron (III) salts in catalyzing the alkynylation reaction. We also demonstrated that the reaction sequence could be shortened by the direct use of hydroxylactams, leading to an environmentally friendly protocol, avoiding the need to perform unnecessary lengthy steps. A combination of the hard/soft iron Lewis acid properties was then used to implement an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence allowing expedient access to a new carbonyl structures from trivial materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Binding in the Ferroxidase Site of Human Mitochondrial Ferritin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferritins are nanocage proteins that store iron ions in their central cavity as hydrated ferric oxide biominerals. In mammals, further the L (light) and H (heavy) chains constituting cytoplasmic maxi&#8208;ferritins, an additional type of ferritin has been identified, the mitochondrial ferritin (MTF). Human MTF (hMTF) is a functional homopolymeric H&#8208;like ferritin performing the ferroxidase activity in its ferroxidase site (FS), in which Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. To better investigate its ferroxidase properties, here we performed time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis of hMTF, providing structural evidence of how iron ions interact with hMTF and of their binding to the FS. Transient iron binding sites, populating the pathway along the cage from the iron entry channel to the catalytic center, were also identified. Furthermore, our kinetic data at variable iron loads indicate that the catalytic iron oxidation reaction occurs via a diferric peroxo intermediate followed by the formation of ferric&#8208;oxo species, with significant differences with respect to human H&#8208;type ferritin.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxygen &#8208; bearing motifs, mainly the congener heterocycles are ubiquitous due to their presence in various natural products and bioactive scaffolds. Although in literature, several strategies have been developed for their synthesis, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come forward as a method of choice and has been used extensively.&#160; In particular, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has gained enormous attention from the synthetic community due to the rapid access to a very useful and reactive synthetic intermediate like &#8216;enol ether&#8217;. Furthermore, to manifold the utility of these methods, reports have been developed elaborating the generation of &#8216;enol ether&#8217; using hydroalkoxylation and their usage in various reactions in cascade or tandem manner.

         <title>Electroresponsive Performances of Ecoresorbable Smart Fluids Consisting of Various Plant&#8208;Derived Carrier Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper proposes the fabrication of a new type of electrorheological (ER) fluid with ecoresorbable features as well as excellent electroresponsive performance. The proposed ER fluid consists of biocompatible Mg&#8208;doped silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (ST HNPs) suspended in vegetable oils (canola, grapeseed, olive, and soy). The effects of biodegradable plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids on the ER performance are analyzed. The polarizability and wettability of the fabricated ER fluids are studied. The high polarizability of the nanoparticles contributes to the high electroresponsive performance by inducing electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles under electric fields, which enables the formation of a rigid and strong fibril structure. A suitable wettability, which represents the favorable interaction between the oil and the nanoparticles, allows the nanoparticles to disperse evenly in the oil and prevents their aggregation, therefore making it easier to form a rigid and strong fibrillar structure under the electric field.</dc:description>

         <title>Are Heavy Pnictogen &#8208; &#960; Interactions Really &#8220;&#960; Interactions&#8221; ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions of heavy pnictogens with &#960;&#8208;arenes play a fundamental role in fields like crystal engineering or catalysis. The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of &#960;&#8208;arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state of the art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat&#8208;twist conformers, suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilize the desired conformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein phase separation process involving protein unfolding, misfolding, condensation and aggregation  etc.  has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. The complexity in protein conformational transitions results in multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;species biochemical pathways upon protein phase separation. Recent progresses in designing novel fluorescent probes have unraveled the enriched details of phase separated proteins and provided mechanistic insights towards disease pathology. In this review, we summarized the design and characterizations of fluorescent probes that selectively illuminate proteins at different phase separated states with a focus on aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes, fluorescent molecular rotors, and solvatochromic fluorophores. Inspired by these pioneering works, a design blueprint was proposed to further develop fluorescent probes that can potentially shed light on the unresolved protein phase separated states in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenols (  I  ) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (  I  ), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (  I  ) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors  via  single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8208;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives  I  to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phenols (  I  ) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry.

Specifically, phenolates (  I  ) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors  via  single-electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond-forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C-H functionalization.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water via &#8216;Marangoni effect&#8217; surface tension changes caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move further and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8216;stamp&#8217; &#8211; circles moved the furthest while stars showed more rotational movement on their own axis. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8216;solid&#8208;like&#8217; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery, suggests that adding them into self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.</dc:description>

         <title>The influence of secondary interactions on the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]+ halogen bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]  +  complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their  15  N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity and Passivation of Fe Nanoclusters on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on  h&#8208;  BN/Rh(111) was studied using  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208; NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On&#8208;top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300 K. C&#8208; and O&#8208;precovered Fe&#8208;NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe&#8208;NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Dye for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial  T25@F127  with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore  T25  , and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800 &#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400 &#956;m) , respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial  T25@cRGD  with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3 mm&#215;1.0 mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR = 3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated  T25  behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for  in vivo  biological application.</dc:description>

In contrast to its chlorido analogue  3  , complex  5  &#183;(HF)  4  reacted with CO or the ynamide 1-(2-phenylethynyl)-2-pyrrolidinone to yield the complexes  trans  -[Pt(CO){  &#954;  2  -(  P  ,  C  )-  i  Pr  2  P  (C  9  H  7  N  C  O)}{  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N)}][F(HF)  4  ] (  7  ) and a complex, which we suggest to be  cis  -[Pt{  C  =C(Ph)OCN(C  3  H  6  )}{  &#954;  2  -(  P  ,  N  )-  i  Pr  2  P  (C  9  H  7  N  )}{  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N)}][F(HF)  4  ] (  9  ).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Rate Capability and Lifespan MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF Electrode for High Performance Battery&#8208;Type Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MnCo2O4&#160;is derived from a Co/Mn&#160;bimetallic MOF.&#160;Then Ni&#8208;MOF is directly grown&#160;on the surface of the obtained MnCo2O4&#160;to form a nano&#8208;flower structure with small balls. Big surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo2O4&#160;and porosity of Ni&#8208;MOF allow the prepared MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composition material to deliver&#160;an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo2O4&#160;precursor&#160;is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo2O4&#160;and electrochemical performances of the resulted composition material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo2O4&#8208;600/Ni&#8208;MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance&#160;(when the current density increases from 1 to 10 A&#183;g&#8208;1, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41%) and good cycle stability&#160;(the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74% after 20,000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF has a good application prospect in the market.</dc:description>

         <title>A full flexible NH4+&#160; ion battery based on the concentrated hydrogel electrolyte for enhanced performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal ammonium&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of NH  4  +  &#160;ion&#160;redox chemistry&#160;in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#183;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference,&#160;AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121 mAh g&#8208;1&#160; and capacity retention of 95% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160;&#8208;1. The full flexible AIBs are then fabricated using hydrogel electrolytes with varied salt concentrations, to maximize the electrochemical performance. It is found that the battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3 M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance&#160;i.e., a capacity of 60 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;while maintaining a capacity retention of 88% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160; &#8208;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for future developments of new electrochemical energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Photoaffinity Probes for Live&#8208;Cell MS&#8208;Based Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a one&#8208;step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live&#8208;cell MS&#8208;based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan&#8208;BET selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on&#8208; and off&#8208;target profiles.</dc:description>
