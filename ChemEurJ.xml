      <title>Heterobimetallic Transition&#8208;Metal Carbonyl Clusters: Changing the Charges</title>
      <dc:description>The homoleptic group 5 carbonylates [M(CO)6]&#8211; (M&#160;=&#160;Nb, Ta) serve as ligands in carbonyl terminated heterobimetallic AgmMn&#8208;clusters containing 3 to 11 metal atoms. Based on our serendipitous [Ag6{Nb(CO)6}4]2+ (4a2+) precedent, we established access to such AgmMn&#8208;clusters of the composition [Agm{M(CO)6}n]x (M&#160;=&#160;Nb, Ta; m&#160;=&#160;1, 2, 6; n&#160;=&#160;2, 3, 4, 5; x&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;, 1+, 2+). Salts of those molecular cluster ions were synthesized by the reaction of [NEt4][M(CO)6] and Ag[Al(ORF)4] (RF&#160;=&#160;C(CF3)3) in the correct stoichiometry in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene at &#8211;35 &#176;C. The solid&#8208;state structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods and, owing to the thermal instability of the clusters, a limited scope of spectroscopic methods. In addition, DFT based AIM calculations were performed to provide an understanding of the bonding within these clusters. Apparently, the clusters 3+ (m = 6, n = 5) and 42+ (m = 6, n = 4) are superatom complexes with trigonal&#8208;prismatic or octahedral Ag6&#8208;superatom cores. The [M(CO)6]&#8211; ions then bind through three CO units as tridentate chelate ligands to the superatom core giving overall structures related to tetrahedral AX4 (42+) or trigonal bipyramidal AX5 molecules (3+).</dc:description>

      <title>Lignin biodegradation by a cytochrome P450 enzyme: A computational study into syringol activation by GcoA</title>
      <dc:description>A recently characterized cytochrome P450 isozyme GcoA activates lignin components through a selective O&#8208;demethylation or alternatively an acetal formation reaction. These are important reactions in biotechnology and since lignin is the main component in plant cell walls it is readily available. In this work we present a density functional theory study on a large active site model of GcoA to investigate syringol activation by an iron(IV)&#8208;oxo heme cation radical oxidant (Compound I) leading to hemiacetal and acetal products. Several substrate&#8208;binding positions were tested and full energy landscapes calculated. The study shows that substrate positioning determines the product distributions. Thus, with the phenol group pointing away from the heme, an O&#8208;demethylation is predicted, whereas an initial hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction of the weak phenolic O&#8210;H group would trigger a pathway leading to ring&#8208;closure to form acetal products. Predictions on how to engineer P450 GcoA to get more selective product distributions are given.</dc:description>

      <title>Construction of Rich Conductive Pathways from Bottom to Up: a Highly&#8208;Efficient Charge&#8208;Transfer System Used in Durable Li/Na&#8208;Ion Batteries at &#8208;20 oC</title>
      <dc:description>Constructing potential electrode materials with a wide temperature property for high energy density second batteries has attracted huge interests in recent years. Herein, a hybrid electrode, consisting of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/&#945;&#8208;MnS/flake graphite composite (&#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG), was prepared via a post&#8208;sulfurization route. In the &#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG composite, &#945;&#8208;MnS nanoparticles that wrapped by N&#8208;C layer are uniformly embedded onto FG, forming a novel nanofoam structure. As&#8208;obtained &#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG shows excellent lithium/sodium storage performance, with a specific capacity of 712 mAh g&#8208;1 in the 700th cycle at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 or 186.4 mAh g&#8208;1 in the 100th cycle at 100 mA g&#8208;1 using lithium or sodium foil as the counter electrode, respectively. Moreover, even operated at stern temperature of &#8208;20 oC, the &#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG can still attain high specific capacity of 350&#8239;mAh g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles at 100&#8239;mA&#8239;g&#8722;1 for LIBs. This exceptional electrochemical response is endorsed to the synergetic effect of the smart design of a hybrid nanofoam structure, in which the FG skeleton and N&#8208;C coating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode from bottom to up. Accordingly, the enhanced redox kinetics endow the electrode with pseudocapacitive&#8208;dominated electrochemical behaviors, thus bringing fast electrode reactions and robust structural stability to the whole electrode.</dc:description>

Moreover, even operated at stern temperature of &#8208;20 oC, the &#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG can still attain high specific capacity of 350&#8239;mAh g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles at 100&#8239;mA&#8239;g&#8722;1 for LIBs. This exceptional electrochemical response is endorsed to the synergetic effect of the smart design of a hybrid nanofoam structure, in which the FG skeleton and N&#8208;C coating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode from bottom to up. Accordingly, the enhanced redox kinetics endow the electrode with pseudocapacitive&#8208;dominated electrochemical behaviors, thus bringing fast electrode reactions and robust structural stability to the whole electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Using Native Chemical Ligation for Site&#8208;specific Synthesis of Hetero&#8208;bis&#8208;lanthanide Peptide Conjugates: Application to Ratiometric Visible or Near&#8208;infrared Detection of Zn2+</title>
      <dc:description>The interest for ratiometric luminescent probes that detect and quantify a specific analyte is growing. Due to their special luminescence properties, lanthanide(III) cations offer attractive opportunities for the design of dual&#8208;color ratiometric probes. Here, we describe the design principle of hetero&#8208;bis&#8208;lanthanide peptide conjugates using native chemical ligation for a perfect control of the localization of each lanthanide cation within the molecule. Two zinc&#8208;responsive probes, r&#8208;LZF1Tb|Cs124|Eu and r&#8208;LZF1Eu|Cs124|Tb are described on the basis of a zinc finger peptide and two DOTA complexes of terbium and europium. Both display dual&#8208;color ratiometric emission responding to the presence of Zn2+. Using a screening approach, anthracene was identified for the sensitization of the luminescence of two near infrared&#8208;emitting lanthanides, Yb3+ and Nd3+. Thus, two novel zinc&#8208;responsive hetero&#8208;bis&#8208;lanthanide probes, r&#8208;LZF3Yb|Anthra|Nd and r&#8208;LZF3Nd|Anthra|Yb were assembled, the former offering a neat ratiometric response to Zn2+ with emission in the near&#8208;infrared around 1000 nm, which is unprecedented.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Three novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) featuring triazatruxene electron&#8208;donating units bridged by different 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers have been synthesized, characterized, and implemented in mesoporous perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The opto&#8208;electronic properties of the new dumbbell&#8208;shaped derivatives (DTTXs) are highly influenced by the chemical structure of the EDOT&#8208;based linker. Red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission and a stronger donor ability were observed in passing from DTTX&#8208;1 to DTTX&#8208;2 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. DTTX&#8208;3 featured an intramolecular charge transfer between the external triazatruxene units and the azomethine&#8208;EDOT central scaffold, resulting in a more pronounced red shift.

Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.48% and 18.30% were measured for DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2, respectively, close to that measured for the benchmarking HTM spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (18.92%). PSCs with DTTX&#8208;3 reached a PCE value of 12.68%, which is attributed to the poorer film&#8208;formation in comparison to DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2. These PCE values are in perfect agreement with the conductivity and hole mobility values determined for the new compounds and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence further confirm the potential of DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2 for hole&#8208;transport applications as an alternative to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.</dc:description>

Through five proposed levels of contribution, chemists can take a significant part in this global approach via the consideration of green chemistry principles, the simplification of syntheses, the limitation of complex products preparation, the efficient utilization of resources but also the novel ways of waste valorization.

      <title>Mechanism of Iodine(III)&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Dearomatizing Hydroxylation of Phenols: Evidence for Radical&#8208;Chain Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>The oxidative dearomatization of phenols with the addition of nucleophiles to the aromatic ring induced by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and catalysts has emerged as a highly useful synthetic approach. However, experimental mechanistic studies of this important process have been extremely scarce. In this report, we describe systematic investigations of the dearomatizing hydroxylation of phenols using an array of experimental techniques. Kinetics, EPR spectroscopy, and reactions with radical probes demonstrate that the transformation proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain mechanism, with a phenoxyl radical being the key chain&#8208;carrying intermediate. Moreover, UV and NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry show that before reacting with the phenoxyl radical, water molecule becomes activated by the interaction with the iodine(III) center, causing the  Umpolung  of this formally nucleophilic substrate. The radical&#8208;chain mechanism allows to rationalize all existing observations regarding the iodine(III)&#8208;promoted oxidative dearomatization of phenols.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The Te&#8230;Te secondary bonding interactions (SBI) in solid heterocyclic telluroethers were explored by preparing and structurally characterizing a series of [Te(CH2)m]n (n = 1&#8208;4; m = 3&#8208;7) species.&#160; The SBIs in 1,7&#8208;Te2(CH2)10, 1,8&#8208;Te2(CH2)12, 1,5,9&#8208;Te3(CH2)9, 1,8,15&#8208;Te3(CH2)18, 1,7,13,19&#8208;Te4(CH2)20, 1,8,15,22&#8208;Te4(CH2)24, and 1,9,17,25&#8208;Te4(CH2)28 led to the tubular packing of the molecules, as has been observed previously for related thio&#8208; and selenoether rings. The nature of the intermolecular interactions was explored by solid&#8208;state PBE0&#8208;D3/pob&#8208;TZVP calculations involving periodic boundary conditions. The packing of molecules in 1,7,13,19&#8208;Te4(CH2)20, 1,8,15,22&#8208;Te4(CH2)24, and 1,9,17,25&#8208;Te4(CH2)28 form infinite shafts. The electron densities at bond critical points indicate a narrow range of Te&#8230;Te bond orders of 0.12&#8208;0.14. The formation of the shafts can be rationalized by frontier orbital overlap and charge&#8208;transfer.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the cell uptake and subcellular distribution in BODIPY&#8208;carboranyl dyads: An experimental and theoretical study.</title>
      <dc:description>A set of BODIPY&#8208;carboranyl dyads synthesized by a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, where different C&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;carboranyl fragments have been linked to a BODIPY fluorophore is described. Chemical, photophysical and physicochemical analyses are presented, including NMR and SXRD experiments, optical absorption/emission studies and log P measurements. These studies, supported by DFT computations (M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;31G**) provide an explanation to the largely divergent cell income that these fluorescent carboranyl&#8208;based fluorophores display, for which a structural or physicochemical explanation remains elusive. By studying the cell uptake efficiency and subcellular localization for our set of dyads on living HeLa cells, we tracked the origins of these differences to significant variations in their static dipole moments and partition coefficients, which tune their ability to interact with lipophilic microenvironments in cells. Remarkably, m&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;BODIPY derivatives with a higher lipophilicity are much better internalised by cells than their homologous with o&#8208;carborane, suggesting that m&#8208;isomers are potentially better theranostic agents for in vitro bioimaging and boron carriers for BNCT.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Structure and Chiral Aggregation of Liquid Crystalline Star&#8208;Shaped Triazines H&#8208;Bonded to Benzoic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>The ability of a star&#8208;shaped tris(triazolyl)triazine derivative to hierarchically build supramolecular chiral columnar organizations through the formation of 1:3 H&#8208;bonded complexes with benzoic acids was studied from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Although the star&#8208;shaped triazine core crystallizes in a non&#8208;  C  3  conformation, the  C  3  &#8208;symmetric conformation is theoretically predicted to be more stable and gives rise to a favourable  C  3  supramolecular 1:3 complex upon the interaction with three benzoic acids in their voids. In addition, calculations at different levels (DFT, PM7, and MM3) for the 1:3 host&#8208;guest complex predict the formation of large stable columnar helical aggregates stabilized by the compact packing of the interstitial acids by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The acids restrict the movement of the the star&#8208;shaped triazine cores along the stacking axis causing a template effect in the self&#8208;assembly of the complex. Theoretical predictions correlate with experimental results, since the interaction with achiral or chiral 3,4,5&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxybenzyloxy)benzoic acids gives rise to supramolecular complexes that organize in bulk in hexagonal columnar mesophases stable at room temperature with intracolumnar order. The existence of supramolecular chirality in the mesophase was determined for complexes formed by acids derived from (  S  )&#8208;2&#8208;octanol. Chiral aggregation was also evidenced for complexes formed in dodecane.</dc:description>

      <title>Disulfide bond replacement with 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted [1,2,3]&#8208;triazole on C&#8208;X&#8208;C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) peptide ligands: small changes that make big differences</title>
      <dc:description>Here we investigate&#160;the structural and biological effects ensuing form the disulfide bond replacement of a potent and selective C&#8208;X&#8208;C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) peptide antagonist, with 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208; disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moieties. Both strategies produced candidates that showed high affinity and selectivity against CXCR4. Notably, when assessed for their ability to modulate the CXCL12&#8208;mediated cell migration, the 1,4&#8208;triazole variant conserved the antagonistic effect in the low&#8208;mid nanomolar range, while the 1,5&#8208;triazole one displayed the ability to activate the migration, becoming the first in class low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight CXCR4 peptide agonist. By combining NMR and computational studies, we provided a valuable model that highlighted differences in the interactions of the two peptidomimetics with the receptor that could account for their different functional profile. Finally, we envisage that our findings could be translated to different GPCR&#8208;interacting peptides for the pursuit of novel chemical probes that could assist in dissecting the complex puzzle of this fundamental class of transmembrane receptors.</dc:description>

      <title>A bis&#8208;chelating (O^N^O)/(N^N) ligand for the synthesis of heterobimetallic Pt(II)/Re(I) complexes: tools for the optimization of a new class of Pt(II) anticancer agents.</title>
      <dc:description>The two independent (O^N^O) and (N^N) coordination sites of a newly synthesized bis 2&#8208;(hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole platform have been exploited to prepare four monometallic neutral (O^N^O)Pt(II) complexes carrying DMSO, pyridine, triphenylphosphine or N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as fourth ligand. Then the second (N^N) coordination site was used to introduce an IR&#8208;active rhenium tricarbonyl entity, affording the four corresponding heterobimetallic neutral Pt(II)/Re(I) complexes as well as a cationic Pt(II)/Re(I) derivative. X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies showed that distortion of the organic platform occurred to accommodate the coordination geometry of both metal centers. No ligand exchange and no transchelation occurred upon incubation of the Pt(II) complexes in aqueous environment or in the presence of Fe(III), respectively. The ligand and the complexes antiproliferative activity was first screened on the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231. Then the IC  50  of the most active candidates was determined on a wider panel of human cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, MCF&#8208;7 and A2780) as well as on a non&#8208;tumorigenic cell line (MCF&#8208;10F). Low micromolar activities were reached for the complexes carrying a DMSO ligand, making them the first examples of highly active though hydrolytically stable Pt(II) complexes. Finally, the characteristic mid&#8208;IR signature of the Re(CO)  3  fragment in the Pt/Re heterobimetallic complexes was used to quantify their uptake in breast cancer cells.</dc:description>

      <title>The Coordination Chemistry of the N&#8208;Donor Substituted Phosphazanes Alex J. Plajer,a* Andrew D. Bond a and Dominic S. Wright a*</title>
      <dc:description>Phosph(III)azanes, featuring the heterocyclobutane P  2  N  2  ring, have now been established as building blocks in main group coordination and supramolecular compounds. Previous studies have largely involved their use as neutral P&#8208;donor ligands or as anionic N&#8208;donor ligands, derived from deprotonation of amido&#8208;phosphazanes [RNHP(&#956;&#8208;NR)]  2  . The use of neutral amido&#8208;phosphazanes themselves as chelating, H&#8208;bond donors in anion receptors has also been an area of recent interest because of the ease by which the proton acidity and anion binding constants can be modulated, by the incorporation of electron withdrawing  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;cyclic groups (R) and by the coordination of transition metals to the ring P atoms. We observed recently that the effect of P,N&#8208;chelation of metal atoms to the P atoms of  cis  &#8208;[(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) not only pre&#8208;organises the N&#8208;H functionality for optimum H&#8208;bonding to anions but also results in a large increase in anion binding constants, well above those for traditional organic receptors like squaramides and ureas. Here we report a broader investigation of ligand chemistry of [(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;  t  NBu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) and of the new quinolyl derivative [(8&#8208;Qu)NHP(&#956;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (8&#8208;Qu = 8&#8208;quinolyl). The additional N&#8208;donor functionality of the heterocyclic substituents and its position has a marked effect on the anion and metal coordination chemistry of both species, leading to novel structural behaviour and reactivity compared to unfunctionalized counterparts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Increasing the quantum yield of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive dyes is critical for biological applications because these fluorescent dyes generally show decreased emission efficiency under aqueous conditions. In this work, we designed and synthesized several multiarylpyrrole (MAP) derivatives, in which a furanylidene (FE) group at the 3&#8208;position of the pyrrole forms donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules, MAP&#8208;FE, with a NIR emissive wavelength and aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission (AEE) features. Different alkyl chains of MAP&#8208;FEs linked to phenyl groups at the 2,5&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring resulted in different emissive wavelengths and quantum yields in aggregated states, such as powders or single crystals. Powder XRD data and single crystal analysis elucidated that the different lengths of alkyl chains had a significant impact on the regularity of MAP&#8208;FEs when they were forced to aggregate or precipitate, which affected the intermolecular interaction and the restriction degree of the rotating parts, which are essential components. Therefore, an increasing number of NIR dyes could be developed by this design strategy to produce efficient NIR dyes with AEE. Moreover, this method can provide general guidance for other related fields, such as organic solar cells and organic light&#8208;emitting materials, because they are all applied in the aggregated state.</dc:description>

      <title>Pseudocapacitive  Lithium Storage of Cauliflower&#8208;like CoFe2O4 for Low&#8208;Temperature Battery Operation</title>
      <dc:description>Binary transition metal oxides (BTMOs) with hierarchical micro&#8208;nano structures have attracted great interest as potential anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we report the fabrication of hierarchical cauliflower&#8208;like CoFe2O4  (cl&#8208;CoFe2O4) via a facile room&#8208;temperature co&#8208;precipitation method followed by post&#8208;synthetic annealing. The obtained cauliflower structure is constructed by the assembly of microrods, which themselves are composed of small nanoparticles. Such hierarchical micro&#8208;nano structure can promote fast ion transport and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. As a result, the cl&#8208;CoFe2O4  can deliver high capacity (1019.9 mAh g&#8722;1  at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (626.0 mAh g&#8722;1  at 5 A g  &#8722;1), and good cyclability (675.4 mAh g&#8722;1  at 4 A g&#8722;1  for over 400 cycles) as an anode material for LIBs. Even at low temperatures of 0 &#176;C and &#8722;25 &#176;C, the cl&#8208;CoFe2O4  anode can deliver high capacities of 907.5 and 664.5 mAh g&#8722;1  at 100 mA g&#8722;1, respectively, indicating its wide operating temperature. More importantly, the full&#8208;cell assembled with a commercial LiFePO4  cathode exhibits a high rate performance (214.2 mAh g&#8722;1  at 5000 mA g&#8722;1) and an impressive cycling performance (612.7 mAh g&#8722;1  over 140 cycles at 300 mA g&#8722;1  ) in the voltage range of 0.5&#8208;3.6 V.

      <title>Rapid discrimination of crystal handedness using XNCD mapping</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new method for determining the handedness of individual non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals in a mixture using a tightly&#8208;focused, circularly polarized X&#8208;ray beam. The X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism (XNCD) spectra measured at the metal K&#8208;edge on selected crystals of [&#916;&#8208;M(en)  3  ](NO  3  )  2  and [&#923;&#8208;M(en)  3  ](NO  3  )  2  (M = Co(II), Ni(II)) show extrema at the metal pre&#8208;edge (7712 eV for Co, 8335 eV for Ni). A mapping of a collection of some 220 crystals was then performed at the respective energies using left and right circular polarizations. The difference in absorption for the two polarizations, being either negative or positive, directly yielded the handedness of the crystal volume probed by the beam. Using this technique, it was found that the addition of L&#8208;ascorbic acid during the synthesis of [Co(en)  3  ](NO  3  )  2  resulted in an enantiomeric enrichment of the &#923;&#8208;isomer of 70&#177;12%, while the Ni analogue was similarly, but conversely, enriched in the &#916;&#8208;isomer (67&#177;21%).</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced DNA Lesions in Dormant Bacteria. The Peculiar Route Leading to Spore Photoproduct Characterized by Multiscale Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <dc:description>Some bacterial species enter a dormant state in the form of spores to resist to unfavorable external conditions. Spores are resistant to a wide series of stress agents, including UV radiation, and can last for tens to hundreds of years. Due to the suspension of biological functions such as DNA repair, they accumulate DNA damage upon exposure to UV radiation. Differently from active organisms, the most common DNA photoproduct in spores are not cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, but rather the so&#8208;called spore photoproduct. This non&#8208;canonical photochemistry results from the dry state of DNA and the binding to small acid soluble proteins that drastically modify the structure and photoreactivity of the nucleic acid. In this contribution, we use multiscale molecular dynamics simulations including extended classical molecular dynamics and QM/MM biased dynamics to elucidate the coupling of electronic and structural factors leading to this photochemical outcome.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some bacterial species enter a dormant state in the form of spores to resist to unfavorable external conditions. Spores are resistant to a wide series of stress agents, including UV radiation, and can last for tens to hundreds of years. Due to the suspension of biological functions such as DNA repair, they accumulate DNA damage upon exposure to UV radiation. Differently from active organisms, the most common DNA photoproduct in spores are not cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, but rather the so&#8208;called spore photoproduct. This non&#8208;canonical photochemistry results from the dry state of DNA and the binding to small acid soluble proteins that drastically modify the structure and photoreactivity of the nucleic acid. In this contribution, we use multiscale molecular dynamics simulations including extended classical molecular dynamics and QM/MM biased dynamics to elucidate the coupling of electronic and structural factors leading to this photochemical outcome. In particular, we rationalize the well&#8208;described impact of the peculiar DNA environment found in spores on the favored formation of the spore photoproduct, given the small free energy barrier found for this path. Meanwhile, the specific organization of spore DNA precludes the photochemical path leading to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formation&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Nitrogen and oxygen co&#8208;doping assisted synthesis of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles on hollow carbon spheres as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of O2 (ORR) provides an opportunity yet remains challenging to achieve the commercial application of clean energy, thus the rational design for inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts is inevitable. The Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts have emerged as a class of the most promising candidates for ORR that could accelerate the O2 adsorption, dissociation and electron transfer.

      <title>Molecular Chirality in Classical Spacetime: Solving the Controversy about the Spinning Cone Model of Rotating Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Re&#8208;examining chirality: The disagreement between Barron and Mislow regarding the potential chirality of a spinning cone is settled. The controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and a new definition of chirality, which encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin, is used to prove that both authors were right.







Abstract
The spinning cone is a model of rotating molecules used by Barron in 1986 in relation to asymmetric synthesis and to parity violation. He considered that the non&#8208;translating cone spinning about its symmetry axis has false chirality (i.e., it is not chiral), whereas Mislow concluded in 1999 that it is indeed chiral and severely criticized the true versus false chirality nomenclature introduced by Barron, who still disagreed in 2013 with the conclusion of Mislow. Here, it is shown that this controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and that in fact both authors were right. Light is thrown on the true chirality versus false chirality controversy with a very recently published result, which was thus unavailable to both authors: this is a new definition of chirality that encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin at the end of the 19th century.

      <title>A porous mooncake&#8208;shaped Li4Ti5O12 anode material modified by SmF3 and its electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Reasonably designing and synthesizing advanced electrode materials is significant to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF, Mil&#8208;125) is used as a precursor and template to successfully synthesize the porous mooncake&#8208;shaped Li  4  Ti  5  O  12  (LTO) anode material assembled from nanoparticles. Even more critical, SmF  3  is used to modify the prepared porous mooncake&#8208;shaped LTO material. The SmF  3  modified LTO still maintains a porous mooncake&#8208;shaped structure with a large specific surface area, and the SmF  3  nanoparticles are observed to attach on the surface of the LTO material. It has been proved that the SmF  3  modification can further facilitate the transition from Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  , reduce the polarization of electrode, decrease charge transfer impedance (  R  ct  ) and solid electrolyte interface  impedance (  R  se  i  ), and increase the lithium&#8208;ions diffusion coefficient (  D  Li  ), thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LTO. Therefore, the porous mooncake&#8208;shaped LTO modified using 2  wt  % SmF  3  displays a large specific discharge capacity of 143.8 mAh g  &#8208;1  with an increment of 79.16% compared to pure LTO at a high rate of 10 C (1 C=170mAh g  &#8208;1  ), and shows a high retention rate of 96.4% after 500 cycles at 5 C&#8208;rate.</dc:description>

      <title>LGBTQ+ in STEM: Visibility and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;Out and Proud&#8221; goes beyond slogans and efforts to make scientific workplaces more diverse and inclusive to LGBTQ+ scientists are being felt in Europe.







Abstract
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer (LGBTQ+, &#8220;+&#8221;=plus other sexes, gender identities, and sexual orientation) people in the STEM fields (STEM=science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) continue to experience discrimination in their workplace. In the last decade, the clamor for safe and diverse spaces continue to rise. Indeed, social media plays a huge part on increasing visibility of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. LGBTQ+ scientists have not only promoted discourse and raised concerns to the online community, but more importantly, supported each other in platforms such as Twitter. Beyond social media, work at the institutes by LGBTQ+ individuals are also bearing fruit. This piece explores the grassroots work of scientists as they work hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with their institute staff and leadership to promote diversity and inclusivity within and beyond their community.

      <title>Investigating Ugi / Passerini multicomponent reactions for the Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation of Native Trastuzumab</title>
      <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective modification of proteins has been the object of intense studies over the past decades, especially in the therapeutic field. Prominent results have been obtained with recombinant proteins, for which site&#8208;specific conjugation is made possible by the incorporation of particular amino acid residues or peptide sequences. In parallel, methods for the site&#8208;selective and site&#8208;specific conjugation of native and natural proteins are starting to thrive, allowing the controlled functionalization of various types of amino acid residues. Pursuing the efforts in this field, we planned to develop a new type of site&#8208;selective method, aiming at the simultaneous conjugation of two amino acid residues. We reasoned that this should give higher chances of developing a site&#8208;selective strategy compared to the large majority of existing methods that solely target a single residue. We opted for the Ugi four&#8208;center three&#8208;component reaction to implement this idea, with the aim of conjugating the side&#8208;chain amine and carboxylate groups of two neighbouring lysine and aspartate/glutamate. Herein, we show that this strategy can give access to valuable antibody conjugates bearing several different payloads, and limits the potential conjugation sites to only six on the model antibody trastuzumab.</dc:description>

      <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Emission from Tetraphenylethylene Units and Their Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Thanks to the potential of&#160;aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#160;(AIE) phenomena, improved stabilities, and the good selectivity and sensitivity of the chemical responses exhibited by&#160;the products, coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly&#160;with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units has recently received much attention&#160;and has been widely investigated&#160;for application in chemical sensors, cell imaging agents, light&#8208;harvesting systems, and others. Several reviews have emerged&#160;on the topics of AIE&#160;chemistry and aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based&#160;supramolecular assembles, however, there is still a distinct lack of full overviews of emission enhancement from the viewpoint of metal&#8208;coordination effects. Thus, this review offers a summary of recent advances that have been made in the design and application of TPE&#8208;based metallacycles, metallacages, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and&#160;coordination polymers&#160;(CPs).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the potential of&#160;aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#160;(AIE) phenomena, improved stabilities, and the good selectivity and sensitivity of the chemical responses exhibited by&#160;the products, coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly&#160;with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units has recently received much attention&#160;and has been widely investigated&#160;for application in chemical sensors, cell imaging agents, light&#8208;harvesting systems, and others. Several reviews have emerged&#160;on the topics of AIE&#160;chemistry and aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based&#160;supramolecular assembles, however, there is still a distinct lack of full overviews of emission enhancement from the viewpoint of metal&#8208;coordination effects. Thus, this review offers a summary of recent advances that have been made in the design and application of TPE&#8208;based metallacycles, metallacages, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and&#160;coordination polymers&#160;(CPs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Fluorine induced pseudo&#8208;anomeric effects in methoxycyclohexanes through electrostatic 1,3&#8208;diaxial interactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report counter intuitive axial preferences in non stereochemically biased, selectively fluorinated methoxycyclohexanes. These pseudo&#8208;anomeric effects are apparent when electronegative CF 2 groups are placed at the C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 positions of the cyclohexane ring to render the C&#8208;3/5 axial hydrogens electropositive. The electrostatic interaction between these axial hydrogens and the &#8208;OMe oxygen is stabilising. The effect is explored using high level ab initio and DFT calculations in the framework of NBO, QTAIM and NCI analysis across a range of derivatives, and experimentally ( 19 F{ 1 H}&#8208;NMR at &#8208;80 o C) for some illustrative examples. The effect is significant in energy terms for a weak interaction, and illustrates a new stereoelectronic aspect attributed to selective fluorine substitution in organic chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>An artificial hemoprotein with inducible peroxidase&#8208; and monooxygenase&#8208;like activities</title>
      <dc:description>A new inducible artificial metalloenzyme was obtained by covalent attachment of a Mn(III)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin to the artificial bidomain repeat protein (A3A3&#8217;)Y26C. The biohybrid was characterized by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS, circular dichroism and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies. Its peroxidase activity was tested as well as its monooxygenase activity for the oxidation of thioanisole into sulfoxide by H  2  O  2  . Catalytic tests were performed on the original scaffold and with&#160; several co&#8208;catalysts a) additional imidazole, b) a specific &#945;Rep bA3&#8208;2 that induces the opening of the (A3A3&#8217;) interdomain region and c) a &#945;Rep bA3&#8208;2 bearing a His6&#8208;Tag (His6&#8208;bA3&#8208;2), and the best activity was obtained with His6&#8208;bA3&#8208;2. The mechanism was rationalized by a molecular modeling study including protein&#8208;ligand docking and large scale molecular dynamics. It appears that: 1) the hydrophobic Mn&#8208;porphyrin fits well into the (A3A3&#8217;)Y26C cavity, becomes protected by the protein and fully soluble in water; 2) the biohybrid alone does not display any catalytic activity, even in the presence of imidazole because of a closed conformation of the system; 3) opening of the binding site by bA3&#8208;2 leads to a noticeable activity and, 4) the best activity is obtained in the presence of the His6&#8208;Tag with one or two of the histidines able to coordinate to the metal acting as co&#8208;catalyst in the reactions.

      <title>Multifunctional Electrocatalytic Cathodes Derived from Metal Organic Frameworks for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The rechargeable lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is a promising candidate for the next&#8211;generation of energy storage technology, owing to the high theoretical capacity, high specific energy density, and low cost of electrode materials. The main drawbacks of developing long&#8211;life Li&#8211;S batteries are capacity fading and the kinetic sluggishness at the cathode caused by the polysulfides shuttle. To address these limitations, we have designed novel nanocages containing cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in highly porous nitrogen&#8211;doped carbon (CoP&#8211;N&#8211;GC) by thermal annealing of ZIF&#8211;67 in a reductive atmosphere followed by a phosphidation step using sodium hypophosphite. The large surface area and the uniform homogeneous distribution of CoP nanoparticles within the N&#8211;doped nanocages graphitic carbon act as electrocatalysts to suppress the shuttle of soluble polysulfides through strong chemical interactions, while catalyzing the sulfur redox. As a result, the S@CoP&#8211;N&#8211;GC electrode delivers an extremely high specific capacity of 1410 mA h g  &#8211;1  at 0.1 C (1C = 1675 mA g  &#8211;1  ) with an excellent coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Moreover, capacity retention from 864 to 678 mA h g  &#8211;1  was obtained after 460 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.046% per cycle at 0.5 C. Therefore, the combination of CoP catalyst and polar conductive porous carbon effectively stabilizes the sulfur cathode, enhancing the electrochemical performance and stability of the battery.</dc:description>

      <title>Towards more photostable, brighter, and less phototoxic chromophores: Synthesis and properties of porphyrins functionalized with cyclooctatetraene</title>
      <dc:description>Free base and zinc porphyrins functionalized with cyclooctatetraene (COT), a molecule known as a good triplet state quencher, have been obtained and characterized in detail by structural, spectral, and photophysical techniques. Substitution with COT leads to a dramatic decrease of the intrinsic lifetime of the porphyrin triplet. As a result, photostability in oxygen&#8208;free solution increases by 2&#8208;3 orders of magnitude. In non&#8208;degassed solutions, improvement of photostability is about tenfold for zinc porphyrins, but the free bases become less photostable. Similar quantum yields of photodegradation in free base and zinc porphyrins containing the COT moiety indicate a common mechanism of photochemical decomposition. The new porphyrins are expected to be much less phototoxic, since the quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation strongly decreases because of shorter triplet lifetime. The reduction of triplet lifetime should also enhance the brightness and reduce blinking in porphyrin chromophores emitting in single molecule regime, since the duration of dark OFF states will be shorter.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of the locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer states of the anticancer drug lapatinib by ultrafast spectroscopy and computational studies</title>
      <dc:description>Lapatinib (LAP) is an anticancer drug, which is metabolized to the N&#8208; and O&#8208;dealkylated products (N&#8208;LAP and O&#8208;LAP, respectively). In view of the photosensitizing potential of related drugs, a complete experimental and theoretical study has been performed on LAP, N&#8208;LAP and O&#8208;LAP, both in solution and upon complexation with human serum albumin (HSA). In organic solvent, coplanar locally excited (LE) emissive states are generated; they rapidly evolve towards twisted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states. By contrast, within HSA only LE states are detected. Accordingly, femtosecond transient absorption reveals a very fast switching (ca. 2 ps) from LE (&#955;  max  = 550 nm) to ICT states (&#955;  max  = 480 nm) in solution, whereas within HSA the LE species become stabilized and live much longer (up to the ns scale). Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm that the coplanar orientation is preferred for LAP (or to a lesser extent N&#8208;LAP) within HSA, explaining the experimental results.</dc:description>

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared BODIPY&#8208;Acridine Dyads Acting as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Functioning Photosensitizers</title>
      <dc:description>Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes represent a particular class within the broad array of potential photosensitizers. Their highly fluorescent nature opens the door for theragnostic applications, combining imaging and therapy using a single, easily synthesized chromophore. However, near&#8208;infrared absorption is strongly desired for photodynamic therapy to enhance tissue penetration. Furthermore, singlet oxygen should preferentially be generated without the incorporation of heavy atoms, as these often require additional synthetic efforts and/or afford dark cytotoxicity. Solutions for both problems are known, but have never been successfully combined in one simple BODIPY material. Here, we present a series of compact BODIPY&#8208;acridine dyads, active in the phototherapeutic window and showing balanced brightness and phototoxic power. Although the donor&#8208;acceptor design was envisioned to introduce a charge transfer state to assist in intersystem crossing, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations refute this. Further photophysical investigations suggest the presence of exciplex states and their involvement in singlet oxygen formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Aqueous Precursor Induced Morphological Change and Improved Water Stability of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>In literature, lead halide perovskites are very notable for their degradation in the presence of polar solvents, such as water.

In this order, the shape and phase transformation from CsPbBr3 nanoplates to CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanorods and Cs4PbBr6 nanowires can be controlled with increasing water content in the precursor solution. While adding water up to an ideal amount, CsPbBr3 maintains its phase and nanoplates morphology. The key role of water amount for tuning the crystallinity, stability, morphology, optical properties and phase transformation of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals will be beneficial in future commercialization of optoelectronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Ambident Reactivity of Imidazolium Cations as Evidence of the Dynamic Nature of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Mediated Organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Ambident nucleophilic reactivity of imidazolium cations at the C2 and C4 carbene centers indicated the dynamic nature of imidazolium&#8208;based organocatalysis proceeding by means of a covalent interaction of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl substrates and was explained by the generation of the H&#8208;bonded ditopic carbanionic carbenes along with the classical C2 carbenes. Based on these findings, covalent bonding of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl group of enolizable ketones was investigated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Galkin, B.

      <title>Female Faculty: Why So Few and Why Care?</title>
      <dc:description>
Diversity in academia: Data shows that there are few female faculty in academia today, with the percentage decreasing the higher the rank. There are many common responses to gender equality efforts that hamper progress of women in academia. Herein, we counteract such comments and discuss possible solutions along with concerns about how the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic may affect diversity in academia.







Abstract
Despite slow ongoing progress in increasing the representation of women in academia, women remain significantly under&#8208;represented at senior levels, in particular in the natural sciences and engineering. Not infrequently, this is downplayed by bringing forth arguments such as inherent biological differences between genders, that current policies are adequate to address the issue, or by deflecting this as being &#8220;not my problem&#8221; among other examples. In this piece we present scientific evidence that counters these claims, as well as a best&#8208;practice example, Genie, from Chalmers University of Technology, where one of the authors is currently employed. We also highlight particular challenges caused by the current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Finally, we conclude by proposing some possible solutions to the situation and emphasize that we need to all do our part, to ensure that the next generation of academics experience a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable working environment.

      <title>Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity and Catalytic Implications of a Cationic, Acetylide&#8208;Bridged Trigold&#8211;JohnPhos Species</title>
      <dc:description>
Multinuclear gold: A new family of tri&#8208;AuI complexes have been characterised as intermediates during the [AuIL][SbF6] catalytic preparation of acetaldehyde acetals. These well&#8208;characterised cationic AuI intermediates lend support to the proposed reaction mechanism. An analogous copper complex revealed different behaviour, leading to a vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles.







Abstract
The cationic complex [(JohnPhos&#8211;Au)3(acetylide)][SbF6] (JohnPhos=(2&#8208;biphenyl)di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine, L1) has been characterised structurally and features an acetylide&#8211;trigold(I)&#8211;JohnPhos system; the trinuclear&#8211;acetylide unit, coordinated to the monodentate bulk phosphines, adopts an unprecedented &#956;,&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1 coordination mode with an additional interaction between distal phenyl rings and gold centres. Other cationic &#963;,&#960;&#8208;[(gold(I)L1)2] complexes have also been isolated. The reaction of trimethylsilylacetylene with various alcohols (iPrOH, nBuOH, n&#8208;HexOH) catalysed by cationic [AuIL1][SbF6] complexes in CH2Cl2 at 50&#8201;&#176;C led to the formation of acetaldehyde acetals with a high degree of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction mechanism was studied, and several organic and inorganic intermediates have been characterised. A comparative study with the analogous cationic [CuIL1][PF6] complex revealed different behaviour; the copper metal is lost from the coordination sphere leading to the formation of cationic vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles. Additionally, a new catalytic approach for the formation of this high&#8208;value cationic vinylphosphonium has been established.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cationic complex [(JohnPhos&#8211;Au)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(acetylide)][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (JohnPhos=(2&#8208;biphenyl)di&#8208;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butylphosphine, L1) has been characterised structurally and features an acetylide&#8211;trigold(I)&#8211;JohnPhos system; the trinuclear&#8211;acetylide unit, coordinated to the monodentate bulk phosphines, adopts an unprecedented &#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode with an additional interaction between distal phenyl rings and gold centres. Other cationic &#963;,&#960;&#8208;[(gold(I)L1)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes have also been isolated. The reaction of trimethylsilylacetylene with various alcohols (&lt;i&gt;i &lt;/i&gt;PrOH, &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt;BuOH, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;HexOH) catalysed by cationic [Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;L1][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 50&#8201;&#176;C led to the formation of acetaldehyde acetals with a high degree of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction mechanism was studied, and several organic and inorganic intermediates have been characterised. A comparative study with the analogous cationic [Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;L1][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] complex revealed different behaviour; the copper metal is lost from the coordination sphere leading to the formation of cationic vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles. Additionally, a new catalytic approach for the formation of this high&#8208;value cationic vinylphosphonium has been established.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Activity&#8208;Based Sensing of Ascorbate by Using Copper&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Bond Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>
Probing ascorbate: A new, activity&#8208;based sensing strategy was developed for the highly selective detection of ascorbate. A copper(II) complex was designed to be activated by ascorbate to effect an oxidative bond cleavage and release an emissive fluorophore for a turn&#8208;on signal. The new ascorbate probes can be applied in complex matrix including food, plasma, and live cells.







Abstract
Ascorbate is an important biological reductant and enzyme cofactor. Although direct detection through ascorbate&#8208;mediated reduction is possible, this approach suffers from poor selectivity due to the wide range of cellular reducing agents. To overcome this limitation, we leverage reduction potential of ascorbate to mediate a copper&#8208;mediated oxidative bond cleavage of ether&#8208;caged fluorophores. The copper(II) complexes supported by a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}benzylamine or a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}(2&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amine ligand were identified as an ascorbate responsive unit and their reaction with ascorbate yields a copper&#8208;based oxidant that enables rapid benzylic oxidation and the release of an ether&#8208;caged dye (coumarin or fluorescein). The copper&#8208;mediated bond cleavage is specific to ascorbate and the trigger can be readily derivatized for tuning photophysical properties of the probes. The probes were successfully applied for the fluorometric detection of ascorbate in commercial food samples, human plasma, and serum, and within live cells by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.

      <title>Engineering Bifunctional Host Materials of Sulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Based on Nitrogen&#8208;Enriched Polyacrylonitrile for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is delicately engineered as a bifunctional host material to simultaneously solve the problems of the shuttle effect in the cathode and lithium dendrite in the anode, which leads to improved electrochemical performances of both electrodes. Due to excellent bifunctional host characteristics, the full cell demonstrates an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) still suffer from the shuttle effect on the cathode and the lithium dendrite on the anode. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is developed into a bifunctional host material to simultaneously address the challenges faced on both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode in LSBs. For the sulfur cathode, PAN is bonded with sulfur to produce sulfurized PAN (SPAN) to avoid the shuttle effect. The SPAN is accommodated into a conductive 3D CNTs&#8208;wrapped carbon foam to prepare a self&#8208;supporting cathode, which improves the electronic and ionic conductivity, and buffers the volume expansion. Thereby, it delivers reversible capacity, superb rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. For the Li&#8208;metal anode, PAN aerogel is carbonized to give macroporous N&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked carbon nanofiber that behaves as a lithiophilic host to regulate Li plating and suppress the growth of Li dendrite. Combining the improvements for both the cathode and anode realizes a remarkable long&#8208;term cyclability (765&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles) in a full cell. It provides new opportunity to propel the practical application of advanced LSBs.

      <title>Solution&#8208;based, anion&#8208;doping of Li4Ti5O12 Nanoflowers 
for Lithium&#8208;ion Battery Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Solution&#8208;based, anionic doping represents a convenient strategy with which to improve upon the conductivity of candidate anode materials such as Li  4  Ti  5  O  12  (LTO). As such, we have primarily devised novel synthetic hydrothermally&#8208;inspired protocols, aimed at the large scale production of unique halogen&#8208;doped, micron&#8208;scale, three&#8208;dimensional, hierarchical LTO flower&#8208;like motifs. Though we have explored F doping, we have concentrated herein primarily on the use of Cl dopants. Several experimental variables, such as dopant amount, lithium hydroxide concentration, and titanium butoxide purity, were probed and perfected. Furthermore, the Cl doping process did not damage the intrinsic LTO morphology. Our analysis, based on interpreting a compilation of SEM, XRD, XPS, and TEM&#8208;EDS results, was used to determine an optimized dopant concentration of Cl. Electrochemical tests demonstrated an increased capacity via cycling of 12% for a doped sample as compared with pristine LTO. Moreover, the Cl&#8208;doped LTO sample described in this study exhibited the highest discharge capacity yet reported for this material at 120 mAh/g, obtained with an observed rate of 2C. Overall, these data suggest that the Cl dopant likely enhances not only the ion transport capabilities but also the overall electrical conductivity of our as&#8208;prepared structures. To help explain these favorable findings, theoretical DFT calculations were used to postulate that the electronic conductivity and Li diffusion were likely improved by partially reducing Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  and widening the Li migration channel.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Cationic Intermediates for the Synthesis of Chiral N,O&#8208;Acetals</title>
      <dc:description>Over a half century, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation has been mainly focused on neutral and readily&#8208;prepared unsaturated substrates. While the addition of molecular hydrogen to C=C, C=N and C=O bonds was a well&#8208;studied paradigm, the asymmetric hydrogenation of cationic species was an underdeveloped area. In this research, we were seeking for a breakthrough in asymmetric hydrogenation to include cationic intermediates as the target and therefore expecting to apply this powerful tool in the construction of challenging chiral molecules. Under an acidic condition, both N &#8208; or O &#8208;acetyl salicylamides undergo cyclization to generate cationic intermediates, which was subsequentially reduced by an iridium or rhodium hydride complex. N,O &#8208;acetals were synthesized with remarkably high enantioselectivity. This catalytic strategy exhibited high efficiency (TON up to 4400) and high chemoselectivities. Mechanistic studies supported the hypothesis that a cationic intermediate was in situ formed and hydrogenated afterwards. A catalytic cycle was proposed with the hydride transfer from iridium complex to the cationic sp 2 &#8208;carbon being the rate determining step. A steric map of the catalyst was depicted to illustrate the chiral environment and a QSSR analysis showed how the enantiomeric induction was achieved in this chemical transformation.</dc:description>

      <title>Boron effect on sugar&#8208;based organogelators</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of several alkylglucosides with phenyl boronic acid permitted an easy access to a series of alkylglucoside phenyl boronate derivatives. This type of compounds has structures similar to the known benzylidene glucoside organogelators except the presence of a boronate function in place of the acetal one. Low to very low concentrations of these amphiphilic molecules produced gelation of several organic solvents. The rheological properties of the corresponding soft materials characterized them as elastic solids. They were further characterized by SEM to obtain more information on their morphologies and by SAXS to determine the type of self&#8208;assembly involved within the gels. The sensitivity of the boronate function towards hydrolysis was also investigated. We demonstrated that a small amount of water (5% v/v) was sufficient to disrupt organogels leading to the original alkylglucoside and phenyl boronic acid; an important difference with the stable benzylidene&#8208;based organogelators. Such water sensitive boronated organogelators could be suitable substances for the preparation of smart soft material for topic drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of a Partial Structure from Arabinogalactan and its Application for Allergy&#8208;Prevention</title>
      <dc:description>Arabinogalactan, a microheterogeneous polysaccharide occurring in plants, is known for its allergy&#8208;protective activity, which could potentially be used for preventive allergy treatment. New treatment options are highly desirable, especially in a preventive manner, due to the constant rise of atopic diseases worldwide. The structural origin of the allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan is, however, still unclear and isolation of the polysaccharide is not feasible for pharmaceutical applications due to a variation of the activity of the natural product and contaminations with endotoxins. Therefore, a pentasaccharide partial structure was selected for total synthesis and subsequently coupled to a carrier protein to form a neoglycoconjugate. The allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan could be reproduced with the partial structure in subsequent in vivo experiments. This is the first example of a successful simplification of arabinogalactan with a single partial structure while retaining its allergy&#8208;preventive potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzymatic Insertion of Lipids Increases Membrane Tension for Inhibiting Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Although lipids contribute to cancer drug resistance, it is challenging to target diverse range of lipids. Here we show enzymatically inserting exceedingly simple synthetic lipids into membranes for increasing membrane tension and selectively inhibiting drug resistant cancer cells. The lipid, formed by conjugating dodecylamine to D&#8208;phosphotyrosine, self&#8208;assembles to form micelles. Enzymatic dephosphorylation of the micelles inserts the lipids into membranes and increases membrane tension. This transformation of micelles effectively inhibits a drug resistant glioblastoma cell (T98G) or a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell (HCC1937), without inducing acquired drug resistance. Moreover, the enzymatic reaction of the micelles promotes the accumulation of the lipids in the membranes of subcellular organelles (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and mitochondria), thus activating multiple regulated cell death pathways. This work, as the first report that a multiple step molecular process increases membrane tension for inhibiting cancer cells, illustrates a new and powerful supramolecular approach for antagonizing difficult drug targets.</dc:description>

      <title>Triarylborane Appended Anils and Boranils: Solid State Emission, Mechanofluorochromism and Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the design, synthesis, optical and mechanoluminescence properties of a series of conjugates having covalently linked triarylborane (TAB) and anils/boranils (TAB&#8208;anils:  1a  &#8208;  3a  and TAB&#8208;boranils:  1  &#8208;  3  ). The electronic interaction between TAB and anils/boranils in  1a  &#8208;  3a  and  1  &#8208;  3  were finetuned by changing the position of the boryl moiety on the phenyl spacer connecting TAB and anils/boranils units. Boryl moiety at the  meta  position (  1a  ) of the phenyl spacer stabilizes enolic form (E&#8208;OH) while boryl moiety at the  para  position (  2a  and  3a  ) stabilize keto form (Z&#8208;NH) in the solid state. However, in solutions state  1a  ,  2a  and  3a  exhibit keto&#8208;enol tautomerism in both ground and excited states. Both TAB coupled anils and boranils show red shifted absorption compared to the model compounds  4a  and  4,  devoid of TAB moiety indicating the effective participation of empty  p  &#8208;orbital on boron center. These compounds show vivid emission in solid&#8208;state and the luminescence color tunability was realized. Compounds  1  and  2  showed the fluorescence variations in response to the external stimuli such as mechanical grinding. TAB coupled boranil complexes exhibited the phosphorescence emission (77 K) with a long lifetime (18&#8208;46 ms). The detailed optical properties for TAB coupled anils (  1a  &#8208;  3a  ) and boranils (  1  &#8208;  3  ) are rationalized in the context of quantum mechanical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>A Lacunary Polyoxovanadate Precursor and Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Sandwiched Derivatives for Catalytic Oxidation of Sulfides</title>
      <dc:description>
New topology of polyoxovanadates: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV10O28(SeO3)3]8&#8722; ({Se4V10}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se4V10)2M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn). Such new TM&#8208;derivatives can efficiently catalysis heterogeneous oxidation of sulfides in high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions.

      <title>Anthranoxides as Highly Reactive Arynophiles for the Synthesis of Triptycenes</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient method to synthesize triptycenes through the reaction of benzynes and anthranoxides, which are electron&#8208;rich and readily prepared from the corresponding anthrones, is reported. Using this method, 1,9&#8208;syn&#8208;substituted triptycenes were regioselectively obtained employing 3&#8208;methoxybenzynes. This method was also applied to synthesize pentiptycenes. A DFT study revealed that the cycloaddition of lithium anthranoxide and benzyne proceeds stepwise. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002065).

      <dc:description>
The carbaporphyrinoid rollercoaster: Diphenanthrioctaphyrin(1.1.1.0.1.1.1.0) exists as two locked figure&#8208;eight isomers that demonstrate multiple conformational rearrangements and anion&#8208;binding events upon protonation. Formation of one of the final dications is accompanied by an inclusion of a complex anion within the cavity yielding a pseudorotaxane&#8208;like complex. Multiple conformational transformations of the macrocycle remind the movement of a rollercoaster along a complex track constructed of loops and turns, providing the expanded carbaporphyrinoid amusement park.

      <dc:description>
Monohydride&#8208;dichloro rhodium(III) complexes bearing chiral diphosphine ligands stand as novel candidates for asymmetric hydrogenation of non&#8208;functionalized olefins. The sterically hindered chiral diphosphine ligand, (S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS, made it possible to isolate the rhodium(III) complex as a mononuclear complex which was confirmed by XRD analysis and DOSY NMR analysis. The novel monohydride rhodium(III) complex showed much higher enantioselectivity than classical dihydride rhodium systems on asymmetric hydrogenation of non&#8208;functionalized olefins.
