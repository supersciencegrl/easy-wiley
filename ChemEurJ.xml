         <title>seco&#8208;Labdanes: A Study of Terpenoid Structural Diversity Resulting from Biosynthetic C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond cleavage in synthesis: This review examines the isolation, bioactivity, and total synthesis of seco&#8208;labdane diterpenoids&#8212;a class of diterpenoid arising from C&#8722;C bond cleavage events. In doing so, the importance of biosynthetic C&#8722;C bond cleavage to the generation of structural diversity is highlighted.







Abstract
The cleavage of a C&#8722;C bond is a complexity generating process, which complements oxidation and cyclisation events in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. This process leads to increased structural diversity in a cluster of related secondary metabolites by modification of the parent carbocyclic core. In this review, we highlight the diversifying effect of C&#8722;C bond cleavage by examining the literature related to seco&#8208;labdanes&#8212;a class of diterpenoids arising from such C&#8722;C bond cleavage events.

Sic et simpliciter: A one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;reaction approach, starting from commercially available reagents, is developed to access 5&#8208;amino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid esters, working under metal&#8208;free conditions and using benign solvents. The novel sequence affords, for the first time, this class of functionalized cyclic amidines, bearing three stereocenters, in good to high overall yield and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A novel three&#8208;step four&#8208;transformation approach to highly functionalized 5&#8208;amino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid esters, starting from commercially available phenylsulfonylacetonitrile, aldehydes, and N&#8208;(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert&#8208;butyl ester, was developed. The one&#8208;pot strategy delivered this class of amidines bearing, for the first time, three contiguous stereocenters, in good to high yield and diastereoselectivity. The entire sequence was carried out using diethyl carbonate and 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran as benign solvents, operating under metal&#8208;free conditions. The process could be conveniently scaled&#8208;up, and the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated.

         <title>Bifunctional Europium(III) and Niobium(V)&#8208;Containing Saponite Clays for the Simultaneous Optical Detection and Catalytic Oxidative Abatement of Blister Chemical Warfare Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbV/EuIII&#8208;containing saponite materials were successfully applied for the first time to the dual optical detection and catalytic oxidative abatement in water, at room temperature of (2&#8208;chloroethyl)ethyl sulfide (CEES), a simulant of the blister chemical warfare agent, sulfur mustard.







Abstract
For the first time, the co&#8208;presence in the saponite structure of luminescent EuIII and catalytic NbV metal sites was exploited for the simultaneous detection and catalytic abatement of sulfur&#8208;containing blister chemical warfare agents. Metal centers were introduced in structural positions of the saponite (in the interlayer space or inside the inorganic framework) following two different synthetic methodologies. The functionalized saponites were able to reveal the presence of a sulfur mustard simulant (2&#8208;chloroethyl)ethyl sulfide (CEES) after few seconds of contact time and more than 80&#8201;% of the substrate was catalytically decomposed after 24&#8197;h in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Homogeneous Reforming of Aqueous Ethylene Glycol to Glycolic Acid and Pure Hydrogen Catalyzed by Pincer&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes Capable of Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reforming of aqueous ethylene glycol to glycolic acid and hydrogen is described. A plausible reaction mechanism, involving metal&#8211;ligand cooperation is proposed and supported by stoichiometric reactions, NMR studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies.







Abstract
Glycolic acid is a useful and important &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid that has broad applications. Herein, the homogeneous ruthenium catalyzed reforming of aqueous ethylene glycol to generate glycolic acid as well as pure hydrogen gas, without concomitant CO2 emission, is reported. This approach provides a clean and sustainable direction to glycolic acid and hydrogen, based on inexpensive, readily available, and renewable ethylene glycol using 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst. In&#8208;depth mechanistic experimental and computational studies highlight key aspects of the PNNH&#8208;ligand framework involved in this transformation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Amphiphilic AABB Phthalocyanines: Nanostructures for Efficient Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic nanoparticles formed by self&#8208;assembly of binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked amphiphilic AABB ZnII phthalocyanines in water are explored as new models for the efficient delivery of photosensitizers to bacteria. Photo&#8208;inactivation studies show an unusually high activity of the nanoparticles in killing the Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine (pc)&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral ZnIIPcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents). They contain differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous media and have proved efficient in the photo&#8208;inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The average size of the nanoparticles was determined by substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a nonsubstituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than the octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PSs present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective at killing both types of strain, showing an outstanding photo&#8208;inactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli.

Thus, &lt;b&gt;PS&#8208;1&lt;/b&gt;, presenting a nonsubstituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than the octyl&#8208;functionalized &lt;b&gt;PS&#8208;2&lt;/b&gt;. Although both PSs present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of &lt;b&gt;PS&#8208;1&lt;/b&gt; are more effective at killing both types of strain, showing an outstanding photo&#8208;inactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning Tetrazole Photochemistry for Protein Ligation and Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazole&#8208;based photolabelling of antibodies for PET. Tuning the photophysical properties of di&#8208;aryl tetrazole scaffolds can induce a bathochromic shift in the photoactivation window that facilitates protein ligation at long wavelengths. Photoactivatable metal binding chelates functionalised with a tetrazole are developed for applications in light&#8208;induced photoradiolabelling of monoclonal antibodies for positron emission tomography.







Abstract
Photochemistry provides a wide range of alternative reagents that hold potential for use in bimolecular functionalisation of proteins. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of metal ion binding chelates derivatised with disubstituted tetrazoles for the photoradiochemical labelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The photophysical properties of tetrazoles featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395&#8197;nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and the aza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with 89Zr, 64Cu and 68Ga radionuclides. DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with 89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based binding assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable in vitro retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.

         <title>Photocatalytic Giese&#8208;Type Reaction with Alkylsilicates Bearing C,O&#8208;Bidentate Ligands</title>

Shine on me! Photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reactions with alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as alkyl radical precursors are reported. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals, but also elusive methyl radicals, can be generated under the present reaction system. This radical generation process is investigated by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Herein, a photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reaction with alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as stable alkyl radical precursors has been reported. The alkylsilicates were prepared in one step from organometallic reagents. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals, but also elusive methyl radicals, could be generated by using the present reaction system. The generated radicals were trapped by electron&#8208;deficient olefins bearing various functional groups to give the desired alkyl adducts. The silicon byproduct can be recovered after the photoreaction. The radical generation process was investigated by theoretical calculations, which provided an insight into the facile generation of methyl radicals from methylsilicate bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands.

         <title>Fluorogenic squaraine dendrimers for background&#8208;free imaging of integrin receptors in cancer cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (~2,300,000 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (~25%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3 nM) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.</dc:description>

These novel types of pre&#8208;organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an ortho&#8208;phenylene linker, are capable of activating H&#8208;H, C&#8208;H, N&#8208;H, O&#8208;H, Si&#8208;H, B&#8208;H and C=O bonds.  4  and  5  deprotonated terminal alkynes to form the zwitterionic borates 1&#8208;(RC&#8801;C&#8208;BR  2  )&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]&#8208;C  6  H  4  (R = Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH  2  and pyrrolidine, to generate the adducts 1&#8208;(R  2  HN&#8594;BR  2  )&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]&#8208;C  6  H  4  , where the N&#8208;H functionality is activated by intramolecular H&#8208;bond interactions. In addition,  5  was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H  2  CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields.

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family.&#160; In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation&#160; of previously unrecognized sulfur tetra hydride ( C 4v &#8208;symmetric SH 4 ) from &#160;hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) on the ground state potential energy surface.&#160; The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH 4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF 4 ( C 2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. &#160;The distressed character of SH 4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH 4 ) n and mixed (SH 4 &#183;&#183;&#183;H 2 S) n composition. &#160;We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH 4 &#183;&#183;&#183;H 2 S) n &#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH 3 &#8221; stoichiometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing multiconfigurational states by spectroscopy:&#160;The cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS spectra of CeO2  and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with&#160;ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed&#160;spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the&#160;relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron&#160;occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO  2  and cerocene&#160;exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction&#160;configurational&#160;composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated&#160;GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements&#160;using peak areas&#160;(nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3&#8208;edge is&#160;rationalized from the perspective&#160;of the relaxed orbitals for the GS and core ESs. The&#160;states&#160;underlying the different peaks&#160;differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1  vs. 4f0  sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene&#160;spectral peaks is associated with&#160;4f2  sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in&#160;terms of Ce IV and III ONs, as long assumed, with Ce II states additionally appearing in the&#160;cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the&#160;accuracy of the conventional&#160;approach to determining  nf  &#160;from Ce L3&#8208;edge, imitations are highlighted in terms of the&#160;ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states.&#160;The need to determine the origins of  nf  &#160;by calculations&#160;is stressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N  2  adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8208;0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH  3  production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

Efficient TADF sensitizer: Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials having fast reverse intersystem crossing rate were developed for TADF sensitizer. Among these, two TADF materials include tert&#8208;butyl blocking group to manage the Dexter energy transfer. TADF sensitized fluorescent devices with blocking groups show high maximum external quantum efficiencies. In addition, the device operational lifetime is extended by adding blocking groups.







Abstract
In this work, a design approach of three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to extend the device lifetime of the TADF sensitized fluorescent devices was studied. Three TADF materials, 5&#8208;{4,6&#8208;bis[4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl}&#8208;2&#8208;(10,15&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,15&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;diindolo[3,2&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;c]carbazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)benzonitrile (tTCNTruX), 4&#8208;[3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;(10,15&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,15&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;diindolo[3,2&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;c]carbazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl]&#8208;2,6&#8208;diphenylpyrimidine&#8208;5&#8208;carbonitrile (PCNTruX) and 4&#8208;(4&#8208;{10,15&#8208;bis[4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl]&#8208;10,15&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;diindolo[3,2&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;c]carbazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl}&#8208;3&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diphenylpyrimidine&#8208;5&#8208;carbonitrile (PCNtTruX), were synthesized as sensitizers for TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. The two tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX TADF emitters were designed to have Dexter energy transfer with blocking groups either in the donor or acceptor unit of the donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type TADF sensitizer. The TADF materials showed small singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting and a high reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate for effective sensitization of the fluorescent emission of the fluorescent emitter. tTCNTruX&#8208; and PCNtTruX&#8208;sensitized fluorescent devices showed maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17.7&#8201;% and 11.5&#8201;% in the yellow and red devices, respectively, which were higher than those of TADF&#8208;sensitized devices with the corresponding TADF sensitizer without a blocking group. Moreover, the device lifetime was also extended by employing the tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitizers. This work demonstrated that the tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitizers are effective to improve the maximum EQE and device lifetime of TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescent devices.

An unprecedented aromatic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of arylpropargylammonium salts, generated in situ from arynes and tertiary propargylamines, has been established, delivering structurally diverse 2&#8208;propargylanilines. These further cyclize in the presence of aluminum chloride to afford multisubstituted indoles.







Abstract
The charge&#8208;accelerated aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of ammonium salts serves as a key step in the construction of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. However, much less attention has been paid to the aromatic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement than to the aliphatic one. Herein, we report an unprecedented aromatic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of arylpropargylammonium salts, generated in situ from arynes and tertiary propargylamines, delivering structurally diverse 2&#8208;propargylanilines in moderate to good yields with high regioselectivity. This rearrangement proceeds in the absence of strong bases or transition metals, is compatible with moisture and air, tolerates a wide variety of functional groups, and is amenable to forming 11&#8208; to 13&#8208;membered heterocycles with a triple bond. The 2&#8208;propargylaniline products were treated with aluminum chloride in ethanol to afford multisubstituted indoles in moderate to excellent yields. Finally, a series of deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments was performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

On target: A compound (NSC116565) from the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI&#8208;DTP) chemical library shows strong inhibition of Mycobacterium&#8197;tuberculosis (Mtb) ketol&#8211;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), a potential target for antituberculosis agents. NSC116565 competitively binds to the active site of KARI in the absence or presence of the NADPH cofactor and inhibits the growth of virulent and avirulent Mtb.







Abstract
New drugs aimed at novel targets are urgently needed to combat the increasing rate of drug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis (TB). Herein, the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI&#8208;DTP) chemical library was screened against a promising new target, ketol&#8211;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched&#8208;chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway. From this library, 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylthiazolo[4,5&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;5,7(4H,6H)&#8208;dione (NSC116565) was identified as a potent time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of Mycobacterium&#8197;tuberculosis (Mt) KARI with a Ki of 95.4&#8197;nm. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies showed that this inhibitor bound to MtKARI in the presence and absence of the cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which was confirmed by crystal structures of the compound in complex with closely related Staphylococcus&#8197;aureus KARI. It is also shown that NSC116565 inhibits the growth of H37Ra and H37Rv strains of Mt with MIC50 values of 2.93 and 6.06&#8197;&#956;m, respectively. These results further validate KARI as a TB drug target and show that NSC116565 is a promising lead for anti&#8208;TB drug development.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Functionalized Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Destruction of Escherichia coli under Low&#8208;Power Light Irradiation</title>

Water, water everywhere: The efficiency of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) in photocatalytic water disinfection is plagued by its rapid charge recombination and sluggish electron&#8208;transfer kinetics. Protonation of g&#8208;C3N4 can enhance its conductivity and provide a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the delocalization of electrons. Consequently, protonated g&#8208;C3N4 demonstrated 100&#8201;% destruction of E. coli within 4&#8197;h under low&#8208;power household light irradiation.







Abstract
Universal access to clean water has been a global ambition over the years. Photocatalytic water disinfection through advanced oxidation processes has been regarded as one of the promising methods for breaking down microbials. The forefront of this research focuses on the application of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for disinfection to prevent secondary pollution. Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has achieved instant attention as a metal&#8208;free and visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalyst for various energy and environmental applications. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of g&#8208;C3N4 is still affected by its rapid charge recombination and sluggish electron&#8208;transfer kinetics. In this contribution, two&#8208;dimensionally protonated g&#8208;C3N4 was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for water treatment and demonstrated 100&#8201;% of Escherichia coli within 4&#8197;h under irradiation with a 23&#8197;W light bulb. The introduction of protonation can modulate the surface charge of g&#8208;C3N4; this enhances its conductivity and provides a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the delocalization of electrons. This work highlights the potential of conjugated polymers in antibacterial application.

         <title>An Aldehyde Responsive, Cleavable Linker for Glucose Responsive Insulins</title>

463 Million people live with diabetes of which approximately 10&#8201;% have type 1 diabetes. A glucose responsive insulin that responds to fluctuations in blood glucose concentrations has remained an elusive goal for decades. Here we describe the chemical development of hydrazones and thiazolidines that are cleavable in glucose concentration dependent manner. These were used to construct unprecedented glucose responsive insulins.







Abstract
A glucose responsive insulin (GRI) that responds to changes in blood glucose concentrations has remained an elusive goal. Here we describe the development of glucose cleavable linkers based on hydrazone and thiazolidine structures. We developed linkers with low levels of spontaneous hydrolysis but increased level of hydrolysis with rising concentrations of glucose, which demonstrated their glucose responsiveness in vitro. Lipidated hydrazones and thiazolidines were conjugated to the LysB29 side&#8208;chain of HI by pH&#8208;controlled acylations providing GRIs with glucose responsiveness confirmed in vitro for thiazolidines. Clamp studies showed increased glucose infusion at hyperglycemic conditions for one GRI indicative of a true glucose response. The glucose responsive cleavable linker in these GRIs allow changes in glucose levels to drive the release of active insulin from a circulating depot. We have demonstrated an unprecedented, chemically responsive linker concept for biopharmaceuticals.

A key step during the biosynthesis of cytochalasans is a proposed Knoevenagel condensation to form the pyrrolone core, enabling the subsequent 4+2 cycloaddition reaction that results in the characteristic octahydroisoindolone motif of all cytochalasans. In this work, we investigate the role of the highly conserved &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase enzymes PyiE and ORFZ during the biosynthesis of pyrichalasin H and the ACE1 metabolite, respectively, using gene knockout and complementation techniques. Using synthetic aldehyde models we demonstrate that the Knoevenagel condensation proceeds spontaneously but results in the 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer, rather than the required 1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer. Taken together our results suggest that the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase enzymes are essential for first ring cyclisation, but the precise nature of the intermediates remains to be determined.

         <title>A Synthetic Strategy for Cofacial Porphyrin&#8208;Based Homo&#8208; and Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 3047-3054, February 10, 2021. </description>

Simple route to dimeric complexes: Three different types of covalently linked metalloporphyrin dimers were synthesized. The monomers were synthesized sequentially and can be filled with metals before linking. As a result, different heterobimetallic systems can be made. Depending on the metals M1 and M2 used (M=Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd), a wide range of potentially catalytically active species can be prepared, such as analogues of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.







Abstract
We present a straightforward and generally applicable synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic porphyrin complexes. The protocol allows the synthesis of unsymmetrical aryl&#8208;based meso&#8208;meso as well as &#946;&#8208;meso&#8208;linked porphyrins. Our method significantly increases the overall yield for the published compound known as o&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bisporphyrin (OBBP) by a factor of 6.8. Besides the synthesis of 16 novel homobimetallic complexes containing MnIII, FeIII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, and PdII, we achieved the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of an unsymmetrical cofacial benzene&#8208;linked porphyrin dimer containing both planar&#8208;chiral enantiomers of a NiII2 complex. Additionally, this new methodology allows access to heterobimetallic complexes such as the FeIII&#8208;NiII containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase active site analogue. The isolated species were investigated by various techniques, including ion mobility spectrometry, DFT calculations, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. This allowed us to probe the influence of interplane distance on Soret band splitting.

Importance of microenvironment: By using solid&#8208;state molecular organometallic (SMOM) techniques, the &#963;&#8208;alkane complex [Rh(tBu2PCH2CH2CH2PtBu2)(&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;C7H12)][BArF4], in which the alkane binds through two exo&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Rh interactions, is synthesized and structurally characterized. This is different from the analogous complex with PCy2 groups. Subtle differences in the microenvironment, as encoded by the diene precursor complex, are shown to determine the selectivity of alkane binding.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal solid&#8208;state molecular organometallic (SMOM) techniques are used for the synthesis and structural characterization of the &#963;&#8208;alkane complex [Rh(tBu2PCH2CH2CH2PtBu2)(&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;C7H12)][BArF4] (ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3), in which the alkane (norbornane) binds through two exo&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Rh interactions. In contrast, the bis&#8208;cyclohexyl phosphine analogue shows endo&#8208;alkane binding. A comparison of the two systems, supported by periodic DFT calculations, NCI plots and Hirshfeld surface analyses, traces this different regioselectivity to subtle changes in the local microenvironment surrounding the alkane ligand. A tertiary periodic structure supporting a secondary microenvironment that controls binding at the metal site has parallels with enzymes. The new &#963;&#8208;alkane complex is also a catalyst for solid/gas 1&#8208;butene isomerization, and catalyst resting states are identified for this.

         <title>Effect of Stereochemistry on Chirality and Gelation Properties of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>

Mirror images: For C2&#8208;symmetrical dipeptide&#8208;based derivatives bearing various amino acid sequences and different chiralities, their supramolecular chirality is only determined by the amino acid adjacent to the benzene core and is irrespective of the absolute configuration of the C&#8208;terminal amino acid.







Abstract
Although chiral nanostructures have been fabricated at various structural levels, the transfer and amplification of chirality from molecules to supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are still puzzling, especially for heterochiral molecules. Herein, four series of C2&#8208;symmetrical dipeptide&#8208;based derivatives bearing various amino acid sequences and different chiralities are designed and synthesized. The transcription and amplification of molecular chirality to supramolecular assemblies are achieved. The results show that supramolecular chirality is only determined by the amino acid adjacent to the benzene core, irrespective of the absolute configuration of the C&#8208;terminal amino acid. In addition, molecular chirality also has a significant influence on the gelation behavior. For the diphenylalanine&#8208;based gelators, the homochiral gelators can be gelled through a conventional heating&#8211;cooling process, whereas heterochiral gelators form translucent stable gels under sonication. The racemic gels possess higher mechanical properties than those of the pure enantiomers. All of these results contribute to an increasing knowledge over control of the generation of specific chiral supramolecular structures and the development of new optimized strategies to achieve functional supramolecular organogels through heterochiral and racemic systems.

&lt;p&gt;Although chiral nanostructures have been fabricated at various structural levels, the transfer and amplification of chirality from molecules to supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are still puzzling, especially for heterochiral molecules. Herein, four series of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;symmetrical dipeptide&#8208;based derivatives bearing various amino acid sequences and different chiralities are designed and synthesized. The transcription and amplification of molecular chirality to supramolecular assemblies are achieved. The results show that supramolecular chirality is only determined by the amino acid adjacent to the benzene core, irrespective of the absolute configuration of the C&#8208;terminal amino acid. In addition, molecular chirality also has a significant influence on the gelation behavior. For the diphenylalanine&#8208;based gelators, the homochiral gelators can be gelled through a conventional heating&#8211;cooling process, whereas heterochiral gelators form translucent stable gels under sonication. The racemic gels possess higher mechanical properties than those of the pure enantiomers. All of these results contribute to an increasing knowledge over control of the generation of specific chiral supramolecular structures and the development of new optimized strategies to achieve functional supramolecular organogels through heterochiral and racemic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Push&#8211;Pull Bisnaphthyridylamine Supramolecular Nanoparticles: Polarity&#8208;Induced Aggregation and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 3039-3046, February 10, 2021. </description>

Emissive bisnaphthyridylamine derivatives (BNA&#8208;X) have been prepared. In MeOH/water mixtures, the BNA&#8208;X containing alkyl groups or a phenyl ring showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) depending on the water content. The AIEE behavior was based on the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) with small polydispersity indices. In the presence of pyrene, the NPs showed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).







Abstract
Emissive push&#8211;pull&#8208;type bisnaphthyridylamine derivatives (BNA&#8208;X: X=Me, Et, Bzl, Ph, BuBr, and BuTEMPO) aggregate in aqueous methanol. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step emission and aggregation process is controllable by varying the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. At 2:3 MeOH/H2O, crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) occurs via formation of an emissive crystal phase, whereas, at 1:9 MeOH/H2O, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) occurs, induced by emissive supramolecular nanoparticles (NPs). For BNA&#8208;Ph, the emission quantum yield was 25 times higher in aqueous methanol than that in pure methanol. Despite the high hydrophobicity of BNA&#8208;X (C&#8201;log&#8201;P=6.1&#8211;8.0), the spherical NPs were monodisperse (polydispersity indices &lt;0.2). Moreover, the emissive NPs exhibited fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with pyrene; however, for BNA&#8208;X bearing the TEMPO radical (BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO), no FRET was observed because of quenching. In particular, the BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO NPs have a slow rotational correlation time (1.3&#8197;ns), suggesting applications as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents with large relaxivity.

         <title>Isolation of a 16&#960;&#8208;Electrons 1,4&#8208;Diphosphinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide with a Planar C4P2 Ring</title>

Aromatic (I) and antiaromatic (II) C4P2 ring systems derived from an anionic dicarbene (ADC) have been reported. Electronic structures of I and II have been analyzed by NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and corroborated by computational calculations. The ACID (anisotropy of induced current density) plot of II shows that the ring current in the central C4P2 ring is paratropic (antiaromatic) whereas the peripheral C3N2 rings exhibit two local diatropic ring currents. The ACID plot of the aromatic system II unveils a global diatropic current on the periphery of the C3N2 and C4P2 rings.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first 1,4&#8208;diphosphinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADCPh)P]2 (5&#8208;Ph) (ADCPh=PhC{(NDipp)C}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) derived from an anionic dicarbene (ADCPh) as a red crystalline solid. Compound 5&#8208;Ph containing a 16&#960;&#8208;electron planar fused&#8208;tricyclic ring system was obtained by the 4e reduction of [(ADCPh)PCl2]2 (4&#8208;Ph) with Mg (or KC8) in a quantitative yield. Experimental and computational results imply that the central 8&#960;&#8208;electrons C4P2 ring of 5&#8208;Ph, which is fused between two 6&#960;&#8208;electrons C3N2 aromatic rings, is antiaromatic. Thus, each of the phosphorus atoms of 5&#8208;Ph has two electron&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs, one in a p&#8208;type orbital is in conjugation with the C=C bonds of the C4P2 ring, while the second resides in a &#963;&#8208;symmetric orbital. This can be shown with the gold complex [(ADCPh)P(AuCl)2]2 (6&#8208;Ph) obtained by reacting 5&#8208;Ph with (Me2S)AuCl. A mixture of 5&#8208;Ph and 4&#8208;Ph undergoes comproportionation in the presence of MgCl2 to form the intermediate oxidation state compound [(ADCAr)P]2(MgCl4) (7&#8208;Ph), which is an aromatic species.

Band of brothers: Conjugation of the transition&#8208;state analogue 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;didehydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetylneuraminic (DANA) to polymeric scaffolds leads to highly potent inhibitors of bacterial sialidases. Each clustered DANA on the polymers sees its inhibitory potency for S.&#8197;pneumoniae or B.&#8197;thetaiotaomicron sialidases improved by more than four orders of magnitude. This extends the multivalent concept to this important class of enzymes.







Abstract
Bacterial sialidases (SA) are validated drug targets expressed by common human pathogens such as Streptococcus&#8197;pneumoniae, Vibrio&#8197;cholerae, or Clostridium&#8197;perfringens. Noncovalent inhibitors of bacterial SA capable of reaching the submicromolar level are rarely reported. In this work, multi&#8208; and polyvalent compounds are developed, based on the transition&#8208;state analogue 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;didehydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetylneuraminic (DANA). Poly&#8208;DANA inhibits the catalytic activity of SA from S.&#8197;pneumoniae (NanA) and the symbiotic microorganism B.&#8197;thetaiotaomicron (BtSA) at the picomolar and low nanomolar levels (expressed in moles of molecules and of DANA, respectively). Each DANA grafted to the polymer surpasses the inhibitory potential of the monovalent analogue by more than four orders of magnitude, which represents the highest multivalent effect reported so far for an enzyme inhibition. The synergistic interaction is shown to operate exclusively in the catalytic domain, and not in the flanked carbohydrate&#8208;binding module (CBM). These results offer interesting perspectives for the multivalent inhibition of other SA families lacking a CBM, such as viral, parasitic, or human SA.

         <title>A Xanthene&#8208;Based Mono&#8208;Anionic PON Ligand: Exploiting a Bulky, Electronically Unsymmetrical Donor in Main Group Chemistry</title>

The application of a sterically demanding mono&#8208;anionic PON ligand in gallium chemistry has been probed, revealing a highly unsymmetrical donor profile towards GaI and structural features reminiscent of one&#8208;coordinate gallium amides. Oxidation at the metal leads to a marked increase in the donor capabilities of the phosphine donor, although the transient gallanone formed by O&#8208;atom transfer still undergoes facile C&#8722;H activation across the Ga&#8722;O bond.







Abstract
The synthesis of a novel mono&#8208;anionic phosphino&#8208;amide ligand based on a xanthene backbone is reported, togetherr with the corresponding GaI complex, (PON)Ga (PON = 4&#8208;(di(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)phosphino)&#8208;5&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene). The solid&#8208;state structure of (PON)Ga (obtained from X&#8208;ray crystallography) reveals very weak O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ga and P&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ga interactions, consistent with a R2NGa fragment which closely resembles those found in one&#8208;coordinate amidogallium systems. Strong N&#8208;to&#8208;Ga &#960; donation from the amido substituent is reflected in a very short N&#8722;Ga distance (1.961(2)&#8197;&#197;), while the P&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ga contact (3.076(1)&#8197;&#197;) is well outside the sum of the respective covalent radii. While the donor properties of the PON ligand towards GaI are highly unsymmetrical, oxidation to GaIII leads to much stronger coordination of the pendant phosphine as shown by P&#8722;Ga distances which are up to 20&#8201;% shorter. From a steric perspective, the PON ligand is shown to be significantly bulkier than related &#946;&#8208;diketiminate systems, a finding consistent with reactions of (PON)Ga towards O&#8208;atom sources that proceed without oligomerization. Despite this, the enhanced P&#8208;donor properties brought about by oxidation at gallium are not sufficient to quench the reactivity of the highly polar Ga&#8722;O unit. Instead, intramolecular benzylic C&#8722;H activation is observed across the Ga&#8722;O bond of a transient gallanone intermediate.

         <title>Double Orthogonal Click Reactions for the Development of Antimicrobial Peptide Nanotubes</title>

Double clicked amphipathic cyclic peptides assemble in bacteria membranes to form polymeric supramolecular nanotubes, conferring them antimicrobial properties.







Abstract
A new class of amphipathic cyclic peptides, which assemble in bacteria membranes to form polymeric supramolecular nanotubes giving them antimicrobial properties, is described. The method is based on the use of two orthogonal clickable transformations to incorporate different hydrophobic or hydrophilic moieties in a simple, regioselective, and divergent manner. The resulting cationic amphipathic cyclic peptides described in this article exhibit strong antimicrobial properties with a broad therapeutic window. Our studies suggest that the active form is the nanotube resulted from the parallel stacking of the cyclic peptide precursors. Several techniques, CD, FTIR, fluorescence, and STEM, among others, confirm the nanotube formation.

         <title>In Vitro and In Vivo Sequestration of Phencyclidine by Me4Cucurbit[8]uril**

Be my guest: We report the binding affinity of CB[8] and its water soluble analogue Me4CB[8] toward a panel of 10 drugs of abuse by isothermal titration calorimetry. The Me4CB[8]&#8901;PCP complex is particularly tight with Kd=2&#8197;nm in 20&#8197;mm NaH2PO4 buffered H2O at pH&#8197;7.4. Me4CB[8] is well tolerated according to the results of in vitro cytotoxicity assays and in vivo (mice) maximum tolerated dose studies. The hyperlocomotion of swiss webster mice dosed with PCP can be controlled by the (pre)treatment with Me4CB[8].







Abstract
We report investigations of the use of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) macrocycles as an antidote to counteract the in vivo biological effects of phencyclidine. We investigate the binding of CB[8] and its derivative Me4CB[8] toward ten drugs of abuse (3&#8211;9, 12&#8211;14) by a combination of 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry in phosphate buffered water. We find that the cavity of CB[8] and Me4CB[8] are able to encapsulate the 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclohexane ring system of phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine as well as the morphinan skeleton of morphine and hydromorphone with Kd values &#8804;50&#8197;nm. In vitro cytotoxicity (MTS metabolic and adenylate kinase cell death assays in HEK293 and HEPG2 cells) and in vivo maximum tolerated dose studies (Swiss Webster mice) which were performed for Me4CB[8] indicated good tolerability. The tightest host&#8901;guest pair (Me4CB[8]&#8901;PCP; Kd=2&#8197;nm) was advanced to in vivo efficacy studies. The results of open field tests demonstrate that pretreatment of mice with Me4CB[8] prevents subsequent hyperlocomotion induction by PCP and also that treatment of animals previously dosed with PCP with Me4CB[8] significantly reduces the locomotion levels.

         <title>Rational Design of High&#8208;Relaxivity EuII&#8208;Based Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Low&#8208;Oxygen Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 3114-3118, February 10, 2021. </description>

Rigid, but relaxed: EuII&#8208;containing complexes have potential use as responsive imaging agents for hypoxia. A rigid, dimetallic EuII&#8208;containing cryptate was investigated as a high&#8208;efficiency contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. NMR dispersion studies indicate that this agent exhibits higher relaxometric efficiency than either a flexible dimetallic agent or analogous small&#8208;molecule agents.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging present a promising avenue to image hypoxia. EuII&#8208;based contrast agents have a unique biologically relevant redox couple, EuII/III, that distinguishes this metal for use in hypoxia imaging. To that end, we investigated a strategy to enhance the contrast&#8208;enhancing capabilities of EuII&#8208;based cryptates in magnetic resonance imaging by controlling the rotational dynamics. Two dimetallic, EuII&#8208;containing cryptates were synthesized to test the efficacy of rigid versus flexible coupling strategies. A flexible strategy to dimerization led to a modest (114&#8201;%) increase in contrast enhancement per Eu ion (60&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K), but a rigid linking strategy led to an excellent (186&#8201;%) increase in contrast enhancement despite this compound&#8242;s having the smaller molecular mass of the two dimetallic complexes. We envision the rigid linking strategy to be useful in the future design of potent EuII&#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.

Vibronic interaction has the potential to create new fields on dynamic electronic states arising from the mixing of different electronic states by nuclear displacements. A one&#8208;dimensional rhodium&#8208;dioxolene complex undergoes drastic changes in properties with the phase transition, which are ascribable to the appearance of the mixed&#8208;valence state due to the metal&#8211;ligand electron transfer coupled with a large&#8208;amplitude vibration of Rh&#8722;Rh bonds.







Abstract
The exploration of dynamic molecular crystals is a fascinating theme for materials scientists owing to their fundamental science and potential application to molecular devices. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rhodium&#8208;dioxolene complex is reported that exhibits drastic changes in properties with the phase transition. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the room&#8208;temperature (RT) phase is in a mixed&#8208;valence state, and therefore, the drastic changes originate from the mixed&#8208;valence state appearing in the RT phase. Another notable feature is that the mean square displacements of the rhodium atoms along the 1D chain dramatically increased in the RT phase, indicating a large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8722;Rh bonds. From these results, a possible mechanism for the appearance of the mixed&#8208;valence state in the RT phase was proposed based on the thermal electron transfer from the 1D d&#8208;band to the semiquinonato &#960;* orbital coupled with the large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8722;Rh bonds.

         <title>Modulating the Electron&#8208;Donating Ability of Acridine Donor Units for Orange&#8211;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>

Full color palette: By fusing a benzothiophene unit to a diphenylacridine donor unit, a new donor moiety for orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is achieved. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on the resulting orange&#8211;red TADF emitter show good performance over a wide range of concentrations.







Abstract
The development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with orange&#8211;red emission still lags behind that of their blue, green, and yellow counterparts. Recent research to address this problem mainly focused on developing new acceptor units. There were few donor units designed especially for orange&#8211;red emitters. Herein, with benzothiophene fused to a diphenylacridine donor unit, a new donor moiety, namely, 5,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,13&#8208;dihydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;c]acridine (BTDPAc), was designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of the new donor moiety, a new TADF emitter, 2&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;yl]&#8208;6&#8208;[5,5&#8208;diphenylbenzo[4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;c]acridin&#8208;13(5H)&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[de]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI), shows an orange&#8211;red emission with a maximum at 610&#8197;nm in dilute toluene solution. Also, with the help of the diphenyl rings of the donor unit, high photoluminescence quantum yields were achieved for BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI over a wide concentration range. Consequently, an orange&#8211;red organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI achieved a high external quantum efficiency of nearly 20&#8201;%, which was comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performances with similar emission spectra.

Mimicking PS I: Light absorption, energy transfer and electron transfer were obtained in a supramolecular mimic of photosystem I.







Abstract
Photosystem I (PS I) is a transmembrane protein that assembles perpendicular to the membrane, and performs light harvesting, energy transfer, and electron transfer to a final, water&#8208;soluble electron acceptor. We present here a supramolecular model of it formed by a bicationic oligofluorene 12+ bound to the bisanionic photoredox catalyst eosin Y (EY2&#8722;) in phospholipid bilayers. According to confocal microscopy, molecular modeling, and time dependent density functional theory calculations, 12+ prefers to align perpendicularly to the lipid bilayer. In presence of EY2&#8722;, a strong complex is formed (Ka=2.1&#177;0.1&#215;106&#8201;m&#8722;1), which upon excitation of 12+ leads to efficient energy transfer to EY2&#8722;. Follow&#8208;up electron transfer from the excited state of EY2&#8722; to the water&#8208;soluble electron donor EDTA was shown via UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectroscopy. Overall, controlled self&#8208;assembly and photochemistry within the membrane provides an unprecedented yet simple synthetic functional mimic of PS I.

         <title>Efficient Imine Formation by Oxidative Coupling at Low Temperature Catalyzed by High&#8208;Surface&#8208;Area Mesoporous CeO2 with Exceptional Redox Property</title>

Mesoporous ceria catalysts: A high&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2 catalyst prepared by an organic&#8208;template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation method shows exceptional redox properties and can boost imine formation by direct oxidative coupling of primary alcohols and anilines in air atmosphere at low temperature.







Abstract
High&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2 (hsmCeO2) was prepared by a facile organic&#8208;template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation process and showed excellent catalytic activity in imine synthesis in the absence of base from primary alcohols and amines in air atmosphere at low temperature. For comparison, ordinary CeO2 and hsmCeO2 after different thermal treatments were also investigated. XRD, N2 physisorption, UV&#8208;Raman, H2 temperature&#8208;programmed reduction, O2 temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, EPR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to unravel the structural and redox properties. The hsmCeO2 calcined at 400&#8201;&#176;C shows the highest specific surface area (158&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), the highest fraction of surface coordinatively unsaturated Ce3+ ions (18.2&#8201;%), and the highest concentration of reactive oxygen vacancies (2.4&#215;1015&#8197;spins&#8201;g&#8722;1). In the model reaction of oxidative coupling of benzyl alcohol and aniline, such an exceptional redox property of the hsmCeO2 catalyst can boost benzylideneaniline formation (2.75 and 5.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;
&#8201;h&#8722;1 based on &gt;99&#8201;% yield at 60 and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively) in air with no base additives. It can also work effectively at a temperature of 30&#8201;&#176;C and in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. These are among the best results for all benchmark ceria catalysts in the literature. Moreover, the hsmCeO2 catalyst shows a wide scope towards primary alcohols and amines with good to excellent yield of imines. The influence of reaction parameters, the reusability of the catalyst, and the reaction mechanism were investigated.

         <title>Frontispiece: Temperature Induced Aggregation of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, February 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature is an influential parameter that determines the aggregation of solution processed organic semiconductors. In their Minireview on page 2908, Tao Wang et&#8197;al. summarize the temperature&#8208;induced aggregation of organic semiconductors in solution, during solution casting and upon thermal annealing post&#8208;treatment of solid&#8208;state thin films, which in turn impacts their optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Frontispiece: Synthesis of Ajoene Analogues by Novel Synthetic Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, February 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Garlic (Allium sativum) has a long history as a food ingredient and traditional medicine, and garlic extracts have been known for a very long time to exhibit a wide range of biological properties (some general structures of ajoene analogues are shown on the picture of the plant). In their Full Paper on page 3008, Wirth et al. describe the synthesis of three non&#8208;natural Allium analogues. These analogues were biologically evaluated in their ability to inhibit biofilm production in S.&#8197;Aureus and P.&#8197;Aeruginosa with promising results.

An organic solution with a push&#8211;pull&#8208;type fluorophore, which resembles the shape of a dragon in the cover image, exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement upon water addition. The cover tells the story of one dragon who strayed into the mythical world. The dragon found water, which was poured by Ganym&#275;d&#275;s; he showered and drank the water. He then flew away swiftly, shining like the star sign Aquarius. Upon increasing the water content of the aqueous solutions, transformations from the monomer to the crystals and the crystals to the nanoparticles were observed, accompanied by emission enhancement. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Karasawa et&#8197;al. on page 3039.

The excellent performance of CeO2 for imine synthesis at low temperature is highlighted in the cover image. A template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation method was used to prepare high&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2 that carries abundant surface oxygen vacancies attached to coordinatively unsaturated Ce3+ ions. These boost the activation of alcohol and O2, and allow superior catalytic stability and wide substrate scope with good to excellent imine yields. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W. Fang et&#8197;al. on page 3019.

         <title>New Promises and Opportunities in 3D Printable Inks Based on Coordination Compounds for the Creation of Objects with Multiple Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 2887-2907, February 10, 2021. </description>

Shaping the future in 3D: Metal&#8211;organic compounds with dynamic coordination bonds as new possible 3D inks with interesting properties are reviewed. Technological advances, the combination of various printing techniques, and the properties of coordination bonds lead to the creation of surprising new printable inks and objects with highly complex shapes that will close the gap between academia and industry for research into coordination compounds.







Abstract
This review focuses on the usefulness of coordination bonds to create 3D printable inks and shows how the union of chemistry and 3D technology contributes to new scientific advances, by allowing amorphous or polycrystalline solids to be transformed into objects with the desired shape for successful applications. The review clearly shows how there has been considerable increase in the manufacture of objects based on the combination of organic matrices and coordination compounds. These coordination compounds are usually homogeneously dispersed within the matrix, anchored onto a proper support or coating the printed object, without destroying their unique properties. Advances are so rapid that today it is already possible to 3D print objects made exclusively from coordination compounds without additives. The new printable inks are made mainly with nanoscale nonporous coordination polymers, metal&#8211;organic gels, or metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The highly dynamic coordination bond allows the creation of objects, which respond to stimuli, that can act as sensors and be used for drug delivery. In addition, the combination of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with 3D printing allows the adsorption or selective capacity of the object to be increased, relative to that of the original compound, which is useful in energy storage, gas separation, or water pollutant elimination. Furthermore, the presence of the metal ion can give them new properties, such as luminescence, that are useful for application in sensors or anticounterfeiting. Technological advances, the combination of various printing techniques, and the properties of coordination bonds lead to the creation of surprising, new, printable inks and objects with highly complex shapes that will close the gap between academia and industry for research into coordination compounds.

Temperature plays a vital role in determining the aggregation behavior of organic semiconductors in solution, during solution casting and in solid thin films, consequently it has an impact on optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
One important feature of organic semiconductors is their solution processability, which allows researchers to tune their aggregation states in solution and solid states and to control the processing conditions to reach desirable electronic and optoelectronic properties. Temperature is one of the most important processing parameters of organic semiconductors and has been studied extensively particularly for those conjugated small&#8208; and macro&#8208; molecules with strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation properties. This minireview summarizes the temperature&#8208;induced aggregation behaviors of organic semiconductors in solution, during solution casting and upon thermal annealing post&#8208;treatment of solid&#8208;state thin films. The influences of different aggregation states on the optoelectronic properties, in particular the photovoltaic properties, are discussed. The conclusions in this work will provide a rational guide to precisely control the aggregation states of organic semiconductors to fabricate high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Enzymatic Formation of Indolactam Scaffold by C&#8722;N Bond&#8208;Forming Cytochrome P450 Oxidases in Teleocidin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 2963-2972, February 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic formation of indolactam: This minireview focuses on recent research progress on the elucidation of the molecular basis for the P450&#8208;catalyzed remarkable intramolecular C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reaction to generate the indolactam scaffold. In addition, precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis led to formation of a series of unnatural novel molecular scaffolds including a sulfur&#8208;substituted indolactam, conformation of which is significantly different from that of indolactam&#8197;V.







Abstract
Teleocidins are potent protein kinase&#8197;C activators, and possess a unique indole&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered lactam structure. Teleocidin biosynthesis starts from the formation of a dipeptide by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), followed by oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation by a cytochrome P450 oxidase, reverse&#8208;prenylation by a prenyltransferase, and methylation&#8208;initiated terpene cyclization by a C&#8208;methyltransferase. This minireview focuses on recent research progress toward the elucidation of the molecular basis for the remarkable P450&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reaction, which is challenging in synthetic chemistry, to generate the indolactam scaffold. In addition, precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis with the promiscuous P450 enzymes led to the formation of a series of unnatural and novel molecular scaffolds, including a sulfur&#8208;substituted indolactam with a different conformation from that of indolactam&#8197;V.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Conjugated Materials via p&#8211;&#960;* Conjugation with Boron: Extending Monomers to Oligomers, Macrocycles, and Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 2973-2986, February 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of &#960;&#8208;extended organoboranes is systematically discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. An analysis of the p&#8211;&#960;* conjugation and of mutual interactions between electron&#8208;deficient boron centers across &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers allows for important structure&#8211;property relationships to be deduced. It is also illustrated how the unique properties of these boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are exploited in the field of organic optical and optoelectronic device materials.







Abstract
The extension of conjugated organoboranes from monomeric species to oligomers, macrocycles, and polymers offers access to a plethora of fascinating new materials. The p&#8211;&#960;* conjugation between empty orbitals on boron and the conjugated linkers not only affects the electronic structure and optical properties, but also enables mutual interactions between electron&#8208;deficient boron centers. The unique properties of these electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are exploited in highly luminescent materials, organic optoelectronic devices, and sensing applications.

         <title>Quantifying the Overall Efficiency of Circularly Polarized Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 2920-2934, February 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool, named circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness (BCPL), is introduced to evaluate the performances of CPL emitters. Beyond the dissymmetry factor, it takes into account quantum yields and extinction coefficients, allowing an easy and direct comparison of various CPL&#8208;emitters belonging to different chemical classes.







Abstract
An increasing number of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) molecular emitters has been developed in recent years and many of them are intended for applications in which high overall CPL efficiencies are required. In order to have a complete picture of the efficiency of a CPL emitter, dissymmetry factor (glum) is not enough. In the following we propose a new quantity, named CPL brightness (BCPL), which takes into account absorption extinction coefficient and quantum yield along with the glum factor. We calculated BCPL value for more than 180 compounds reported in the literature and we analyse data distribution for the main classes of CPL molecular emitters. This tool can be employed to put into context new CPL active compounds and to direct the choice of molecular systems for specific CPL applications.

         <title>A Switchable Catalyst Duo for Acyl Transfer Proximity Catalysis and Regulation of Substrate Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 2997-3001, February 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two switchable catalysts with differently sized cavities and allosteric control are reported that allow complementary size&#8208;selective acyl transfer in an on/off manner by modulating the effective local concentration of the substrates. Selective activation of one of the two catalysts in a mixture of reactants of similar reactivity enabled upregulation of the desired product.







Abstract
Enzymes are encoded with a gamut of information to catalyze a highly selective transformation by selecting the proper reactants from an intricate mixture of constituents. Mimicking biological machinery, two switchable catalysts with differently sized cavities and allosteric control are conceived that allow complementary size&#8208;selective acyl transfer in an on/off manner by modulating the effective local concentration of the substrates. Selective activation of one of two catalysts in a mixture of reactants of similar reactivity enabled upregulation of the desired product.

Cross&#8208;linked nanosheets: The covalent combination of different flakes of 2D materials is relatively underexplored, in particular, in the case of transition metal dichalcogenides. This work reports a simple methodology of covalent cross&#8208;linking of MoS2 through bismaleimide reagent. The MoS2&#8211;MoS2 homostructures show preferably a vertical connection, basal plane to basal plane of different flakes.







Abstract
The combination of 2D materials opens a wide range of possibilities to create new&#8208;generation structures with multiple applications. Covalently cross&#8208;linked approaches are a ground&#8208;breaking strategy for the formation of homo or heterostructures made by design. However, the covalent assembly of transition metal dichalcogenides flakes is relatively underexplored. Here, a simple covalent cross&#8208;linking method to build 2H&#8208;MoS2&#8211;MoS2 homostructures is described, using commercially available bismaleimides. These assemblies are mainly connected vertically, basal plane to basal plane, creating specific molecular sized spaces between MoS2 sheets. Therefore, this straightforward approach gives access to the controlled connection of sulfide&#8208;based 2D materials.

         <title>Calcium Hydride Catalysts for Olefin Hydrofunctionalization: Ring&#8208;Size Effect of Macrocyclic Ligands on Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 9, Page 3002-3007, February 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic ligands recognize ion size, but are rarely used to influence metal&#8208;centered catalytic activity. Calcium hydride cation [CaH]+ supported by the fifteen&#8208;membered NNNNN macrocycle Me5PACP (Me5PACP=1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentaazacyclopentadecane) catalyzes hydrogenation and hydrosilylation of unactivated olefins significantly faster than the analogous calcium catalyst containing the twelve&#8208;membered NNNN macrocycle (see figure).







Abstract
The fifteen&#8208;membered NNNNN macrocycle Me5PACP (Me5PACP=1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentaazacyclopentadecane) stabilized the [CaH]+ fragment as a dimer with a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry at calcium. The hydride complex was prepared by protonolysis of calcium dibenzyl with the conjugate acid of Me5PACP followed by hydrogenolysis or treating with nOctSiH3 of the intermediate calcium benzyl cation. The calcium hydride catalyzed the hydrogenation and hydrosilylation of unactivated olefins faster than the analogous calcium complex stabilized by the twelve&#8208;membered NNNN macrocycle Me4TACD (Me4TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). Kinetic investigations indicate that higher catalytic efficiency for the Me5PACP stabilized calcium hydride is due to easier dissociation of the dimer in solution when compared to the Me4TACD analogue.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macrocyclic ligands&lt;/b&gt; recognize ion size, but are rarely used to influence metal&#8208;centered catalytic activity. Calcium hydride cation [CaH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; supported by the fifteen&#8208;membered NNNNN macrocycle Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PACP (Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PACP=1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentaazacyclopentadecane) catalyzes hydrogenation and hydrosilylation of unactivated olefins significantly faster than the analogous calcium catalyst containing the twelve&#8208;membered NNNN macrocycle (see figure).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifteen&#8208;membered NNNNN macrocycle Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PACP (Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PACP=1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10,13&#8208;pentaazacyclopentadecane) stabilized the [CaH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fragment as a dimer with a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry at calcium. The hydride complex was prepared by protonolysis of calcium dibenzyl with the conjugate acid of Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PACP followed by hydrogenolysis or treating with &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;OctSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of the intermediate calcium benzyl cation. The calcium hydride catalyzed the hydrogenation and hydrosilylation of unactivated olefins faster than the analogous calcium complex stabilized by the twelve&#8208;membered NNNN macrocycle Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD (Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). Kinetic investigations indicate that higher catalytic efficiency for the Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PACP stabilized calcium hydride is due to easier dissociation of the dimer in solution when compared to the Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD analogue.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of Hyaluronic Acid&#8208;Covered Hierarchically Porous MIL&#8208;nanoMOF for Loading and Controlled Release of Doxorubicin</title>

Controlled release: HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was fabricated from MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoMOF, phosphite&#8208;modified adamantane (ADA&#8208;PA), and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HACD), by supramolecular and coordination interactions. The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) could be loaded into the porous structure of the nanoparticle to obtain HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P@DOX, which was stable at pH&#8197;7.2 but could release DOX in a controlled way at pH&#8197;5.7.







Abstract
The porous nano&#8208;sized metal&#8211;organic framework (nanoMOF) and its proper surface modification could greatly promote the drug loading capability and introduce biocompatibility, biodegradability, and targeting functions into nano&#8208;drug delivery systems. Herein, the HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was successfully fabricated through supramolecular and coordination interactions from three building blocks, including hierarchically porous MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoMOF, phosphite&#8208;modified adamantane (ADA&#8208;PA), and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HACD). The obtained HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was nano&#8208;sized and highly stable in physiological fluids. The porous structure of HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle could effectively load the commercial chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) with an encapsulation rate of 41.20&#8201;% and a loading rate of 48.84&#8201;%. The obtained drug&#8208;loaded HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P@DOX nanoparticle was pH&#8208;sensitive and relatively stable at neutral condition (pH&#8197;7.2) but could release DOX in a controlled way in subacid solution at pH&#8197;5.7. The simulated in&#8197;vitro DOX release experiment signified that the HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P@DOX nanoparticle could realize the controlled release of DOX in tumor issues.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30 years ago which usually need the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. Herein, we describe the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light. Our new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that Pd(I) was formed and Pd(0) was the active species. Both nitrogen&#8208; and the intermediate acyl radical can be detected. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by gas GC.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Syngas Production over Defective ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient syngas production from CO2 photoreduction is achieved by S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets. The critical role of S vacancies in tuning catalysis activity and selectivity is emphasized.







Abstract
Photocatalytic syngas (CO and H2) production with CO2 as gas source not only ameliorates greenhouse effect, but also produces valuable chemical feedstocks. However, traditional photocatalytic systems require noble metal or suffers from low yield. Here, we demonstrate that S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets are an ideal photocatalyst to drive CO2 reduction into syngas. It is found that building S vacancies can endow ZnIn2S4 with stronger photoabsorption, efficient electron&#8211;hole separation, and larger CO2 adsorption, finally promoting both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The syngas yield of CO and H2 is therefore significantly increased. In contrast to pristine ZnIn2S4, the syngas yield over VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can be improved by roughly &#8776;4.73&#8197;times and the CO/H2 ratio is modified from 1:4.18 to 1:1. Total amount of syngas after 12&#8197;h photocatalysis is as high as 63.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 without use of any noble metals, which is even higher than those of traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts in the reported literatures. This work demonstrates the critical role of S vacancies in mediating catalytic activity and selectivity, and highlights the attractive ability of defective ZnIn2S4 for light&#8208;driven syngas production.

Total amount of syngas after 12&#8197;h photocatalysis is as high as 63.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without use of any noble metals, which is even higher than those of traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts in the reported literatures. This work demonstrates the critical role of S vacancies in mediating catalytic activity and selectivity, and highlights the attractive ability of defective ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for light&#8208;driven syngas production.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intramolecular Pyridinium Oxide Cycloadditions: Systematic Study of Substitution, Diastereoselectivity, and Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular cycloaddition of pyridinium oxides was systematically studied. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction results from equatorial positioning of tether substituents. Regiochemistry results from minimization of syn&#8208;pentane interactions and eclipsing interactions. The cycloaddition reaction is stereospecific and reversible.







Abstract
Intramolecular pyridinium oxide cycloadditions form complex polycyclic nitrogenous architectures. The diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity of pyridinium oxide cycloadditions was systematically investigated for the first time using complex substrates. Predictably high levels of diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity are observed, which can be attributed to minimization of steric (syn&#8208;pentane) and torsional strain in the products. The reaction is reversible under the reaction conditions, and it is stereospecific with respect to the dipolarophile geometry.

&#8220;The long helical anthracenes reported in this article are structurally and spectroscopically novel and different from the short derivatives because of the presence of significant interlayer &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;coordinated framework film&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors with AC line filtering performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymer frameworks (CPFs) have broad applications due to their excellent features, including stable structure, intrinsic porosity, etc. However, preparation of thin film CPFs for energy storage and conversion remains challenge because of poor compatibility between conductive substrates and CPFs and crucial condition for thin film preparation. In this work, a CPF film is prepared by the coordination of the anisotropic four&#8208;armed ligand and Cu(II) at liquid&#8208;liquid interface. Such film based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) is fabricated through high energy scribing and electrolytes soaking. As&#8208;fabricated MSCs display high volumetric specific capacitance of 121.45 F cm  &#8208;3  . Besides, the volumetric energy density of MSCs reaches 52.6 mWh cm  &#8208;3  , which exceeds the electrochemical performance of most reported CPF&#8208;based MSCs. Especially, the device exhibits alternating current (AC) line filtering performance (&#8208;84.2&#176; at 120 Hz) and a short resistance&#8208;capacitance constant of 0.08 ms. This work not only provides a new CPF for MSCs with AC line filtering performance but also paves the way for thin film CPFs preparation with versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of MOFs with CAU&#8209;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type framework of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,2,4,6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2, respectively are formed. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), while the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2_np. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Cyano &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alkanes by Light Mediated Single Electron Transfer between Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are traditionally prepared by the formal [2+1] addition of carbene or radical based C1 units to alkenes. In contrast, the one pot intermolecular cyclopropanation of alkanes by redox active C1 units has remained unrealised. Herein, we achieved this process simply by exposing &#946;&#8208;aryl propionitriles and C1 radical precursors (  N  &#8208;oxy esters) to base and blue light. The overall process is redox&#8208;neutral and a photocatalyst, whether metal&#8208; or organic&#8208;based, is not required. Our findings support that single electron transfer (SET) from the &#945;&#8208;cyano carbanion of the propionitrile to the  N  &#8208;oxy ester is facilitated by blue&#8208;light via their electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. The &#945;&#8208;cyano carbon radical thus formed can then lose a &#946;&#8208;proton to form a &#960;&#8208;resonance stabilised radical anion that preferentially couples at the benzylic &#946;&#8208;position with a decarboxylated C1 radical unit. This new transition metal&#8208;free chemistry tolerates both electron rich and electron deficient (hetero)aryl systems, even sulfide or alkene functionality, to afford a range of  cis  &#8208;aryl/cyano cyclopropanes bearing congested tetrasubsitituted quaternary carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable synthesis of porous SiFe@C composite with excellent lithium storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a novel porous SiFe@C composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including suitable ball milling, partial etching and carbon layer coating. The novel pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase and a uniform carbon layer (12~16 nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilize the SEI film and markedly enhance the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g&#8208;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30%. Meanwhile, it shows larger discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles at 2 and 4 A g&#8208;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a bright prospect for the commercial production of high lithium storage capacity silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling emissive properties by intramolecular hydrogen bonds: alkyl and aryl meso&#8208;substituted porphycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, fourfold  meso&#8208;  substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents this effect is small. To explain this difference, we synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208; substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208; and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl&#8208; derivatives. Analysis of structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of six porphycenes, combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations shows a clear correlation between the strength of intramolecular NH&#183;&#183;&#183;N H&#8208;bonds and the efficiency of radiationless depopulation of the lowest excited singlet state. This result leads to a model that postulates that delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. Finding of correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) forms the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produces an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA forms a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled AAA (MWAAA) NTs and NRs are formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way we demonstrate the controlled formation of MWAAA suprastructures in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allows to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipyrrinato&#8208;Iridium(III) Complexes for Application in Photodynamic Therapy and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic dipyrrinato iridium complexes were synthesized and evaluated for their phototoxic activity against tumor cells and bacteria, the Gram&#8208;positive germ S. aureus and the Gram&#8208;negative Germ P. aeruginosa. Specifically, glycosylated phenylpyridyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes showed a high phototoxic effect against cells and S. aureus. Certain cyclopentadienyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes exerted a high phototoxic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
The generation of bio&#8208;targetable photosensitizers is of utmost importance to the emerging field of photodynamic therapy and antimicrobial (photo&#8208;)therapy. A synthetic strategy is presented in which chelating dipyrrin moieties are used to enhance the known photoactivity of iridium(III) metal complexes. Formed complexes can thus be functionalized in a facile manner with a range of targeting groups at their chemically active reaction sites. Dipyrrins with N&#8208; and O&#8208;substituents afforded (dipy)iridium(III) complexes via complexation with the respective Cp*&#8208;iridium(III) and ppy&#8208;iridium(III) precursors (dipy=dipyrrinato, Cp*=pentamethyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridyl). Similarly, electron&#8208;deficient [IrIII(dipy)(ppy)2] complexes could be used for post&#8208;functionalization, forming alkenyl, alkynyl and glyco&#8208;appended iridium(III) complexes. The phototoxic activity of these complexes has been assessed in cellular and bacterial assays with and without light; the [IrIII(Cl)(Cp*)(dipy)] complexes and the glyco&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes showing particular promise as photomedicine candidates. Representative crystal structures of the complexes are also presented.

         <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with a Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: A&#8201;Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Hybrid photochromic materials: A simple and general method for fabricating photochromic complexes by decorating metal nitrates with a coplanar 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline moiety under the collaboration of electron&#8208;transfer and coordination&#8208;assembly strategies is reported.







Abstract
As a significant class of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have attracted widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities for generating other photoresponsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photoresponsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands plays a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most CHPMs have been built from photodeformable or photoresponsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and expensive, and this greatly restricts their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new families of CHPMs besides the existing CHPMs. Herein, a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs by decorating metal nitrate with a coplanar bipyridine moiety, namely 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), is reported. The resulting products exhibit photocoloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO3&#8722; species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of the coordination environment and central metal ion on the photochromism was also studied.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hybrid photochromic materials&lt;/b&gt;: A simple and general method for fabricating photochromic complexes by decorating metal nitrates with a coplanar 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline moiety under the collaboration of electron&#8208;transfer and coordination&#8208;assembly strategies is reported.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a significant class of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have attracted widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities for generating other photoresponsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photoresponsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands plays a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most CHPMs have been built from photodeformable or photoresponsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and expensive, and this greatly restricts their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new families of CHPMs besides the existing CHPMs. Herein, a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs by decorating metal nitrate with a coplanar bipyridine moiety, namely 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), is reported. The resulting products exhibit photocoloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of the coordination environment and central metal ion on the photochromism was also studied. This work demonstrates that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrates as &#960;&#8208;EDs with the collaboration of ET and coordination&#8208;assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multidentate, V&#8208;Shaped Pyridine Building Blocks as Tectons for Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Build better! Four new, multidentate pyridine&#8208;based building blocks have been synthesised to be used as tectons in crystal engineering. They comprise a V&#8208;shaped scaffold functionalised with different moieties, namely bromine atoms, carboxylic groups, triple bonds and amine groups. This endows the tectons with distinct steric, electrostatic, and self&#8208;assembly properties, directing their solid&#8208;state structures via the formation of supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular structural units through self&#8208;assembly is a powerful method to design new architectures and materials endowed with specific properties. With the aim of adding a group of versatile tectons to the toolkit of crystal engineers, we have devised and synthesised four new V&#8208;shaped building blocks characterised by an aryl acetylene scaffold comprising three substituted pyridine rings connected by two triple bonds. The judicious choice of different substituents on the pyridine rings provides these tectons with distinctive steric, electrostatic and self&#8208;assembly properties, which influence their crystal structures and their ability to form co&#8208;crystals. Co&#8208;crystals of the tectons with tetraiododifluorobenzene were obtained both via traditional and mechanochemical crystallisation strategies, proving their potential use in crystal engineering. The energetic contributions of the supramolecular interactions at play in the crystal lattice have also been evaluated to better understand their nature and strength and to rationalise their role in designing molecular crystals.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis and structural modification of 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[b]arsoles were performed by utilizing zirconacycles, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. In addition, main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain type polymers were synthesized, and the resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[b]arsoles were synthesized from zirconacycles and diiodophenylarsine. The structural modification to the luminophore was attained through diarylacetylene precursors, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. The emission properties were controlled according to these modifications. The 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[b]arsoles showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement; the stronger emission was observed in the solid states than in solutions. In addition, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycondensation and olefin metathesis polymerization produced main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain polymers, respectively. The resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis&#8217; 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (2005&#8211;2020), one of the most widely used N,N &#8209;bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups&#8212;and be able to remove them from their final products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208; t Bu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th(IV) compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8208; fragments. Therefore, although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are observed.

         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;state lithium electrolyte was fabricated by impregnating N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium iodide (P1,1I) into the pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The liquid&#8208;like phase of confined P1,1I in combination with the ordered nanochannels of COFs result in remarkable lithium ion conductivity and good cycling performance.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co&#8208;C)&#8208;Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo&#8208;structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR&#8208;spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of the Cob&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8208;Csp3)&#8208;BDE of Cob&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT&#8208;studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDE revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally&#8208;Hindered N&#8208; and S&#8208;Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by  ortho&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how  para&#8208; vs.  meta&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in  ET  of 0.24 eV in the different media &#8211; sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device &#8211; with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower  ET  values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high  ET  materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in selective oxidations with H2O2</title>

         <title>Electrochemically Enabled One&#8208;Pot Multistep Synthesis of C19 Androgen Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of many valuable C19 androgens can be accomplished by removal of the C17 side chain from more abundant corticosteroids, followed by further derivatization of the resulting 17&#8208;keto derivative. Conventional chemical reagents pose significant drawbacks for this synthetic strategy, as large amounts of waste are generated, and quenching of the reaction mixture and purification of the 17&#8208;ketosteroid intermediate are typically required. Herein, we present mild, safe and sustainable electrochemical strategies for the preparation of C19 steroids. A reagent and catalyst free protocol for the removal of the C17 side&#8208;chain of corticosteroids via anodic oxidation has been developed, enabling several one&#8208;pot, multistep procedures for the synthesis of androgen steroids.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo . In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;coordinated and Hydrogen Bonded Phenolate Anions as One&#8208;Electron Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effect of hydrogen bonding on redox properties: The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with a tetraphosphazene base delivers non&#8208;coordinated phenolates with zinc&#8208;like redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which are capable in radical anion synthesis and SF6 activation. The addition of phenol or water allows for the selective formation of phenolate adducts and enables the study of the effect of hydrogen bonding on phenolate redox properties.







Abstract
In this work, the syntheses of non&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich phenolate anions via deprotonation of the corresponding alcohols with an extremely powerful perethyl tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) are reported. The application of uncharged phosphazenes renders the selective preparation of anionic phenol&#8208;phenolate and phenolate hydrates possible, which allows for the investigation of hydrogen bonding in these species. Hydrogen bonding brings about decreased redox potentials relative to the corresponding non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions. The latter show redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which is comparable to that of zinc metal, thus qualifying their application as organic zinc mimics. We utilized phenolates as reducing agents for the generation of radical anions in addition to the corresponding phenoxyl radicals. A tetracyanoethylene radical anion salt was synthesized and fully characterized as a representative example. We also present the activation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with phenolates in a SET reaction, in which the nature of the respective phenolate determines whether simple fluorides or pentafluorosulfanide ([SF5]&#8722;) salts are formed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effect of hydrogen bonding on redox properties&lt;/b&gt;: The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with a tetraphosphazene base delivers non&#8208;coordinated phenolates with zinc&#8208;like redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which are capable in radical anion synthesis and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; activation. The addition of phenol or water allows for the selective formation of phenolate adducts and enables the study of the effect of hydrogen bonding on phenolate redox properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the syntheses of non&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich phenolate anions via deprotonation of the corresponding alcohols with an extremely powerful perethyl tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) are reported. The application of uncharged phosphazenes renders the selective preparation of anionic phenol&#8208;phenolate and phenolate hydrates possible, which allows for the investigation of hydrogen bonding in these species. Hydrogen bonding brings about decreased redox potentials relative to the corresponding non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions. The latter show redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which is comparable to that of zinc metal, thus qualifying their application as organic zinc mimics. We utilized phenolates as reducing agents for the generation of radical anions in addition to the corresponding phenoxyl radicals. A tetracyanoethylene radical anion salt was synthesized and fully characterized as a representative example. We also present the activation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) with phenolates in a SET reaction, in which the nature of the respective phenolate determines whether simple fluorides or pentafluorosulfanide ([SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) salts are formed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Addition of Diorganozinc Reagents to Pyrazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;Diones and Indoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diones</title>

Asymmetric diorganozinc additions to cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones including pyrazolin&#8208;4,5&#8208;diones and indolin&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones are described. A wide range of highly functionalized chiral tertiary alcohols has been obtained in high to excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The success of this strategy relies on the multiple coordination of zinc aminoalkoxide species to cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones which contain two carbonyl groups.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective diorganozinc additions to cyclic diketones including pyrazolin&#8208;4,5&#8208;diones and isatins have been developed. In the presence of morpholine&#8208;containing chiral amino alcohol ligand, the corresponding chiral cyclic tertiary alcohols were produced in good to excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). The notable feature of this protocol includes its mild reaction conditions, Lewis acid additives free and broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Guided Antitumoural Drugs: (Imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)(L)gold(I) Complexes Seeking Cellular Targets Controlled by the Nature of Ligand L</title>

Striking gold: Through the choice of their secondary ligand L, a series of [4,5&#8208;diarylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes targeted different cancer cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria or lysosomes) where they interfered beneficially with molecular targets, such as DNA, thioredoxin reductase, or lysosomal membranes, to elicit p53&#8208;independent apoptosis. Such guided metallodrugs will help to minimise unwanted side effects by addressing limited arrays of targets.

Despite their identical NHC ligands, the last three accumulated in different compartments of melanoma cells, namely, the nucleus (4&#8201;b), mitochondria (5&#8201;b), or lysosomes (6&#8201;b). Ligand L was also more decisive for the site of accumulation than the NHC ligand because the couples 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 5&#8201;a/5&#8201;b, and 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, carrying different NHC ligands, afforded similar results in cytotoxicity tests, and tests on targets typically found at their sites of accumulation, such as DNA in nuclei, reactive oxygen species and thioredoxin reductase in mitochondria, and lysosomal membranes. Regardless of the site of accumulation, cancer cell apoptosis was eventually induced. The concept of guiding a bioactive complex fragment to a particular subcellular target by secondary ligand L could reduce unwanted side effects.

         <title>A Robust Mesoporous Al2O3&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Catalyst for Abundant NOx Storage with Rational Design of Pt and Ba Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Storing NOx: A rational example for the preparation of a nanocomposite catalyst showing improved NOx storage properties and originating from Ba species is demonstrated through the use of a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. Impregnation of Ba species can be completed successfully with retention of the mesoporous structure only after full crystallization of the Al2O3 framework to its &#947;&#8208;phase with the formation of Pt nanoparticles inside the Al2O3 particles.







Abstract
The nanostructural design of heterogeneous catalysts has often been demanded for assessing synergetic effects, which should be developed further by using high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous metal oxide supports. However, such opportunities have been undermined by the poor stability of ordered mesoporous structures. Herein, rational design is demonstrated to obtain nanocomposite catalysts showing improved NOx storage properties owing to the presence of Ba species over a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. It is found that Ba species are impregnated successfully only after the stabilization of the mesoporous structure by full crystallization of Al2O3 frameworks to the &#947;&#8208;phase, with the formation of Pt nanoparticles coinciding with complete removal of organic components. All the insights during this synthetic procedure are essential for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts to purify and recover NOx molecules, and are applied for designing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous nanocomposite catalysts.

         <title>Quantification of Noncovalent Interactions in Azide&#8211;Pnictogen, &#8211;Chalcogen, and &#8211;Halogen Contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions that bind: The noncovalent interactions between azides and oxygen&#8208;containing moieties are investigated through a computational study based on experimental findings. A set of 44 high&#8208;quality, gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8211;pnictogen, &#8211;chalcogen, and &#8211;halogen contacts are compiled and investigated through semiempirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations, and wave function theory.







Abstract
The noncovalent interactions between azides and oxygen&#8208;containing moieties are investigated through a computational study based on experimental findings. The targeted synthesis of organic compounds with close intramolecular azide&#8211;oxygen contacts yielded six new representatives, for which X&#8208;ray structures were determined. Two of those compounds were investigated with respect to their potential conformations in the gas phase and a possible significantly shorter azide&#8211;oxygen contact. Furthermore, a set of 44 high&#8208;quality, gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8211;pnictogen (N, P, As, Sb), &#8211;chalcogen (O, S, Se, Te), and &#8211;halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) contacts are compiled and investigated through semiempirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations, and wave function theory. A local energy decomposition (LED) analysis is applied to study the nature of the noncovalent interaction. The special role of electrostatic and London dispersion interactions is discussed in detail. London dispersion is identified as a dominant factor of the azide&#8211;donor interaction with mean London dispersion energy&#8208;interaction energy ratios of 1.3. Electrostatic contributions enhance the azide&#8211;donor coordination motif. The association energies range from &#8722;1.00 to &#8722;5.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Combined Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and C&#8722;H Functionalization for Facile Synthesis of Non&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;Atropisomer&#8208;Type Axially Chiral Organosilanes</title>

Powerful DKR: A palladium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ortho C&#8722;H olefination/alkynylaton combined with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is developed to construct axially chiral styrene&#8208;type organosilanes with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Although asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization has been available for the synthesis of structurally diverse molecules, catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to change racemic stereogenic axes remain synthetic challenges in this field. Here, a concise palladium&#8208;catalyzed DKR was combined with C&#8722;H functionalization involving olefination and alkynylation for the highly efficient synthesis of non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;atropisomer&#8208;type (NBA) axially chiral oragnosilanes. The chemistry proceeded through two different and distinct DKR: first, an atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o&#8242;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Deciphering the Chemical Basis of Fluorescence of a Selenium&#8208;Labeled Uracil Probe when Bound at the Bacterial Ribosomal A&#8208;Site</title>

Cause and effect: The fluorescence of SeU in the context of ribosomal RNA and in the presence of antibiotic paromomycin has been investigated by means of computational methods. Our results explain why the probe does not emit if antibiotics are not present and which factors are the most important to control fluorescence.







Abstract
We unveil in this work the main factors that govern the turn&#8208;on/off fluorescence of a Se&#8208;modified uracil probe at the ribosomal RNA A&#8208;site. Whereas the constraint into an &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; conformation of the two rings of the fluorophore is the main driver for the observed turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission in the presence of the antibiotic paromomycin, the electrostatics of the environment plays a minor role during the emission process. Our computational strategy clearly indicates that, in the absence of paromomycin, the probe prefers conformations that show a dark S1 electronic state with participation of n&#960;* electronic transition contributions between the selenium atom and the &#960;&#8208;system of the uracil moiety.

         <title>C&#8722;N Axial Chiral Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: Catalytic Stereoselective &#945;&#8208;Oxytosylation of Ketones</title>

Novel C&#8208;N axial chiral iodoarenes enable catalytic stereoselective &#945;&#8208;oxytosylations of ketones with high yields and improved enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A simple synthesis of a library of novel C&#8722;N axially chiral iodoarenes is achieved in a three&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available aniline derivatives. C&#8722;N axial chiral iodine reagents are rarely investigated in the hypervalent iodine arena. The potential of the novel chiral iodoarenes as organocatalysts for stereoselective oxidative transformations is assessed using the well explored, but challenging stereoselective &#945;&#8208;oxytosylation of ketones. All investigated reagents catalyse the stereoselective oxidation of propiophenone to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;oxytosylated products with good stereochemical control. Using the optimised reaction conditions a wide range of products was obtained in generally good to excellent yields and with good enantioselectivities.

         <title>Mo2C/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity and Biocompatibility for Microbial Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial fuel cells: A unique porous nanocomposite Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide decorated on carbon paper is demonstrated as an advanced multifunction anode for microbial fuel cells. The hierarchical porous structure and rough surface of Mo2C granules are energetically in favor of the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and thus guarantee an admirable energy conversion efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the carbon paper.







Abstract
A simple, cost&#8208;effective strategy was developed to effectively improve the electron transfer efficiency as well as the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by decorating the commercial carbon paper (CP) anode with an advanced Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide (Mo2C/RGO) composite. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the superior electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C, the high surface area, and prominent conductivity of RGO, the MFC equipped with this Mo2C/RGO composite yielded a remarkable output power density of 1747&#177;37.6&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2, which was considerably higher than that of CP&#8208;MFC (926.8&#177;6.3&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2). Importantly, the composite also facilitated the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria&#8211;electrode interaction. These features resulted in an enhanced coulombic efficiency up 13.2&#8201;%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the CP (1.2&#8201;%).

         <title>Small Figure&#8208;Eight Luminophores: Double&#8208;Twisted Tethered Cyclic Binaphthyls Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped cyclic naphthalenes with different tethers were synthesized, and their CPL properties were investigated. Compounds with short tether showed remarkable boosting of the glum (0.010&#8211;0.016). The proximate figure&#8208;eight luminophore promotes elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum.







Abstract
Double&#8208;twisted cyclic binaphthyls, in which two naphthalenes are tethered by &#8208;O(CH2)nO&#8208; linkage (n=1&#8211;3), have been synthesized. X&#8208;ray analyses and DFT calculations revealed a tightly constrained stereogenic figure&#8208;eight geometry. Tethering of two naphthalenes by short linkage forces a small dihedral angle, and the cyclic binaphthyls with short tether (n=1, 2) exhibit remarkable boosting of the glum value (1.0&#8211;1.6&#215;10&#8722;2) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and unusual glum/gabs ratios (0.93&#8211;1.3). These experimental high |glum| values are in accord with the results of excited state TD&#8208;DFT calculations, which show transannular interactions and that consequent extensive delocalization occurs throughout the figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;core. As a result, the present figure&#8208;eight luminophore promote the elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum values.

&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Carbon Origami via an Alumina&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational folding of nanographenes has the potential to penetrate the barrier between macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;worlds for the engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials with functional molecular shapes. This work reports that an alumina&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation strategy is able to tackle this challenge allowing both the effective incorporation of non&#8208;hexagonal rings and the formation of helical structures leading to the folding of nanographenes akin to origami. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Amsharov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003448).

         <title>Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic amines are directly formed from secondary amines and alkynes in the presence of highly active titanium catalysts. The corresponding hydroaminoalkylation reactions, which take place by C&#8722;H bond activation at sp3&#8208;centers in the &#945;&#8208;position to a nitrogen atom, can be achieved with internal and terminal alkynes, and best results are obtained with N&#8208;benzylaniline derivatives.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of alkynes with secondary amines, which selectively give access to allylic amines with E configuration of the alkene unit, are achieved in the presence of titanium catalysts. Successful reactions of symmetrically substituted diaryl&#8208; and dialkylalkynes as well as a terminal alkyne take place with N&#8208;benzylanilines, N&#8208;alkylanilines, and N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines.

         <title>Zinc Oxide Defect Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Derived from Oxidation of Metallic Zinc: Thin&#8208;Film Transistor and Sensor Behavior of ZnO Films and Rods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of combined defect cluster sites in zinc oxide: Oxidation of plasma sputtered zinc generates zinc oxide films in which Doppler broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and positron annihilation life&#8208;time studies (PALS) make it possible to detect oxygen vacancies (Vo) that are in close proximity to zinc vacancies (VZn). They form defect cluster sites acting as shallow acceptors reducing the overall electron conductivity. PAS and PALS is able to correlate semiconducting behavior and microstructure in ZnO thin film transistors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004270).

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the dialuminum complex [{(MeIMes)PH}(AlMe3)2] was obtained for MeIMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. These complexes served as initiators for the efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide in toluene at 60 &#176;C. High degrees of isoselectivity were found for the poly(rac&#8208;lactide) obtained in the presence of the monoaluminum complexes (Pm up to 0.92, Tm up to 191 &#176;C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination&#8208;insertion mechanism with the carbene&#8208;phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The formidable reactivity of the oxygen&#8208;evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water&#8208;soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,5DHMn  12  &#8221;) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,4,5THMn  12  &#8221;) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein we explore the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalytic process by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new  Mn  12  clusters,  3,4DHMn  12  and  2,3DHMn  12  , having one &#8211;OH group in the  meta  position relative to the benzoate&#8208;Mn moiety, and one at the  para  or  ortho  position, respectively. We discovered that the Mn centers in  3,4DHMn  12  have lower oxidation potential compared with those in  2,3DHMn  12  , and thus,  3,4DHMn  12  can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than  2,3DHMn  12  . Hence, we could establish the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalysis, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208; alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa&#8208;dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs&#8217; [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt heterojunction with boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8208;hole separation and immigration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by HRTEM. The photocatalytic H  2  evolution productivity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#956;molg  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , which is 16 times higher than that of SrTiO  3  /Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  /Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO  4  , which promotes the transfer and immigration of photogenerated carriers by forming heterojunction and the porous structure, which provides a large amounts of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H  2  release.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Carbazole Derivatives as Host Materials for Highly Efficient and Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extended host: Expansion of the &#960; conjugation of a carbazole derivative by benzothiophene units enhances its performance as a host in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. The &#960;&#8208;extended host material exhibits lower efficiency roll&#8208;off and longer operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance (LT50) of approximately 23&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 compared with conventional host materials.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that use phosphorescent and/or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are capable of realizing 100&#8201;% electron&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion. The host materials in these OLEDs play crucial roles in determining OLED performance. Carbazole derivatives are frequently used as host materials, among which 3,3&#8208;bis(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)biphenyl (mCBP) is often used for lifetime testing in scientific studies. In this study, the &#960; conjugation of the carbazole unit was expanded to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely m1BTCBP and m4BTCBP. Among these host materials, m1BTCBP formed a highly efficient [Ir(ppy)3]&#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT50) of over 300&#8197;h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (current density: 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The LT50 value at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was estimated to be about 23&#8201;000&#8197;h. This performance is clearly higher than that of mCBP&#8208;based OLEDs (LT50&#8776;8500&#8197;h).

         <title>3D&#8208;Non&#8208;destructive Imaging through Heavy&#8208;Metal Eosin Salt Contrast Agents</title>

Add some color: The dibromo fluorescein barium salt proves to be a suitable staining agent enabling the diagnostic screening of tissue samples by X&#8208;ray microscopic computed tomography without impending further diagnostics through histological methods.







Abstract
Conventional histology is a destructive technique based on the evaluation of 2D slices of a 3D biopsy. By using 3D X&#8208;ray histology these obstacles can be overcome, but their application is still restricted due to the inherently low attenuation properties of soft tissue. In order to solve this problem, the tissue can be stained before X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging (CT) to enhance the soft tissue X&#8208;ray contrast. Evaluation of brominated fluorescein salts revealed a mutual influence of the number of bromine atoms and the cations applied on the achieved contrast enhancement. The dibromo fluorescein barium salt turned out to be the ideal X&#8208;ray contrast agent, allowing for 3D imaging and subsequent complementing counterstaining applying standard histological techniques.

         <title>Aromatic Metamorphosis of Thiophenes by Means of Desulfurative Dilithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desulfurative dilithiation of thiophenes and benzo&#8208;fused derivatives using lithium metal has been developed for the efficient generation of multi&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dilithium compounds. The resulting dianions are key intermediates for the synthesis of diverse heteroles. This protocol also enables the desulfurative construction of aromatic rings from thiophene derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
A new mode of aromatic metamorphosis has been developed, which allows thiophenes and their benzo&#8208;fused derivatives to be converted to a variety of exotic heteroles. This transformation involves 1)&#8197;the efficient generation of key 1,4&#8208;dianions by means of desulfurative dilithiation with lithium powder and 2)&#8197;the subsequent trapping of the dianions with heteroatom electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot manner. Via the desulfurative dilithiation, the sulfur atoms of thiophenes are replaced also with a carbon&#8211;carbon double bond or a 1,2&#8208;phenylene for the construction of benzene rings.

     alt="Aromatic Metamorphosis of Thiophenes by Means of Desulfurative Dilithiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desulfurative dilithiation&lt;/b&gt; of thiophenes and benzo&#8208;fused derivatives using lithium metal has been developed for the efficient generation of multi&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dilithium compounds. The resulting dianions are key intermediates for the synthesis of diverse heteroles. This protocol also enables the desulfurative construction of aromatic rings from thiophene derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new mode of aromatic metamorphosis has been developed, which allows thiophenes and their benzo&#8208;fused derivatives to be converted to a variety of exotic heteroles. This transformation involves 1)&#8197;the efficient generation of key 1,4&#8208;dianions by means of desulfurative dilithiation with lithium powder and 2)&#8197;the subsequent trapping of the dianions with heteroatom electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot manner. Via the desulfurative dilithiation, the sulfur atoms of thiophenes are replaced also with a carbon&#8211;carbon double bond or a 1,2&#8208;phenylene for the construction of benzene rings.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Thermally Responsive Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes Bearing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Pillar[5]arene Rings**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping in shape: Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based polyrotaxanes were produced from pillar[5]arene as ring components by precipitation in water/methanol and a subsequent capping reaction. Multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important for the preparation and also provided a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyrotaxane with heat&#8208;induced elasticity and shape memory properties without additional crosslinking.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) are useful polymers with good water solubility, biological compatibility, and commercial availability. PEOs with various end groups were threaded into pillar[5]arene rings in a mixture of water and methanol to afford pseudopolyrotaxanes. Corresponding polyrotaxanes were also constructed by capping COOH&#8208;terminated pseudopolyrotaxanes with bulky amines, in which multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important to prevent dethreading. The number of threaded ring components could be rationally controlled in these materials, providing a simple and versatile method to tune the mechanical and thermal properties. Specifically, a polyrotaxane with a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle became elastic upon heating above the melting point of PEOs and exhibited temperature&#8208;dependent shape memory property because of the topological confinement and crosslinked hydrogen bonds.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi&#8208;Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near&#8208;IR probe to unveil a rapid excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer&#8594;charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Sorption Using Compartmentalized Coordination Polymers with Discrete Voids**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a trap! The use of a metal&#8208;organic material with discrete voids serves to efficiently trap CO2 from different gas mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments show an excellent selectivity and regenerability in mixtures with CH4 and N2.







Abstract
Carbon capture and storage with porous materials is one of the most promising technologies to minimize CO2 release into the atmosphere. Here, we report a family of compartmentalized coordination polymers (CCPs) capable of capturing gas molecules in a selective manner based on two novel tetrazole&#8208;based ligands. Crystal structures have been modelled theoretically under the Density Functional Theory (DFT) revealing the presence of discrete voids of 380&#8197;&#197;3. Single gas adsorption isotherms of N2, CH4 and CO2 have been measured, obtaining a loading capacity of 0.6, 1.7 and 2.2 molecules/void at 10&#8197;bar and at 298&#8197;K for the best performing material. Moreover, they present excellent selectivity and regenerability for CO2 in mixtures with CH4 and N2 in comparison with other reported materials, as evidenced by dynamic breakthrough gas experiments. These frameworks are therefore great candidates for separation of gas mixtures in the chemical engineering industry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Closing Olefin Metathesis Catalyzed by Well&#8208;Defined Vanadium Alkylidene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined vanadium alkylidene complexes catalyze ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis of various dienes with activity acceptable for routine organic synthesis. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group, as well as the size and &#963;&#8208;donating properties of the phosphine.







Abstract
Vanadium&#8208;based catalysts have shown activity and selectivity in ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of strained cyclic olefins comparable to those of Ru, Mo, and W catalysts. However, the application of V alkylidenes in routine organic synthesis is limited. Here, we present the first example of ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis catalyzed by well&#8208;defined V chloride alkylidene phosphine complexes. The developed catalysts exhibit tolerance to various functional groups, such as an ether, an ester, a tertiary amide, a tertiary amine, and a sulfonamide. The size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group and the phosphine play a crucial role in the stability of active intermediates. Reactions with ethylene and olefins suggest that both &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of the metallacyclobutene and bimolecular decomposition are responsible for catalyst degradation.

         <title>An Antimony(III) Fluoride Oxalate with Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of different functional groups has led to the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate material, KSb2C2O4F5, to exhibit a birefringent response (&#916;n=0.170 at 546&#8197;nm); this value is larger than that of the commercial &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4, despite its suboptimal anisotropic structure.







Abstract
Birefringent materials play a key role in modulating the polarization of light and thus in optical communication as well as in laser techniques and science. Designing new, excellent birefringent materials remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate birefringent material, KSb2C2O4F5, by a combination of delocalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8722; groups, stereochemical active Sb3+ cations, and the most electronegative element, fluorine. The [C2O4]2&#8722; groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb2C2O4F5; nonetheless, KSb2C2O4F5 exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;n=0.170 at 546&#8197;nm) that is even better than that of the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4, even though the latter features an optimal arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B3O6]3&#8722; groups. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8722; anions, highly distorted SbO2F2 and SbOF3 polyhedra with a stereochemically active lone pair. The combination of lone&#8208;pair electrons and &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems boosts the birefringence to a large extent and will help the development of high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.

The [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;; nonetheless, KSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=0.170 at 546&#8197;nm) that is even better than that of the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material &#945;&#8208;BaB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, even though the latter features an optimal arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, highly distorted SbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SbOF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polyhedra with a stereochemically active lone pair. The combination of lone&#8208;pair electrons and &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems boosts the birefringence to a large extent and will help the development of high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Proton&#8208;switchable&#8221; biomimetic metal complex: An oxo&#8208;transfer reaction at the metal center is controlled by protonation of the remote ligand sphere, which modulates electron donor ability of the ligand, promotes oxidant binding, and facilitates access to high&#8208;valent catalytic intermediates.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbones might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. A conceptually parallel process might allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unusually Large Hexameric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large, hexameric cage based on amide dimerization self&#8208;assembles from a designed macrocyclic building block in nonpolar solvents. The unusually large structure (V&#8764;2800&#8197;&#197;3) features openings commonly associated with covalently linked cages and forms host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70). The formation of the hexameric structure was found to be strongly concentration dependent.







Abstract
The sizes of available self&#8208;assembled hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;based supramolecular capsules and cages are rather limited. The largest systems have volumes of approximately 1400&#8211;2300&#8197;&#197;3. Herein, we report a large, hexameric cage based on intermolecular amide&#8211;amide dimerization. The unusual structure with openings, reminiscent of covalently linked cages, is held together by 24 hydrogen bonds. With a diameter of 2.3&#8197;nm and a cavity volume of &#8764;2800&#8197;&#197;3, the assembly is larger than any previously known capsule/cage structure relying exclusively on hydrogen bonds. The self&#8208;assembly process in chlorinated, organic solvents was found to be strongly concentration dependent, with the monomeric form prevailing at low concentrations. Additionally, the formation of host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70) was observed.

         <title>Personalized Reusable Face Masks with Smart Nano&#8208;Assisted Destruction of Pathogens for COVID&#8208;19: A Visionary Road</title>

Multifunctional masks for COVID: Multifunctional materials with unique chemical and physical properties can be fabricated by combining electrospun nanofibers, plasmonic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoclusters, and 3D printed structures. This concept article highlights smart nanomaterials&#8217; key role in developing the next generation of face masks with the highest impact in terms of self&#8208;sanitizing, filtration efficiency, and effective comfort.







Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreak. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and antipathogen properties. Here, how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials is outlined. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility of developing a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically driven and on&#8208;demand antipathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photothermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.

         <dc:description>The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu(I) halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2a: X = Cl, 2b: X = Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4).

Here, we report the design of core&#8208;shell hybrid materials based on a TiO  2  core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;  graft  &#8208;(n&#8208;propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  ). The PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO  2  core. This resulted in high visible light&#8208;driven H  2  generation. The enhanced light&#8208;driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core&#8208;shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  was possible by introducing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  cluster anions as hydrogen evolution&#8208;cocatalyst. This novel design approach is one example for a multi&#8208;component system where reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphs of the gadolinite&#8208;type borates ZrB2O5&#160;and HfB2O5&#160;under extreme pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the results from previous high&#8208;pressure experiments on the gadolinite&#8208;type mineral datolite,&#160;CaBSiO4(OH), the behavior of the isostructural borates &#946;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;and &#946;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;have been studied by synchrotron&#8208;based in situ high&#8208;pressure single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. On compression to 120 GPa, both borate layer&#8208;structures are preserved. Additionally, at ~114&#160;GPa, the formation of a second phase can be observed in both compounds. The new high&#8208;pressure modification&#160;&#947;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;features a rearrangement of the corner&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra, while still maintaining the four&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings. The new phase&#160;&#947;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;contains ten&#8208;membered rings including the rare structural motif of edge&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra with exceptionally short B&#8211;O and B&#183;&#183;&#183;B distances. For both structures, unusually high coordination numbers are found for the transition metal cations, with ninefold coordinated Hf4+, and tenfold coordinated Zr4+, respectively. These findings remarkably show the potential of cold compression as a low&#8208;energy pathway to discover metastable structures that exhibit new coordinations and structural motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Supramolecular Structural Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl and Tetrafluorosulfanylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of crystal structures of SF  5  &#8208; or SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules revealed that these groups are often surrounded by hydrogen or other fluorine atoms. Even though fluorine prefers F&#183;&#183;&#183;H over F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts, the latter appeared to be important in many compounds. In a significant number of datasets, the closest F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts are below 95% of the van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals distance of two F atoms. Moreover, a number of repeating structural motifs formed by contacts between SF  5  groups was identified, including different supramolecular dimers and infinite chains. Among SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules, the study focused on SF  4  Cl compounds, including the first solid&#8208;state structure analyses of these reactive species. Additionally, electrostatic potential surfaces of a series of Ph&#8208;SF  5  derivatives were calculated, pointing out the substituent influence on the ability of F&#183;&#183;&#183;X contact formation (X = F or other electronegative atom). Interaction energies were calculated for different dimeric arrangements of Ph&#8208;SF  5  , which were extracted from experimental crystal structure determinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Spin&#8208;Crossover Cooperativity in Hybrid 1&#8208;D Chains of FeII&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;trizole Trimers Linked by [Au(CN)2]&#8208; Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foremost, practical applications of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) materials require control of the nature of the spin&#8208;state coupling. In existing SCO materials, there is a single, well&#8208;defined dimensionality relevant to the switching behavior. We show that a new material, consisting of 1,2,4&#8208;trizole&#8208;based trimers coordinated into 1&#8208;D chains by [Au(CN)2]&#8208; and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests, undergoes SCO defined by elastic coupling across multiple dimensional hierarchies. Detailed structural, vibrational, and theoretical studies conclusively confirm that intra&#8208;trimer coupling is an order of magnitude great than the intra&#8208;molecular coupling, which is an order of magnitude greater than inter&#8208;molecular coupling. As such, we have ascertained for the first time a clear hierarchy on the nature of elastic coupling in SCO materials, a necessary step for the technological development of molecular switching materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence for Achiral Metal Organic Colloids and the Guest Molecules in Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, scientists have reported a bunch of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that could emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence that observed in the vortex stirring. The absolute values for  g  lum  are 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. Plus or minus of  g  lum  depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easily be manipulated. Further, host&#8208;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interaction and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from colloidal solution to guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yield and pretty well  g  lum  value in the colloidal solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Review The overview of N&#8208;rich antennae investigated in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discuss their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence.

         <title>In&#8197;Situ Corrosion Fabrication of NaNbO3/Nb3O7F Heterojunctions with Optimized Band Realignment for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunctions: NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions are fabricated through an in&#8197;situ corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is investigated systematically for photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endow the NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions with high HER activity.







Abstract
Heterostructured photocatalysis is a significant issue owing to the unique band alignment, improved spectrum absorption, and enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, the construction of uniform, controllable, and effective heterojunctions is still a huge challenge. Herein, NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions are fabricated through an in&#8197;situ corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is investigated systematically in terms of photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endow the NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions with a high HER activity (43.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is about 2.4&#8197;times that of pure Nb3O7F and 1.36&#8197;times that of pure NaNbO3. The results may provide some new insights into the corrosion technique and HER activity of novel heterostructured catalysts.

         <title>Extended Peptide Nucleic Acid Nucleobases Based on Isoorotic Acid for the Recognition of A&#8211;U Base Pairs in Double&#8208;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a bind: Four new A&#8211;U binding nucleobases (Io1&#8211;Io4) are prepared and incorporated into peptide nucleic acids (PNA) for triple helical binding with double&#8208;stranded RNA. Io nucleobases show two times stronger Hoogsteen&#8208;hydrogen bonded triplets with A&#8211;U and similar selectivity compared to commonly used T*A&#8211;U triplets. Notably, strong binding is retained when four sequential Io4 residues are employed.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) with extended isoorotamide containing nucleobases (Io) were designed for binding A&#8211;U base pairs in double&#8208;stranded RNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed improved affinity for A&#8211;U using the Io scaffold in PNA. PNAs having four sequential Io extended nucleobases maintained high binding affinity.

         <title>Tetryl&#8208;Tetrylene Addition to Phenylacetylene</title>

Phenylacetylene adds [Ar*GeH2&#8208;SnAr&#8217;], [Ar*GeH2&#8208;PbAr&#8217;] and [Ar'SnH2&#8208;PbAr*] in a regioselective and stereoselective reaction. NMR chemical shifts of the olefins were investigated using two&#8208; and four&#8208;component relativistic DFT calculations, as spin&#8211;orbit effects can be large. Hydride abstraction was carried out by treating [Ar'SnPhC=CHGeH2Ar*] with the trityl salt [Ph3C][Al(OC{CF3}3)4] to yield cationic germastannacyclobutene.







Abstract
Phenylacetylene adds [Ar*GeH2&#8208;SnAr&#8217;], [Ar*GeH2&#8208;PbAr&#8217;] and [Ar'SnH2&#8208;PbAr*] at rt in a regioselective and stereoselective reaction. The highest reactivity was found for the stannylene, which reacts immediately upon addition of one equivalent of alkyne. However, the plumbylenes exhibit addition to the alkyne only in reaction with an excess of phenylacetylene. The product of the germylplumbylene addition reacts with a second equivalent of alkyne and the product of a CH&#8208;activation, a dimeric lead acetylide, were isolated. In the case of the stannylplumbylene the trans&#8208;addition product was characterized as the kinetically controlled product which isomerizes at rt to yield the cis&#8208;addition product, which is stabilized by an intramolecular Sn&#8211;H&#8211;Pb interaction. NMR chemical shifts of the olefins were investigated using two&#8208; and four&#8208;component relativistic DFT calculations, as spin&#8211;orbit effects can be large. Hydride abstraction was carried out by treating [Ar'SnPhC=CHGeH2Ar*] with the trityl salt [Ph3C][Al(OC{CF3})4] to yield a four membered ring cation.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure High&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Mixed Nitridosilicatephosphates and Luminescence of AESiP3N7:Eu2+ (AE=Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitridosilicatephosphates are synthesized using high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions. The incorporation of P and Si as well as their occupational disorder in the compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) is proven by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, STEM&#8208;EDX mapping, and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show blue luminescence under irradiation with UV light and therefore expand the range of possible host lattices for luminescent materials.







Abstract
Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well&#8208;known examples of such nitrides that upon doping with Eu2+ exhibit intriguing luminescence properties, which makes them attractive for applications. Nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates show manifold structural variability; however, no mixed nitridosilicatephosphates except SiPN3 and SiP2N4NH have been described so far. The compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8211;1700&#8201;&#176;C) starting from the respective alkaline earth azides and the binary nitrides P3N5 and Si3N4. The latter were activated by NH4F, probably acting as a mineralizing agent. SrSiP3N7 and BaSiP3N7 were obtained as single crystals. They crystallized in the barylite&#8208;1O (M=Sr) and barylite&#8208;2O structure types (M=Ba), respectively, with P and Si being occupationally disordered. Cation disorder was further supported by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of BaSiP3N7 with atomic resolution. Upon doping with Eu2+, both compounds showed blue emission under UV excitation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first nitridosilicatephosphates&lt;/b&gt; are synthesized using high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions. The incorporation of P and Si as well as their occupational disorder in the compounds &lt;i&gt;AE&lt;/i&gt;SiP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AE&lt;/i&gt;=Sr, Ba) is proven by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, STEM&#8208;EDX mapping, and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;doped samples show blue luminescence under irradiation with UV light and therefore expand the range of possible host lattices for luminescent materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well&#8208;known examples of such nitrides that upon doping with Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit intriguing luminescence properties, which makes them attractive for applications. Nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates show manifold structural variability; however, no mixed nitridosilicatephosphates except SiPN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SiP2N4NH have been described so far. The compounds &lt;i&gt;AE&lt;/i&gt;SiP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AE&lt;/i&gt;=Sr, Ba) were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8211;1700&#8201;&#176;C) starting from the respective alkaline earth azides and the binary nitrides P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The latter were activated by NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F, probably acting as a mineralizing agent. SrSiP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and BaSiP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; were obtained as single crystals. They crystallized in the barylite&#8208;1O (M=Sr) and barylite&#8208;2O structure types (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Ba), respectively, with P and Si being occupationally disordered. Cation disorder was further supported by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of BaSiP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; with atomic resolution. Upon doping with Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, both compounds showed blue emission under UV excitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;We developed a seeding methodology for obtaining zinc oxide nanorods. It employs zinc oxide nanoparticles for nanorod growth using a molecular precursor onto the surface of crystalline semiconducting zinc oxide thin films. The obtained ZnO nanorods show a high UV sensitivity and the ZnO thin films a decent field effect transistor performance. Their defect characteristics were studied by positron annihilation spectroscopy.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Replacing the Rhamnose&#8208;Xylose Moiety of QS&#8208;21 with Simpler Terminal Disaccharide Units Attenuates Adjuvant Activity in Truncated Saponin Variants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shorter route to vaccine adjuvants: These multidisciplinary studies have provided streamlined access to new terminal disaccharide variants of truncated, QS&#8208;21 inspired saponin vaccine adjuvants through an expeditious synthetic route, and have identified a critical role for the native rhamnose&#8208;xylose moiety in adjuvant activity in connection with saponin conformation.







Abstract
Adjuvants are key immunostimulatory components in vaccine formulations, which improve the immune response to the co&#8208;administered antigen. The saponin natural product QS&#8208;21 is one of the most promising immunoadjuvants in the development of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases but suffers from limitations that have hampered its widespread human use. Previous structure&#8211;activity relationship studies have identified simplified saponin variants with truncated carbohydrate chains, but have not focused on the influence of the linear oligosaccharide domain of QS&#8208;21 in adjuvant activity. Herein, an expeditious 15&#8208;step synthesis of new linear trisaccharide variants of simplified QS&#8208;21&#8208;derived adjuvants is reported, in which the complex terminal xylose&#8208;rhamnose moiety has been replaced with commercially available, simpler lactose and cellobiose disaccharides in a &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration. In vivo immunological evaluation of the synthetic saponins showed attenuated antibody responses, highlighting the negative impact of such carbohydrate modifications on adjuvant activity, which could be associated with higher saponin conformational flexibility.

         <title>Chemodivergence between Electrophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cross&#8208;coupling reactions, chemoselectivity becomes a concern when two or more (pseudo)halides are present in the substrates. This minireview surveys cases in which divergent chemoselectivity between electrophiles can be achieved under different reaction conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing the possible mechanistic origins of selectivity control.







Abstract
Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as emerging fluorinated groups: synthesis under photoredox catalysis and determination of the lipophilicity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two&#8208;step strategy based on a metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88% which raised to 98% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physico&#8208;chemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A titanium(III)&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from&#160;&#945;&#8208;sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base&#8208;mediated&#160;&#945;&#8208;alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied to the&#160;&#945;&#8208;desulfonylation of ketones too. In addition, a one&#8208;pot desulfonylative alkylation is demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a catalyst&#8208;dependent mechanism involving a homolytic C&#8208;S cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Cleavage of Cyclobutanols Through Ir&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;C Bond Activation: Mechanistic and Synthetic Aspects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium behaves differently! Unexpectedly, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed cleavage of cyclobutanols to give &#946;&#8208;chiral ketones proceeds through a different mechanism as compared to related Rh&#8208;catalyzed reactions. This was shown by deuteration experiments, kinetic isotope effect measurements and DFT calculations. The developed method for the catalytic enantioselective desymmetrization is of particular value in the synthesis of chromane&#8208;related natural products from readily accessible spirocyclobutanols.







Abstract
The Ir&#8208;catalyzed conversion of prochiral tert&#8208;cyclobutanols to &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted ketones proceeds under comparably mild conditions in toluene (45&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C) and is particularly suited for the enantioselective desymmetrization of &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted substrates to give products with a quaternary chirality center with up to 95&#8201;% ee using DTBM&#8208;SegPhos as a chiral ligand. Deuteration experiments and kinetic isotope effect measurements revealed major mechanistic differences to related RhI&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Supported by DFT calculations we propose the initial formation of an IrIII hydride intermediate, which then undergoes a &#946;&#8208;C elimination (C&#8722;C bond activation) prior to reductive C&#8722;H elimination. The computational model also allows the prediction of the stereochemical outcome. The Ir&#8208;catalyzed cyclobutanol cleavage is broadly applicable but fails for substrates bearing strongly coordinating groups. The method is of particular value for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of substituted chromanes related to the tocopherols and other natural products.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Tetraorganoborates**

Shining light on organoborates: A photocatalyzed oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of functionalized organoborates is described, providing a diverse range of biaryl and olefin products. The mechanism of this C&#8722;C bond formation was investigated through quantum chemical calculations, revealing an unusual boracyclic intermediate.







Abstract
Readily accessible tetraorganoborate salts undergo selective coupling reactions under blue light irradiation in the presence of catalytic amounts of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free acridinium photocatalysts to furnish unsymmetrical biaryls, heterobiaryls and arylated olefins. This represents an interesting conceptual approach to forge C&#8722;C bonds between aryl, heteroaryl and alkenyl groups under smooth photochemical conditions. Computational studies were conducted to investigate the mechanism of the transformation.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration/Desulfonylation Cascade: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>

Cascade reaction: The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides through a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides is reported. The combination of a cobalt catalyst together with a phosphine ligand and a metal reductive agent results in soft conditions compatible with a wide range of functional groups. The cascade reaction is used as a key step in a flexible synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;deoxyeseroline, a pyrrolidino&#8208;indoline alkaloid.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides was developed. The reaction was highly chemoselective, allowing the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides possessing a variety of functional groups. The method was used as the key step to synthesize an alkaloid, (&#177;)&#8208;deoxyeseroline. Mechanistic investigations suggest a radical process.

         <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,12&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C&#8722;C bond between the monomer units (1) and two asymmetric ones with a C&#8722;N bond between the monomer units (2 and 3). Compound 3 displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound 3 also exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.

The DHDAT units are planar in the C&#8722;C linked dimer 1 but perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8722;N linked dimers 2 and 3 (from X&#8208;ray analysis). The electronic ground&#8208;state interaction between the two units is large in 1 and small in 2 and 3. The emission behavior of 3 is different from that of other dimers and its monomer; it displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound 3 exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox chemistry with bismuth: Snapshots of the redox chemistry of heavy p&#8208;block elements are difficult to obtain and remain rare to date. This work demonstrates that redox&#8208;active ligands in the coordination sphere of bismuth facilitate well&#8208;behaved one&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactions according to cyclic voltammetry. The charge of the complexes (neutral vs. cationic) allows the spin density to shift either towards the ligand or towards the metal center. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Lichtenberg et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005186).

         <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air&#8208;Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P&#8208;Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles: A novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) retained its metallic nature in air and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of carbonyls, nitriles, and nitroarenes in water. The used nano&#8208;Ni2P could be easily handled and reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Air&#8208;stable non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;: A novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P) retained its metallic nature in air and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of carbonyls, nitriles, and nitroarenes in water. The used nano&#8208;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P could be easily handled and reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano&#8208;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Response Activated by SbIII Lone&#8208;Pair Stereoactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the stereoactive lone pair cation of SbIII into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb6O7(SO4)2 is achieved. Sb3+ cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a three&#8208;dimensional asymmetric dense structure. The material exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window and considerable environmental stabilities, which endow it a promising UV nonlinear optical material. Theoretical studies reveal that the functional SbIII with stereochemical active lone pair makes predominant contribution to the enhanced effect. More information can be found in the Communication by X.&#8208;T. An, G.&#8208;M. Wang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004859).

         <title>Tuning the Molecular Packing of Self&#8208;Assembled Amphiphilic PtII Complexes by Varying the Hydrophilic Side&#8208;Chain Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray diffraction and advanced solid&#8208;state NMR studies were combined as a new, general tool for detailed structural and supramolecular elucidation, using a series of amphiphilic PtII complexes as model compounds. Our approach provides an alternative for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible, which can be potentially applied to many other molecular and macromolecular platforms.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship between molecular design and packing modes constitutes one of the major challenges in self&#8208;assembly and is essential for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high precision control over the supramolecular packing of amphiphilic PtII complexes by systematic variation of the hydrophilic side&#8208;chain length. A novel approach of general applicability based on complementary X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has allowed us to establish a clear correlation between molecular features and supramolecular ordering. Systematically increasing the side&#8208;chain length gradually increases the steric demand and reduces the extent of aromatic interactions, thereby inducing a gradual shift in the molecular packing from parallel to a long&#8208;slipped organization. Notably, our findings highlight the necessity of advanced solid&#8208;state NMR techniques to gain structural information for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible. Our work further demonstrates a new molecular design strategy to modulate aromatic interaction strengths and packing arrangements that could be useful for the engineering of functional materials based on PtII and aromatic molecules.

         <title>Amorphous Boron Dispersed in LaCoO3 with Large Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Catalytic Propane Oxidation</title>

Boron&#8208;induced oxygen defects: Unsatisfactory oxygen mobility is a barrier to the development of perovskites for low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compound oxidation. This work introduces small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into the LaCoO3 crystal through an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects. The resulting Co3+ rich surface and large oxygen vacancies realized with the amorphous boron dispersed in LaCoO3 shows efficient propane oxidation activity.







Abstract
Unsatisfactory oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskites for low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into the LaCoO3 crystal through an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, which are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C3H8) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces a high distortion of the LaCoO3 crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces a large proportion of bulk Co2+ species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Additionally, surface Co3+ species, as the acid sites, which are active for cleaving the C&#8722;H bonds of C3H8 molecules, are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co/B=0.93:0.07) displays the best C3H8 oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO2 and H2O, lasting 200&#8197;h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites by the regulation of amorphous boron dispersion.

         <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent tetracyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyri(mi)dines can be generated by microwave&#8208;assisted high order (8+2) thermal cycloadditions between in situ formed benzynes and the corresponding bicyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyr(im)idines. These cycloadducts absorb and emit photons in the 400&#8208;500 nm region and are efficiently uptaken by cells with low cytotoxicity. Upon irradiation, these molecules generate singlet oxygen and are able to kill cancer cells at low concentration, thus emerging as promising candidates for photodynamic therapy and fluorescence imaging. .

         <title>Isomers of B&#8592;N&#8208;Fused Dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes: How B&#8592;N Affects Opto&#8208;electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>

Three dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes were synthesized in which two B&#8592;N units were introduced at different positions. They showed significantly different opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance.







Abstract
The B&#8592;N unit has a large dipole and it is isoelectronic to C&#8722;C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B&#8592;N units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto&#8208;electronic properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how the B&#8592;N unit affects electronic structures and opto&#8208;electronic properties of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we developed three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules in which two B&#8592;N units were introduced at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B&#8592;N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto&#8208;electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto&#8208;electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.

         <title>Parallel Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Strategy Based on Bimetal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Ferrotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Framework for ferroptosis: A parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy has been designed based on a drug&#8208;sandwiched metal&#8211;organic framework (EsMOF) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The catalytic MOF can initiate dual Fenton reactions to generate abundant .OH. Through MOF&#8208;catalyzed .OH generation and GSH depletion&#8208;inactive GPX4, the catalytic nanomedicine can effectively inhibit tumor growth, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.







Abstract
Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell&#8208;death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between the MOF layers with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide as spacers. In a tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs through glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide, while erastin&#8208;aggravated glutathione depletion down&#8208;regulated glutathione peroxidase 4; this then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy that effectively inhibited tumor growth in live mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Framework for ferroptosis&lt;/b&gt;: A parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy has been designed based on a drug&#8208;sandwiched metal&#8211;organic framework (EsMOF) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The catalytic MOF can initiate dual Fenton reactions to generate abundant &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH. Through MOF&#8208;catalyzed &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH generation and GSH depletion&#8208;inactive GPX4, the catalytic nanomedicine can effectively inhibit tumor growth, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell&#8208;death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between the MOF layers with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide as spacers. In a tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs through glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide, while erastin&#8208;aggravated glutathione depletion down&#8208;regulated glutathione peroxidase 4; this then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy that effectively inhibited tumor growth in live mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The long and bright path of a lanthanide MOF: from the basics towards the application.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable, reliable, and low&#8208;cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non&#8208;trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. We chose cotton as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity, which together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb&#8208;BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. We identified crystalline phase changes that correlated to structural information. Finally, we used the Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response up to 10ppm and 0.8ppm detection limit making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8208;carbenium interaction present in these complexes.&#160; Here, we show that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9&#8208; N &#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au &#8211; Acr distance.&#160; Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O &#8211; carbenium interaction.&#160; These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.&#160; These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of weak bases and mild conditions is currently the most sustainable and attractive synthetic approach for the preparation of Late&#8208;Transition metal complexes, some of which are widely used in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we report the first examples of the use of continuous flow reactors for the preparation of Cu(I), Au(I) and Pd(II)&#8208;NHC complexes using as starting materials cuprate, aurate or palladate species and a microreactor containing a weak base, K 2 CO 3&#160; . All reactions examined proceed under extremely mild conditions and make use of technical grade acetone as solvent. The scalability of the process was exemplified in a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of [Cu(IPr)Cl].</dc:description>

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Hydrogen Bonding Templates the Formation of a Highly Strained Covalent Organic Cage Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a&#160;  meta  &#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2&#8217;&#8208;position. Usually, a 120&#176; bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here we show that introduction of the benzoic acid group leads to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and&#160;  1  H,&#160;  13  C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen&#8208;bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.</dc:description>

Here we show that introduction of the benzoic acid group leads to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and&#160;  1  H,&#160;  13  C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen&#8208;bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a Re(I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength&#8208;selective ON/OFF ratio. The system we explore is a&#160;  fac  &#8208; [ Re(CO)  3  (TTF&#8208;DPPZ)Cl ] &#160;complexe, where TTF&#8208;DPPZ = 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[  i  ]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;  a  :2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;  c  ]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC&#8208;Stark spectroscopy confirm the presence of two distinct optically active charge&#8208;transfer processes, namely a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements show that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long&#8208;lived&#160;  3  MLCT state is observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remains as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp&#8208;H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various &#960; bonds. Recently we disclosed the first cases where SCBs reacted with both C  sp2  &#8208;H and C  sp3  &#8208;H &#963; bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, we report that SCB is also an efficient reagent for C  sp  &#8208;H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium catalysed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a C  sp  &#8208;Si functionality. Our preliminary studied suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of C  sp  &#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides composed of Square&#8208;Planar Au(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis &#8208;[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of the previously reported AuSiP that exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis via electron localization function (ELF) suggests covalent 2c&#8208;2e Tt&#8208;Pn bonds, and 3&#8208;center Au&#8208;Tt &#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn &#8208;Au bonds with 1.6 e  &#8208;  /bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies support the covalent and not ionic nature of Au&#8208;Pn and Au&#8208;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities of the materials development based on Au tetrel pnictides.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the local reaction environment during high turnover carbon dioxide reduction with Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electro&#173;chemical reactions that involve the production of OH &#8208; and the con&#173;sumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide re&#173;duction reaction (CO 2 RR) which together with the competing hydro&#173;gen evolution reaction exert changes in the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activi&#173;ty which in turn can possibly affect activity, stability and selectivity of the CO 2 RR. We determine the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activity in close proximity to a CO 2 converting Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt&#8208;nano&#173;sensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear&#173;force&#8208;based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves allowing to monitor changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt&#8208;tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#160;M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.</dc:description>

N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1&#8242;  &#8210;  5&#8242;  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. While  1&#8242;  and  3  &#8242;  &#8722;  5&#8242;  exhibited type I adsorption isotherms of CO  2  at 195 K,  2&#8242;  showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO  2  .

MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue light emissions in water suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26  &#956;  M, respectively, and the Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (  K  sv  ) of 2.93 &#215; 10  3  , 1.79 &#215; 10  3  , 3.78 &#215; 10  3  , 4.04 &#215; 10  3  , and 3.21 &#215; 10  3  M  &#8722;1  , respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@  3  , has provided direct evidences to ensure the binding sites, which show strong host&#8210;guest &#960;&#8210;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions for benefiting donor&#8211;acceptor electron&#8208;transfer to result in fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance, since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Low&#8208;Coordinate [Fe&#8722;S&#8722;Fe] Unit in Three Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] subunit with a single sulfide bridging two low&#8208;coordinate iron ions is the supposed active site of the iron&#8208;molybdenum co&#8208;factor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase. Here we report a dinuclear monosulfido bridged diiron(II) complex with a similar complex geometry that can be oxidized stepwise to diiron(II/III) and diiron(III/III) complexes while retaining the [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] core. The series of complexes has been characterized crystallographically, and electronic structures have been studied using, inter alia,  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Further, cleavage of the [Fe&#8722;S&#8722;Fe] unit by CS  2  is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal&#8208;Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC = 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC and MIL&#8208;53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large &#208; values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (pXRD), UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co&#8208;catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether&#8208;aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Not Carbon s&#8211;p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp. Our quantum&#8208;chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above&#8208;mentioned shortening in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of&#160; s &#8208;character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp. Our quantum&#8208;chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect.

         <title>Air Stable Iridium Catalysts for Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea&#8208;phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5 mol.% loading with high selectivity towards primary amines. One of the complexes was found to be active in both the Leuckart&#8208;Wallach (NH4CO2H) type reaction as well as in the hydrogenative (H2/NH4AcO) reductive amination. The protocol with ammonium formate does not require an inert atmosphere, dry solvents, as well as additives and in contrast to previous reports takes place in HFIP instead of methanol. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine &#945;&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure nucleation of low&#8208;density polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New polymorphs &#946; and &#947; of bis&#8208;3&#8208;nitrophenyl disulphide, crystallized above 0.3 GPa, are less dense than the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph &#945;. This counterinitiative density relation results from the high&#8208;entropy nucleation and subsequent kinetic crystallization. The work performed by pressure compensates the high entropy and temperature product, substantiated in varied conformers and increased chemical potential. Pressure&#8208;increased viscosity promotes the kinetic polymorphs, in accordance with empirical Ostwald&#8217;s rule of stages. It contrasts to mechanochemical techniques, favouring high&#8208;density polymorphs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Uncommon Fluorescent Recognition Mechanism Towards Pertechnetate Using a Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic AIE Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of most problematic radionuclides, technetium&#8208;99, mainly in the form of anionic pertechnetate (TcO4&#8208;), exhibits high environmental mobility, long half&#8208;life and radioactive hazard. Due to low charge density and high hydrophobicity for this tetrahedral anion, it is extremely difficult to recognize it in water. Seeking efficient and selective recognition method for TcO4&#8208; is still a big challenge. Herein, we reported a new water&#8208;stable cationic metal&#8208;organic framework (ZJU&#8208;X8) bearing tetraphenylethylene pyrimidine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ligands and attainable silver sites for TcO4&#8208; detection. ZJU&#8208;X8 underwent an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens and exhibited splendid selectivity towards TcO4&#8208;. Such uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism was well elucidated by the batch sorption experiments and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. It is found that only TcO4&#8208; could enter into the body of ZJU&#8208;X8 through anion exchange whereas other competing anions were excluded outside. Subsequently, after interaction between TcO4&#8208; and silver ions, the electron polarizations from pyrimidine rings to Ag+ cations significantly lowered the energy level of the &#960;* orbital and thus reduced the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* energy gap, resulting in a red&#8208;shift in the fluorescent spectra.</dc:description>
