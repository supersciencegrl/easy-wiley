         <dc:description>M&#8208;HAT isomerization is a highly reliable method to access thermodynamically stable alkenes with high functional group tolerance. However, synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes by M&#8208;HAT isomerization reaction is still underdeveloped.

         <title>Bromobenzene transforms lanthanoid pseudo&#8208;Grignard chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanoid pseudo&#8208;Grignard reagents PhLnBr (Ln = Sm, Eu and Yb) can be easily prepared by the oxidative addition of bromobenzene (PhBr) with lanthanoid metals in tetrahydrofuran (THF). PhLnBr reacts with bulky N,N&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) formamidine (DippFormH) to generate LnII complexes, namely [Ln(DippForm)Br(thf)3]2&#215;6thf&#160; (1; Sm, 2; Eu), and [Yb(DippForm)Br(thf)2]2&#215;2thf (3; Yb). Samarium and europium (in 1 and 2) are seven coordinate, whereas ytterbium (in 3) is six coordinate, and all are bromine&#8208;bridged dimers. When PhLnBr reacts with 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole (Ph2pzH), both divalent (5; [Eu(Ph2pz)2(thf)4]) and trivalent (4 a; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(thf)3]&#215;3thf, 4b; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(dme)2]&#215;dme) complexes are obtained. In the monomeric compounds 4(a, b), samarium is nine coordinate but europium is eight coordinate in 5. The use of PhLnBr in this work transforms the outcomes from earlier reactions of PhLnI.</dc:description>

         <title>A brick&#8208;wall topological 2D covalent organic framework constructed from an H&#8208;shaped &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an emerging porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H&#8208;shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self&#8208;polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole&#8208;based COF (H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF) with a rarely reported &#8220;brick&#8208;wall&#8221; topology. H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF displayed high crystallinity, nano&#8208;sized porosity, large BET surface area of 507 m2 g&#8208;1, and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Interestingly, H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF based membranes showed selective permeability towards different solvents related to the size and polarity of the guest molecule. Additionally, initial study suggested the COF displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes, e.g. chromium black T (99.7%) and rhodamine B (97.3%). This work provides insights into developing new topological COFs by designing monomers with new configuration.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aromatic ring fusion on BODIPY core can effectively tune its electronic property, and red&#8208;shift the absorption and emission wavelength. In this work, we report that a one&#8208;pot Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C&#8208;H activation to access acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs though the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsubstituted&#8208;BODIPYs and 1,8&#8208;dibromonaphthalenes. These newly synthesized acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs revealed intensified deep red absorptions (639 &#8208; 669 nm) and emissions (643 &#8208; 683 nm), with high fluorescence quantum yields (0.53 &#8208; 0.84) in dichloromethane. Notably, these acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs exhibited well&#8208;defined self&#8208;aggregation behavior in water/THF mixture, and for instance, the absorption of 3a was red&#8208;shifted by 53 to 693 nm after forming&#160;aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical Behavior of Self&#8208;Organizing Derivatives of 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;Vertex p&#8208;Carboranes, and their Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane and Benzene Analogues</title>

Electronic spectroscopy and DFT analyses demonstrate greater electronic interactions with &#960; substituents for 10&#8208; than 12&#8208;vertex sigma aromatic carborane.







Abstract
Four series of isostructural derivatives of 3&#8208;ring liquid crystalline derivatives containing p&#8208;carboranes (12&#8208;vertex A, and 10&#8208;vertex B), bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (C), or benzene (D) as the variable structural element were investigated for their mesogenic behavior and electronic interactions. Comparative studies demonstrated that the effectiveness of elements A&#8211;D in stabilization of the mesophase typically increases in the order: B&lt;A&lt;C&lt;D. Absorption and emission spectroscopy for the four series and reference compounds augmented with DFT computational results revealed that the degree of electronic interactions with the connected benzene &#960; system increases in the order C&lt;A&lt;B&lt;D. Emission spectra exhibit large Stokes&#8217; shifts for 10&#8208;vertex derivatives (B) in solutions and in the solid state. Spectroscopic characterization was supplemented with polarization electronic spectroscopy and solvatochromic studies of selected series. Overall, 12&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane A acts as an electron withdrawing auxochromic substituent with interactions similar to those of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, although capable of accepting some electron density in the excited state. In contrast, 10&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane B is much more interactive with the &#960;&#8208;aromatic electron manifold and exhibits greater ability to participate in photo&#8208;induced CT processes. Absorption and emission energies and quantum yields (1&#8208;51&#8201;%) for carborane derivatives, representing the D&#8722;A&#8722;D system, were compared to those of their isoelectronic zwitterionic analogues (the A&#8722;D&#8722;A system). The analysis is supplemented with four single&#8208;crystal XRD structures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four series of isostructural derivatives of 3-ring liquid crystalline derivatives containing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-carboranes (12-vertex &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;, and 10-vertex &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;), bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;), or benzene (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;) as the variable structural element were investigated for their mesogenic behavior and electronic interactions.

Absorption and emission spectroscopy for the four series and reference compounds augmented with DFT computational results revealed that the degree of electronic interactions with the connected benzene &#960; system increases in the order &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;. Emission spectra exhibit large Stokes&#8217; shifts for 10-vertex derivatives (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) in solutions and in the solid state. Spectroscopic characterization was supplemented with polarization electronic spectroscopy and solvatochromic studies of selected series. Overall, 12-vertex &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-carborane &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; acts as an electron withdrawing auxochromic substituent with interactions similar to those of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, although capable of accepting some electron density in the excited state.

         <title>Selective Construction of Molecular Borromean Rings and [2]Catenane Utilizing Ether Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of discrete Cp* Rh&#8208;based structures were constructed by selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium (III) bimetallic construction units. This study demonstrates a strategy to convert a binuclear D&#8208;shaped to a [2]catenane by changing the length of bridged ligands. Selective synthesis of [2]catenane and molecular Borromean rings can be achieved under similar conditions.







Abstract
A series of Cp*Rh&#8208;based discrete architectures was constructed by selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium(III) bimetallic construction units, respectively. This study demonstrates a strategy for making the transition from a binuclear D&#8208;shaped ring to a tetranuclear [2]catenane by adjusting the length of bipyridyl ligands. In addition, changing the position on the naphthyl group of the bipyridyl ligand from 2,6&#8208; to 1,5&#8208;position substitution can realize the selective synthesis of [2]catenane and Borromean rings under similar conditions. The above&#8208;mentioned constructions have been determined via X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, detailed NMR techniques, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry analysis, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Elucidating Conformational Dynamics and Thermostability of Designed Aromatic Clusters Using Protein Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic residues form clusters in proteins and play essential roles in biological systems. However, the stabilization mechanism and dynamic behavior of aromatic clusters remain unclear. Here, we describe designed aromatic interactions confined within a protein cage to reveal how aromatic clusters affect protein stability. The crystal structures and calorimetric measurements indicate that the formation of inter&#8208;subunit phenylalanine clusters enhance the interactions of inter&#8208;helices and increase the melting temperature. Theoretical calculations suggest that this is caused by the transformation of the T&#8208;shaped geometry into &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking at high temperatures, and the hydration entropic gain. Thus, the isolated nano&#8208;environment in a protein cage allows reconstruction and detailed analysis of multiple clustering residues for elucidating the mechanisms of various biomolecular interactions in nature which can be applied to design of bionanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Vacancy in Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the formation of transition metal (TM) vacancy, vacancy contained configurations for triggering oxygen redox, advanced characterization techniques for detecting TM vacancy and viable strategies to improve the reversibility of vacancy&#8208;induced oxygen redox for layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Anionic redox has been considered as a promising strategy to break the capacity limitation of cathode materials that solely relies on the intrinsic cationic redox in secondary batteries. Vacancy, as a kind of defect, can be introduced into transition metal layer to trigger oxygen redox, thus enhancing the energy density of layer&#8208;structured cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the formation process, recent progress in working mechanisms of triggering oxygen redox, as well as advanced characterization techniques for transition metal (TM) vacancy were overviewed and discussed. Strategies applied to stabilize the vacancy contained structures and harness the reversible oxygen redox were summarized. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for further understanding TM vacancy were particularly emphasized.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Transfer Dynamics of Organic Polymer Nanoparticles with Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>

Poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene nanoparticles with graphene oxide (p3ht NPs&#8208;GO &amp; p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO) were prepared, and revealed the properties of charge transfer complexes. Notably, ultrafast electron transfer in those composites was reported for the first time, and faster electron transfer in p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have higher application values for organic polymer solar cells.







Abstract
We prepared organic polymer poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (p3ht) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide (GO)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO by using the reprecipitation method. We demonstrated that GO/RGO could improve the ordering and planarity of p3ht chains as well as the formation of p3ht NPs, and confirmed the effects of GO/RGO on the fluorescence and carrier transport dynamics of p3ht NPs by using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) techniques. Ultrafast electron transfer (&#8764;1&#8197;ps) between GO/RGO and p3ht NPs quenched the fluorescence of p3ht NPs, indicating excellent properties of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO as the charge transfer complexes. Efficient electron transfer may promote the applications of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO composites in organic polymer solar cells and photocatalysis. Moreover, RGO had stronger interfacial interactions and more matched conduction band energy levels with p3ht NPs than GO did, which implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have greater application values than p3ht NPs&#8208;GO.

         <title>Tris(boranil) Columnar Liquid Crystalline Fluorophores: pseudo&#8208;Triphenylene Boron(III) Complexes with Peripheral N&#8722;B&#8722;O Linkages</title>

Photoluminescent tris(boranil) discotics derived from tris&#8208;anils exhibit room temperature columnar mesomorphism, and redox behavior.







Abstract
The borate complexes derived from salicylaldimine ligands, called boranils, possess a wide range of photophysical and electronic characteristics intrinsically. The unique combination of molecular rigidity, rendered by four&#8208;coordinate boron bridges, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation enable them to serve as technically feasible fluorescent materials (dyes). The incorporation of liquid crystallinity in these boron(III) complexes, especially the columnar (Col) mesomorphism, which is overlooked hitherto, would provide a new dimension to these complexes. Herein, we report the first examples of tris(boranil) discotic liquid crystal (LC) dyes that have been readily synthesized by treating tris(N&#8208;salicylideneaniline)s, (TSAN)s, with BF3.Et2O in the presence of an acid quencher. These C3&#8208;symmetric borate complexes self&#8208;assemble into the Col phase, existing over a wide thermal span including room temperature. The 2D periodic order of the Col phases shows dependence on the length of the peripheral tails. The photophysical measurements reveal the fluorescence emission in their two condensed states viz., solid and Col phase, and in solution. Their electrochemical, two&#8208;step oxidation process coupled with the aforesaid features upholds their significance in applied research.

However, most of the current syntheses involve a multi&#8208;step approach and the stepwise introduction of the chiral centres. Herein, we describe a one&#8208;step, highly diastereoselective method to furnish derivatives of these compounds via a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of cyclic and acyclic chiral sulfinylimines.







Abstract
Herein, we present a highly diastereoselective method to furnish acyclic 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diol derivatives using a tandem double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko protocol (dr up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1) using a butanone derived sulfinylimine. In most cases only 1 diastereomer predominates, from a possible 16. The reaction is also regioselective. In addition, the highly challenging cyclobutanone and 3&#8208;pentanone derivatives are also amenable to a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction, although the dr values are modest. Despite that, clean single diastereomers can be isolated, which should prove very useful in medicinal chemistry and other areas. Detailed DFT calculations support the observed stereoselectivities in all cases, providing a rationale for the excellent dr values in the butanone series and the moderate values for the 3&#8208;pentanone class.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of ESIPT in a Systematically Constructed Series of Benzimidazole Based Schiff Base Probes: Application as Chemosensors</title>

Chemosensors: The combined effect of ESIPT and C=N isomerization in benzimidazole and the substituted aminobenzoic acids bearing Schiff base probes is responsible for different spectral output in solid and solution states. Furthermore, these ESIPT active chemosensors can sense Cu2+ through the inhibition of keto&#8208;enol tautomerisation.







Abstract
Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8211;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8722;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2 N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;Driven Reactivity of a Dinuclear Copper Dimethylglyoxime Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First check your solvent: In a dinuclear dimethylglyoxime copper(II) complex, hydrolysis of one ligand is facilitated by the cooperative effect of both CuII ions. Hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH; depending on the solvent used, the latter is either oxidized to N2O (in CH3CN) or reduced to NH4+ (in ethanol). A combined approach of experimental, theoretical, and spectroscopic methods allowed the reaction mechanism to be suggested.







Abstract
In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1), which, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increases the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that, depending on the solvent, is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as the oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Calix[6]arene Pseudorotaxane Empowered by Fluorophoric Dansyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, composed by a dansyl calix[6]arene and a bipyridinium axle, is presented. The disassembly of this complex can be triggered by: i) protonation of the dansyl units (chemical stimulus); ii) electrochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit (electrochemical stimulus); iii) photochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit, enabled by photoinduced electron transfer from the dansyl units (light stimulus). Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be employed to control the stability of this novel pseudorotaxane.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization, by means of NMR and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques, of a dansyl calix[6]arene derivative and of its pseudorotaxane complex with a bipyridinium&#8208;based axle. This novel macrocycle shows remarkable complexation ability, in analogy with parent compounds, while the dansyl moieties impart valuable features to the system. Indeed, these units: i) signal the state of the system by fluorescence; ii) can be reversibly protonated, enabling the modulation of the complexation abilities of the macrocycle; iii) participate in photoinduced electron transfer processes, which may be exploited to tune the stability of the supramolecular complex. Therefore, in this multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, the threading and de&#8208;threading motions of the molecular components can be modulated either by protonation of the calixarene host or by reduction of the bipyridinium guest, which can be accomplished both by electrochemical reduction and via photoinduced electron transfer. Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be used to induce molecular movements of the pseudorotaxane components.

From diquat to dye&#8208;cat. A series of push&#8211;pull dyes using diquat as the electron&#8208;acceptor moiety have been synthesized. Their photocatalytic abilities were tested in the aerobic thiocyanation of indoles and pyrroles, giving yields of up to 97&#8201;%.







Abstract

         <title>Aqueous Binders Compatible with Ionic Liquid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suitability of aqueous binders for aluminum ion batteries (AIBs), especially the compatibility with ionic liquids and the distribution on the cathode surface, is systematically investigated. Typically, AIBs with sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) as binder exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability.







Abstract
The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8722;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.

         <title>C versus O Protonation in Zincate Anions: A Simple Gas&#8208;Phase Model for the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why do organozinc reagents survive instantaneous protolysis in protic media? A gas&#8208;phase model shows that the protonation of the organyl group, although thermodynamically strongly favored, is outcompeted by the protonation of a hydroxy ligand.







Abstract
For better understanding the intrinsic reactivity of organozinc reagents, we have examined the protolysis of the isolated zincate ions Et3Zn&#8722;, Et2Zn(OH)&#8722;, and Et2Zn(OH)2Li&#8722; by 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol in the gas phase. The protonation of the hydroxy groups and the release of water proceed much more efficiently than the protonation of the ethyl groups and the liberation of ethane. Quantum&#8208;chemical computations and statistical&#8208;rate theory calculations fully reproduce the experimental findings and attribute the lower reactivity of the more basic ethyl moiety to higher intrinsic barriers, which override the thermodynamic preference for its protonation. Thus, our minimalistic gas&#8208;phase model provides evidence for the intrinsically low reactivity of organozinc reagents toward proton donors and helps to explain their remarkable kinetic stability against moisture and even protic media.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation Relay (CHAR) of Proline Ester Derivatives Promoted by In Situ Triarylamine Radical Cation: Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Bromopyrrole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR) of proline esters was realized by the in&#8197;situ generated tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)amine radical cation, selectively constructing the skeleton of 4&#8208;bromopyrrole under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Using the in&#8197;situ generated triarylamine radical cation as an initiator, the sp3 C&#8722;H bond of proline esters was smoothly oxidized and brominated through C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR), giving a series of 4&#8208;bromopyrroles in good yields with high regioselectivity. The mechanistic study revealed that the oxidation of the active C&#8722;H bond initiated the followed 1,5&#8208;HAT and bromination, which provides a new method to realize the functionalization of the remote C&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow in Fluoranthene&#8208;Containing Dopant&#8208;Matrix Systems: From Conventional Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence to Efficient Red TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents the transformation from conventional room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence to efficient red TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. Red TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials with afterglow efficiency up to 13.1&#8201;% and afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s have been achieved, which paves the way for afterglow materials&#8217; applications in diverse areas.







Abstract
It remains challenging to fabricate highly&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;lived organic afterglow materials, especially in the case of red afterglow systems. Here we develop advanced charge transfer (CT) technology to boost afterglow efficiency and lifetimes in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. First, organic CT molecules possess singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) of around 0.5&#8197;eV, much smaller than localized excitation systems. Second, upon doping into suitable organic matrices, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between 1CT states and organic matrices reduce 1CT levels with less effect on 3CT levels, and thus further narrow &#916;EST and enhance intersystem crossing. Third, the rigid planar structure of fluoranthene groups and the rigid microenvironment provided by organic matrices can suppress phosphorescence quenching. Forth, the multiple donor design enables spectral red&#8208;shifts to red region and switches on TADF mechanism to improve afterglow efficiency to 13.1&#8201;% and maintain afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s. Such high&#8208;performance afterglow materials have been rarely explored in reported studies.

Two heterometal polyphosphorus compounds with cyclo&#8208;P3 and norborane&#8208;P7 skeletons were formed by intramolecular cooperative yttrium hydride/LiPPh2 mediated activation of P4, while a pyramid&#8208;like P(PH)3 moiety was constructed from P4 functionalization using single metal specie (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2.







Abstract
The rare&#8208;earth/lithium cooperative effect on functionalization of white phosphorus has been investigated. The reaction of diazabutadiene&#8208;supported yttrium hydride chelated a LiPPh2 molecule (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2[&#956;&#8208;PPh2(Li)] (1, L=N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene) with P4 gave two novel mixed Y/Li multinuclear polyphosphorus complexes (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2[cyclo&#8208;P3]Li(THF)3 (2) and [Li(THF)4]+[(LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(norborane&#8208;P7)Li(THF)]&#8722; (3), accompanied with the elimination of diphosphorus compound Ph2PPPh2 (4) and H2. However, the comparative reaction of yttrium hydride (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2 with P4 afforded a trinuclear yttrium pyramid&#8208;P4 complex (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(&#956;3&#8208;P(PH)3) (5). Further investigations show that 5 cannot continuously react with LiPPh2 to form 2 and 3, and LiPPh2 reacted with P4 to form a Zintl&#8208;P7 lithium complex (TMEDA&#8901;Li)3(Zintl&#8208;P7) (6) and 4. These results indicated that the cooperation of Y/Li for activation of P4 is a key for the formation of 2 and 3. All new compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Zinc Substituted Myoglobin&#8722;Albumin Fusion Protein: A Photosensitizer for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>

Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin, Mb&#8208;HSA, was prepared using a yeast host cell with secretion into the culture medium. The heme of Mb&#8208;HSA was replaced with a zinc protoporphyrin IX, yielding ZnMb&#8208;HSA. This fluorescent fusion protein showed a superior activity of photodynamic cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro. Its blood circulation half&#8208;life was 11&#8208;fold longer than free ZnMb in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin (Mb&#8208;HSA) can be produced using yeast Pichia pastoris as a host strain, with secretion into the culture medium. This Mb&#8208;HSA fusion protein possesses identical O2 binding affinity to that of naked Mb. The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)&#8208;HSA, ZnMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O2 generation ability of ZnMb&#8208;HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb. In vitro cell experiments revealed that ZnMb&#8208;HSA acts as a superior photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy. It is noteworthy that ZnMb&#8208;HSA shows long circulation lifetime in&#8197;vivo.

Indirect oxidative dehydrogenation: Introduction of appropriate amount of Zn onto ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite resulted in highly dispersed and active site for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH), structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were systematically investigated.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) is a major chemical for the modern society, and new technologies for its production are of strategic importance globally. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C2H4 production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attention. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM&#8208;5 supported Zn system, i.&#8201;e., ZnZSM&#8208;5, which showed great promise in CO2&#8208;ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM&#8208;5 at 700&#8201;&#176;C and a CO2:C2H6 feeding ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1. During 340&#8197;min TOS, the C2H6 conversion decreased moderately from 36.2&#8201;% to 23.1&#8201;%, and the C2H4 yield stabilized at 21.9&#8201;% to 27.9&#8201;%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.

Coordination polymers: The combination of the rigid, aromatic dinitrile isomers ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4, the pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR=Cp*, Cp&#8217;&#8217;; Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3) with different steric demands and a silver salt with a non&#8208;coordinating anion SbF6&#8722; gives a unique view into how those building blocks can influence a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly system giving rise to various 1D/2D/3D&#8208;coordination polymers.







Abstract
Pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) (A), Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3 (B)) are excellent building blocks for polymeric assemblies in supramolecular chemistry in combination with coinage metal salts of weakly coordinating anions such as AgSbF6. Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4 in a one&#8208;pot reaction between [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and AgSbF6 leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)2C6H4 play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs. All CPs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

&lt;p&gt;Pentaphosphaferrocenes [Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (Cp*=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;), Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;tBu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-1,3 (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;)) are excellent building blocks for polymeric assemblies in supramolecular chemistry in combination with coinage metal salts of weakly coordinating anions such as AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles &lt;i&gt;ortho/meta/para&lt;/i&gt;-(NC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a one-pot reaction between [Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] and AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three-component self-assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs. All CPs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zigzag&#8208;Edged Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Benzo[m]tetraphene Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>

A modular synthetic strategy was developed to achieve zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation from &#8220;U&#8208;shaped&#8221; benzo[m]tetraphene&#8208;based precursors. The experimental and theoretical investigations elucidated the edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent effect on the electronic structures and optical properties. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy disclosed the modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension.







Abstract
A series of zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Z1&#8208;Z3) were synthesized from 2,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;benzo[m]tetraphene (9) as a versatile building block. Their structures were unambiguously confirmed by laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, Raman, and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies as well as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fingerprint vibrational modes were elucidated with theoretical support. The edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent optical properties were characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed distinct modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension from Z1 to Z2, the latter having a gulf edge.

         <title>Cyclic or Linear? Parameters Determining the Outcome of Glycine Polymerization in Silica Surface Prebiotic Scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic or linear? The parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization on silica surface are studied through monomers deposition from both gas and liquid phases. The results showed that the density of the nearly&#8208;free silanols NFS is a crucial parameter to predict the formation of linear or cyclic polymers when Gly is deposited from gas phase. For liquid phase deposition, Gly deposited in its zwitterionic form could isomerize to its neutral form and readsorb on the silanol&#8208;Gly esters to form linear peptides besides DKP.Please consider the following revised version of TOC







Abstract
The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density&#8804;0.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5&#8197;nm&#8722;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.

         <title>Melt Castable Derivatives of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic materials: In this work, the pentaerythritol backbone was modified with amine, nitramine and tetrazole functionalities leading to powerful melt castable pentaerythritol tetranitrate derivatives that outperform TNT. Exciting insights into the influence of these functionalities on mechanical sensitivities and melting behavior are observed and discussed.







Abstract
In the search for high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, the derivatization of known materials is an often&#8208;applied concept to fulfill modern&#8208;day demands. Surprisingly, the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or pharmaceutics. In this work, the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structurally similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalizations result in melting points in the range of 64 to 126&#8201;&#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Evolution Control and Luminescence Regulation in Multiple&#8208;Site Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;polarity effect on the framework/luminescence regulation was demonstrated based on the multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks: distinct electrostatic forces controlled by solvent polarities (high/low) would benefit for the different framework (cage/channel) structures; the solvent polarity could further adjust the conformation of organic building unit to generate a broadband tunable luminescence.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host&#8208;guest chemistry, however, the pre&#8208;design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents&#8242; participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity&#8208;evolution&#8208;controlled framework/luminescence regulation is demonstrated based on multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High&#8208;polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low&#8208;polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen&#8208;bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs. These results pave the way for the rational design of ideal HOFs with on&#8208;demand framework regulation and luminescence properties.

         <title>Enabling Long&#8208;Lived Polymeric Room Temperature Phosphorescence Material in Abominable Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent material was achieved based on the rigid structure provided by aromatic and piperidine rings of mBPipQ and the dense molecular arrangement of an epoxy resin, which stabilized triplet excitons. More importantly, these materials exhibit stable yellow&#8208;green phosphorescence emission after being immersed in strong acid or alkali solutions for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have drawn more attention due to their convenient preparation process and equally efficient phosphorescence performance in recent years. As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non&#8208;covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2&#8197;times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10&#8197;days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission. Utilizing the efficient phosphorescence emission and excellent abominable&#8208;solvent resistance of this RTP material, multilevel information encryption has been successfully demonstrated. This work broadens the application scope of polymeric RTP materials in harsh environments and provides a new idea for achieving efficient RTP emission.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts by Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported. The keys to this advancement are: 1) one&#8208;pot, mild reaction conditions; 2) broad substrate scope; and 3) selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization.







Abstract
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.

         <title>Copper (I) Chloride&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Synthesis of Multifunctionalized Compounds at Room Temperature and Their Antifungal Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and highly efficient copper photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of BQ, alkyl/aryl alcohols, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes forms highly functionalized products at room temperature. The late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good anti&#8208;Candida krusei and anti&#8208;Candida glabrata activities with lower cytotoxicities than that of fluconazole, the standard antifungal medicine.







Abstract
A simple visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced CuCl&#8208;catalyzed synthesis was developed for highly functionalized carbon&#8208;centered compounds (&#945;&#8208;alk/aryloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diaryl/alkylaryl&#8208;acetaldehydes/ketones) at room temperature using benzoquinone, alkyl/aryl alcohol, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes. Late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good antifungal activities, especially against Candida krusei fungal strain, in in&#8197;vitro experiments (the Broth microdilution method). Moreover, toxicity tests (zebrafish egg model experiments) indicated that these compounds had negligible cytotoxicity. The green chemistry metrics (E&#8208;factor value is 7.3) and eco&#8208;scale (eco&#8208;scale value is 58.8) evaluations show that the method is simple, mild, highly efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and environmentally feasible.

         <title>A Cu+/Thiourea Dendrimer Achieves Excellent Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Enhanced Cell Uptake and Endosome Escape</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cuprous (I) ions coordinated polymer was synthesized via the coordination of phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer with either cuprous&#8197;(I) ions or copper&#8197;(II) ions, since the copper&#8197;(II) ions in the coordination polymer was reduced to cuprous&#8197;(I) ions. The coordinated polymer facilitates the protein binding, cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and thus enables efficient protein delivery.







Abstract
Intracellular protein delivery has attracted considerable attention in the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutics, however, the design of highly efficient materials for robust delivery of native proteins remains challenging. This study proposes a Cu+ &#8208;based coordination polymer for cytosolic protein delivery with high efficacy and robustness. The phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer is coordinated with cuprous ions to prepare the polymeric carrier, which efficiently bind cargo proteins via a combination of coordination, ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The incorporation of Cu+ ions in the polymer greatly improves its cellular uptake and endosomal escape. The cuprous&#8208;based coordination polymer successfully delivered a variety of structurally diverse proteins into various cell lines with reserved bioactivities. This study provides a new type of coordination polymers for cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal catalyst&#8208;dependent divergent cascade reaction of alkyne&#8208;embedded diazoketones with indoles is reported, which offers expeditious access to benzo[i]phenanthridines and benzo[b]carbazoles in good yield under mild reaction conditions. N&#8208;embedded dienophiles are used rather than alkynes or olefins for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.







Abstract
An Ag/Au&#8208;catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in&#8197;situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8722;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters by Using a DNA Scaffold</title>

Not just any which way: Circularly polarized luminescence from a pyrene cluster in DNA duplexes has been systematically investigated. CPL properties varied depending not only on the distance but also on the relative orientation between two pyrene dimers.







Abstract
We have investigated the chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on d&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives were prepared. The homodimers of 1&#8208; and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, thus indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here could lead to the development of bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.

Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) depends on orientation. The DNA helix is depicted as a spiral staircase on which chromophore people stand. The CPL intensity, which is shown as helical light, varies depending not only on the distance between chromophores but also on their relative orientation. Helical structures of DNA duplexes are also illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kashida, H. Asanuma, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300182).

From diquat to dye&#8208;cat: More than just a herbicide, the reversibly reducible diquat moiety now harnesses the power of the sun. Incorporated into donor&#8211;acceptor dyes we developed, as well as into charge&#8211;transfer complexes we observed, diquat is enabled to absorb visible light. This allowed the use of these systems in the photocatalytic thiocyanation of various indoles and pyrroles, with air as the oxidant. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Wilhelm and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203541).

         <title>Cover Feature: Cooperativity&#8208;Driven Reactivity of a Dinuclear Copper Dimethylglyoxime Complex (Chem. Eur. J. 22/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperativity at the crossroad: The two copper centers in the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime complex work in concert to facilitate ligand hydrolysis that yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH. The fate of NH2OH depends on the solvent used, in CH3CN, for example, NH2OH is oxidized to N2O yielding [Cu(CH3CN)4]+ as reduced species. In ethanol, however, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, which in turn yields acetaldehyde as oxidized species. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203438).

         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chirality triggered by unpolarized light and circularly polarized light is systematically discussed. The unpolarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by various photoactive components. Besides, circularly polarized light can directly induce the supramolecular charity in organic and inorganic systems or their hybridized systems. It is anticipated that this review can advance the development of more responsive chiral functional nanomaterials. For more details, see the Review by F. Yang, B. Yue, and L. Zhu (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203794).

         <title>Frontispiece: Induced CPL&#8208;Active Materials Based on Chiral Supramolecular Co&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. Chiral supramolecular assembly processes can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. More information can be found in the Review article by W. Zheng, Y. Cheng and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204039).

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Modulation of Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered supramolecular chiral assemblies have aroused great attention. According to the different interaction ways between light and system, we mainly summarized non&#8208;polarized light and circularly polarized light (CP light) triggered chiral assemblies. Non&#8208;polarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by the introduction of photoactive components. As a chiral light source, CP light can directly induce the asymmetric assembly of organic molecules and asymmetric photosynthesis of inorganic metal nanostructures. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. Furthermore, many relevant functional applications were also presented.







Abstract
Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.&#8201;g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene) or photo&#8208;induced directionally rotating molecular motors were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of circularly polarized light have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.

Chiral supramolecular assembly processes can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. This review summarizes the related advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral co&#8208;assembly system, their research status and application prospects in CP&#8208;EL field, and current challenges.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. As known, dissymmetry factor (gem) of CPL is one essential factor for evaluating the features of CPL&#8208;active materials. Much attention has focused on how to increase the gem value, which is one of the most important issues for CPL practical applications. Recently, more and more works have demonstrated that chiral supramolecular could provide the significant strategy to improve the gem value through the orderly helical superstructure of chiral building blocks. Normally, this kind of chiral supramolecular assembly process can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. In this review, we fully summarized recent advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies, their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and current challenges.

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Magnetic Modulation in a Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Dyad Piezochromic Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extreme sensitivity of trivalent lanthanide ions to crystal field variations led to the emergence of single&#8208;molecule magnetic switching under various stimuli. The use of pressure as an external stimulus instead of classic light irradiation, oxidation or any chemical reactions allows a fine tuning of the magnetic modulation. Here the well&#8208;known pure isotopically enriched [162Dy(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 ( 162Dy) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) (tta&#8208; = 2&#8208;2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and L = 4,5&#8208;bis(propylthio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine) was experimentally investigated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction and squid magnetometry under high applied pressures. Both reversible piezochromic properties and pressure modulation of the SMM behavior were demonstrated and supported by ab initio calculations. The magnetic study of the diluted sample [162Dy0.05Y0.95(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 ( 162Dy@Y) indicated that variations in the electronic structure have both intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular origins. Quantitative magnetic interpretation concludes to a deterioration of the Orbach process for the benefit of both Raman and QTM mechanisms under applied pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage functionalization for the divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives by rhodium catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives was here reported from simple and readily available starting materials via Late&#8208;Stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis. This strategy utilizes the ketone and oxime in substrates as internal direacting groups and requires no external ligand or removable directing group. 75 podophyllotoxin derivatives have been obtained without any erosion of the enantiopurity, indicating the broad substrate scope of this method. Additionally, by using the newly developed strategy, 9aa can be prepared via sequential transformation, which exhibited excellent anticancer activity against eight cancer cell lines. In particularly, 9aa suppressed Hela cells with IC50 values of 74.5 nM, which provides a promising lead compound for future drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aziridines and Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of readily available aryl aziridines and aryl bromides under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions to access synthetic useful &#946;&#8209;arylethylamines is developed. This protocol is characterized by its exquisite chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the regioselectivity and reactivity observed are a result of electro&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of aziridines under electroreductive conditions to generate a benzyl radical intermediate as the active species. Furthermore, this strategy also enables cross&#8208;coupling with CO2 to access &#946;&#8209;amino acids under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogenative Reactions Using Liquid Hydrogen Donors: Mechanisms, Catalysts Design, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising approach for a wide range of hydrogenative reactions owing to the mild reaction conditions and the possibility of employing liquid hydrogen donors. Currently, the major interest is focused on the development of high performance photocatalyst materials and the expansion of reaction scope. An overview from a perspective of hydrogen donor and thus the related mechanistic understanding of the light&#8208;induced hydrogenative reactions is rare. Here, we have categorized the photocatalytic hydrogenative reactions by the type of employed liquid hydrogen donors (hydrocarbons and water), discussed the basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from these donors, and elaborated the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Requirements of a Glycolipid MPIase for Membrane Protein Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MPIase, a glycolipid, is involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. In this study, we synthesized analogs to reveal the structural requirements and glycan&#8208;length dependency for the integration and chaperone&#8208;like activity, and synergistic effects with the membrane chaperone, YidC. The structure&#8208;activity relationship study verified the mechanism for translocon&#8208;independent integration aided by MPIase.







Abstract
MPIase is a glycolipid involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. To overcome the trace amounts and heterogeneity of natural MPIase, we systematically synthesized MPIase analogs. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed the contribution of distinctive functional groups and the effect of the MPIase glycan length on membrane protein integration activity. In addition, both the synergistic effects of these analogs with the membrane chaperone/insertase YidC, and the chaperone&#8208;like activity of the phosphorylated glycan were observed. These results verified the translocon&#8208;independent membrane integration mechanism in the inner membrane of E. coli, in which MPIase captures the highly hydrophobic nascent proteins via its characteristic functional groups, prevents protein aggregation, attracts the proteins to the membrane surface, and delivers them to YidC in order to regenerate its own integration activity.

         <title>Substituent and Solvent Effect Studies of N&#8208;Alkenylnitrone 4&#960; Electrocyclizations
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making the unreactive reactive: Substituent and solvent effects for the 4&#960; electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones to azetidine nitrones have been investigated by using Hammett, Eyring, and isotope effect studies. The results of these investigations have been used to prepare previously inaccessible azetidine nitrones, identify catalysts, and establish a fundamental understanding for synthetic applications.







Abstract
The roles of substituent and solvent effects in promoting the 4&#960; electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones to give azetidine nitrones have been investigated by experimental examination of relative rates, activation energies, and linear free energy relationships. These transformations are synthetically important because they favor the formation of a strained heterocyclic ring with imbedded functionality and stereochemical information for versatile derivatization. Mechanistic investigations, including Hammett studies, solvent&#8208;dependent Eyring studies, and solvent isotope effects, provide insight into the steric and electronic factors that control these electrocyclizations and identify trends that can be used to advance this approach towards the rapid synthesis of complex azetidines.

         <title>A New Type of Valence Tautomerism in Cobalt Dioxolene Complexes &#8211; Temperature&#8208;Induced Transition from a Cobalt(III) Catecholate to a Low&#8208;Spin Cobalt(II) Semiquinonate State</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel twist in temperature&#8208;induced switching of electronic states in cobalt dioxolene complexes: Structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic results demonstrate that valence tautomerism can occur by converting a cobalt(III) catecholate into a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex instead of the usual high&#8208;spin complex.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the monocationic cobalt(III) catecholate complex [Co(L&#8208;N4tBu2)(Cl2cat)]+ (L&#8208;N4tBu2=N,N&#8217;&#8208;Di&#8208;tert.&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane, Cl2cat2&#8722;=4,5&#8208;dichlorocatecholate) are presented. The complex exhibits valence tautomeric properties in solution; but, in contrast to the usually observed conversion from a cobalt(III) catecholate to a high&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate state, valence tautomerism of [Co(L&#8208;N4tBu2)(Cl2cat)]+ leads to the formation of a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex upon raising the temperature. This new type of valence tautomerism for a cobalt dioxolene complex has been unambiguously established by a detailed spectroscopic investigation using variable&#8208;temperature NMR, IR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Determination of the enthalpies and entropies characterizing the valence tautomeric equilibria in various solutions shows that the influence of the solvent is almost exclusively entropic.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological activity: 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salt derivatives have been extensively studied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts and ligands. Meanwhile, it has also shown a wide range of highly effective bioactivities, including the activities of antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti&#8208;plasmodium and even worm growth regulation. The development and applications of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts in the development of both agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals are attractive.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salts are precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which have been extensively used as effective catalysts and ligands for both asymmetric and non&#8208;enantioselective reactions. Nevertheless, they are also a kind of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that possess amphipathic properties. The unique chemical and physical properties of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts have received significant attention from scientists focusing on the development of novel bioactive molecules as pesticides and medicines. It is timely and meaningful to summarize the bioactivities of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt derivatives against various bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and other pathogens in the past 30&#8197;years. Meanwhile, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts was also summarized. Finally, our perspective on the future development and applications of triazolium salts as agrichemicals or human drugs is presented.

         <title>Controlled Shell and Kernel Modifications of Atomically Precise Pd/Ag Superatomic Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first controlled modification of kernel and shell arrangements in Pd&#8208;doped superatomic silver clusters containing interstitial hydrides is presented. The sequential addition of individual Ag atoms to an icosahedron core results in PdH@Ag19, PdH@Ag20, and Pd@Ag21, while maintaining a 12&#8208;ligand stabilizing framework. Remarkable aqueous stability, proven by unsupported catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol was demonstrated.







Abstract
The first 8&#8208;electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp=S2P(OiPr)2&#8722;) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+ 2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55&#8201;% yield. Further modification of the shell results in the formation of [PdAg21(dtp)12]+ 3 via an internal redox reaction, with the system retaining an 8&#8208;electron superatomic configuration. The interstitial hydride in 1 and 2 contributes its 1s1 electron to the superatomic electron count and occupies a PdAg3 tetrahedron. The distributions of isomers corresponding to different dispositions of the outer capping Ag atoms are investigated by multinuclear VT&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The emissive state of 3 has a lifetime of 200&#8197;&#956;s (&#955;ex=448; &#955;em=842), while 1 and 2 are non&#8208;emissive. The catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol is demonstrated with 1&#8211;3 at room temperature.

         <title>A Template&#8208;Free Pd2L4 Cage with up to Nanomolar Affinity for Chloride in Aqueous Solutions
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide catcher: A template&#8208;free, water&#8208;soluble Pd2L4 cage that binds chloride with up to nanomolar affinity in aqueous solutions is reported here. Of the most abundant essential anions present in living organisms, this cage exclusively binds chloride. This unprecedented binding affinity/selectivity was achieved by making the best use of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Selective binding of chloride over the other most abundant anions in living organisms is pivotal due to its essential role in physiological functions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;free Pd2L4 cage exhibiting high selectivity for medium&#8208;sized halides (i.&#8201;e., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) in water owing to the size&#8208;discriminatory nature of the cage cavity. In pure water, this cage displays high selectivity and micromolar affinity for chloride. The cage shows no binding towards other biologically more abundant essential anions such as phosphates, carboxylates, or bicarbonate. This cage shows an unprecedented nanomolar affinity with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 binding stoichiometry for chloride in aqueous&#8208;DMSO media. This high affinity was achieved with the best use of traditional hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This well&#8208;defined cage sequestrates F&#8722; by cleaving a B&#8722;F bond in BF4&#8722; in a facile manner in a nonpolar solvent or in the presence of excess ligand. This cage also demonstrates capture of the sub&#8208;ppm chloride level that is present in commercial D2O samples.

         <title>Elemental Magnesium as an Early Transition Metal Substitute: From Pentafulvene Coordination to Deprotonation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surfing on the pentafulvene: The reaction of elemental magnesium and a pentafulvene indicates the formation of a magnesium pentafulvene complex as an intermediate, in a coordination mode that is only known for early transition metals. This species is interceptable in one&#8208;pot reactions with secondary amines to yield unprecedented magnesium amide half sandwich complexes.







Abstract
The reaction of magnesium turnings and 6,6&#8208;di&#8208;para&#8208;tolylpentafulvene was investigated. Under mild conditions, the magnesium dissolves, forming the MgII complex 1 with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#963;&#8208;&#954;1 coordinating ligand of the dimerized pentafulvene, analyzed by NMR and XRD investigations. As a magnesium pentafulvene complex was a possible intermediate, amines were employed as intercepting agents. Thereby, the amines were formally deprotonated by elemental magnesium, yielding the first examples of Cp'Mg(THF)2NR2 complexes. This reaction competes with the formation of 1 and a consecutive formal [1,5]&#8208;H&#8208;shift forming an ansa&#8208;magnesocene. Employing amines with low basicity gave quantitative conversion to the amide complexes.

         <title>Use of Conglomerate Mixed Crystals to Deracemize a Stable Racemic&#8208;Compound&#8208;Forming System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a deracemizable conglomerate (blue and red cubes), it is possible to substitute in the solid&#8208;state part of the blue and red enantiomers with chemically related enantiomers (green and yellow cubes) that crystallize as a racemic compound. The mirror&#8208;image solid solutions (enriched mixed crystals) could be deracemized by temperature cycling (deracemized mixed crystals). More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Coquerel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300441).

         <title>Steric Effects on the Chelation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ by Hexadentate Polyimidazole Ligands: Modeling Metal Binding by Calprotectin Site 2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of ligands that bind Mn2+ with high affinity and selectivity, but this remains a difficult challenge. It has been proposed that the cavity size of the binding pocket is a critical factor in most synthetic and biological examples of selective Mn2+ binding. Here, we use a bioinspired approach adapted from the hexahistidine binding site of the manganese&#8208;sequestering protein calprotectin to systematically study the effect of cavity size on Mn2+ and Zn2+ binding. We have designed a hexadentate, trisimidazole ligand whose cavity size can be tuned through peripheral modification of the steric bulk of the imidazole substituents. Conformational dynamics and redox potentials of the complexes are dependent on ligand steric bulk. Stability constants are consistent with the hypothesis that larger ligand cavities are relatively favorable for Mn2+ over Zn2+, but this effect alone may not be sufficient to achieve Mn2+ selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A pH&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Actuated Molecular Shuttle in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of the Viologen&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Imidazole (VPI) guest, previously shown to be bound by cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with binding modes depending on pH and silver ions, has been extended by adding hydrophobic groups on the two extremities of VPI before investigations of CB[7] binding by NMR, ITC, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. With an imidazole station extended by a naphthalene group (VPI&#8208;N), binding modes of CB[7] are similar to those previously observed. However, with the viologen extended by a tolyl group (T&#8208;VPI), CB[7] preferentially sits on station T, shuttling between the T and P stations at acid pH or after Ag+ addition. The CB[7]&#8226;T&#8208;VPI complex thus behaves as a metal&#8208;actuated thermodynamic stop&#8208;and&#8208;go molecular shuttle featured by fast and autonomous ring translocation between two stations and a continuum for fractional station occupancy solely and easily controlled by Ag+ concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>UV&#8208;blocking and light&#8208;responsive poly (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) /ZIF&#8208;8 multifunctional composite films for efficient antibacterial activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has received considerable attention owing to its superiority. ZIF&#8208;8 was used to address the poor stability of the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB) encapsulation to synthesize RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, which were doped into a composite film with poly (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;quaternary ammonium chitosan (PVA&#8208;QCS) as substrates to form composite films (PQZ). The composite films exhibited excellent photodynamic sterilization and good resistance to bacterial adhesion. The tensile strength of the film increased to 43.4 MPa, which was approximately 1.8 times that of the PCL film. With the addition of SiO2 and RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, the film exhibited water repellency and UV&#8208;blocking properties. RAW264.7 cells were selected using the MTT method to confirm that the composite film had excellent biocompatibility and had no significant inhibitory effect on cell growth and reproduction. PQZ multifunctional composite films show potential as novel APDT antimicrobial materials for food packaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Defluorination of fluorophenols by a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species: observation of a new intermediate along the reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are versatile oxidants in the biotransformation of various substrates by metalloenzymes and catalyze essential reactions for human health but also in the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants in the environment. Herein, we report a biomimetic system that efficiently reacts with fluorophenols through defluorination reactions and trap and characterize various short&#8208;lived intermediates along the reaction mechanism. We present the synthesis and characterization of a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species and study its reactivity patterns with a series of trihalophenols (X = F, Cl, Br). A combined experimental and computational study reveals that the oxidative dehalogenation of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenol is initiated with an H&#8208;atom abstraction from the phenolic group by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species resulting in the formation of a phenolate radical and an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species. This iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species forms an adduct with the oxidized substrate with lmax at 558 nm which subsequently decays to give quinones as products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical C&#8208;N Coupling of Amides with (Hetero)aryl  Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports a photochemical C&#8208;N coupling of abundant, but less reactive aryl chlorides, with structurally diverse primary and secondary amides by Ni&#8208;mediated without an external photocatalyst. Under the irradiation of light (390&#8208;395 nm) with a soluble organic amine as the base, the reaction allows for the successful transformation of (hetero)aryl chlorides to a wide range of N&#8208;aryl amides. More than 60 examples are shown, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of this protocol in organic synthesis. Mechanic studies indicate that this amidation proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(III) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>The Impact of the Solvent Dielectric Constant on A&#8592; NH3 Dative Bond Depends on the Nature of the Lewis Electron&#8208;Pair Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work aims to determine to what extent the value of the dielectric constant of the solvent can influence the dative bond in Lewis electron pair bonding systems. For this purpose, two different systems, namely H3B&#172;NH3 and {Zn&#172;(NH3)}2+, were studied in selected solvents with significantly different dielectric constants. Based on the results resulting from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods using DFT, constrained DFT, energy decomposition analyses, solvent accessible surface area, and charge transfer calculations, we found that the stability of the neutral H3B&#172;NH3 system increases with increasing solvent polarity. In contrast, the opposite trend is observed for the positively charged {Zn&#172;(NH3)}2+. The observed changes are attributed to different charge redistributions in neutral and charged complexes, which are reflected by a different response to the solvent and are quantified by changes in solvation energies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Common C2&#8208;Symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Biphenol Building Block and its Application in the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;Gonytolide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of biaryl polyketides exhibit remarkable bioactivities. However, their synthetic accessibility is often challenging. Herein, the enantioselective preparation and synthetic application of an axially chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol building block is outlined that represents a common motif of these intriguing natural products. Based on the highly regioselective and scalable bromination of a phenol precursor, a coupling process by Lipshutz cuprate oxidation was developed. A copper&#8208;mediated deracemization strategy proved to be superior to derivatization or kinetic resolution approaches. Key steps in the overall building block synthesis were rationalized through DFT&#8208;studies. Utilizing the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol, a highly diastereoselective five step synthesis of formerly unknown (+)&#8209;di&#8208;epi&#8208;gonytolide A was developed, thus showcasing the building block&#8217;s general potential for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. En route, the first enantioselective construction of a chromone dimer intermediate was established.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization of Triphenylamine bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we probe the hydrogen bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a triphenylamine (TPA) bis&#8208;urea macrocycle in the presence and absence of guests. Comprised of methylene urea&#8208;bridged TPAs with exterior tridodecyloxy benzene solubilizing groups, the macrocycle exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent aggregate formation in THF and H2O/THF mixtures as characterized by&#160;1H NMR and DOSY experiments. Its assembly processes were further probed by temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon heating, UV/Vis spectra exhibit a hypsochromic shift in the&#160;&#955;max, while fluorescence spectra show an increase in emission intensity. Conversely, the protected macrocycle that lacks hydrogen bond donors demonstrates no significant change. Thermodynamic analysis indicates a cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathway with distinct nucleation and elongation regimes. The morphology and structure of the aggregate were elucidated by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Variable temperature emission spectra were utilized to monitor the impact of guests, such as diphenylacetylene, that can be bound in the columnar channels. The findings suggest that the elongation of assemblies is influenced by the presence of these guests. In comparison, diphenyl sulfoxide, likely functioning as a chain stopper, limited the assembly size.&#160;&#160;These studies suggest that judicious selection of (co)monomers may modulate the function and utility of these supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Shape of Short Metal&#8208;Mediated Heteroleptic Tapes of Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In view of developing artificial light&#8208;responsive complex systems, the preparation of discrete and robust heteroleptic assemblies of different chromophores in precisely defined positions is of great value since they would allow to investigate directional processes unavailable in symmetrical architectures. Here we describe the preparation, through a modular stepwise approach, and characterization of four novel and robust metal&#8208;mediated heteroleptic 4+3 porphyrin tapes, labeled D4&#8208;T4&#8208;D4, D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3, D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4 , and D3&#8208;T3&#8208;D3, where a central meso&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (either 3'&#8208;TPyP = T3or 4'&#8208;TPyP = T4) is connected to two equal cis&#8208;dipyridylporphyrins (either 3&#8242;cisDPyMP = D3 or 4&#8242;cisDPyMP = D4) through four {t,c,c&#8208;RuCl2(CO)2} fragments. Whereas D4&#8208;T4&#8208;D4 is flat, the tapes containing at least one 3&#8242;PyP, i.e. D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3, D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4, and D3&#8208;T3&#8208;D3, have unprecedented &#8211; and well defined &#8211; 3D geometries, and each exists in solution as a pair of stereoisomers in slow conformational equilibrium. The X&#8208;ray molecular structures of two such conformers, the C&#8208;shaped (D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3)C and the z&#8208;shaped (D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4)z, were determined and are fully consistent with the solution NMR findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;Aryldihydroquinolines using Lithiation &#8211; Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Dihydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly enantiomerically enriched dihydrohydroquinolines were prepared in two steps from quinoline. Addition of aryllithiums to quinoline with tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection gave N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. These were treated with n&#8208;butyllithium and electrophilic trapping occurred exclusively at C&#8208;4 of the dihydroquinoline, a result supported by DFT studies. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy gave kinetic data for the barrier to rotation of the carbonyl group (&#916;G&#8225;&#160;~&#160;49 kJ mol&#8211;1, 195 K). Lithiation using the diamine sparteine allowed kinetic resolutions with high enantioselectivities (enantiomer ratio up to 99:1). The enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines could be converted to 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines with retention of stereochemistry. Further functionalisation led to trisubstituted products. Reduction provided enantioenriched tetrahydroquinolines, whereas acid&#8208;promoted removal of Boc led to quinolines, and this was applied to a synthesis of the antimalarial compound M5717.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Solution History to Control Hydrogel Properties of a Perylene Bisimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: pH dependence on water soluble aggregates is well&#8208;known in the field of low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs), with different aggregates sometimes having very different properties depending on their final pH. This aggregation determines their applications and performance. Here, we investigate the pH dependence of perylene bisimide gels; initially solutions are formed at a high pH and gels form as the pH is decreased. We find it is not only the final pH but also the starting pH that can impact the resulting gel. We use small angle neutron scattering (SANS), rheology, 1H NMR spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy to examine the effect of starting pH on gelation kinetics and final gel properties. Adjusting the solution from pH 9 (where there are few or no aggregates) to pH 6 results in the formation of different worm&#8208;like micelles than the ones directly formed at pH 6, leading to again gels with different mechanical properties. This work highlights the importance of controlling the pH of solutions before gelation, but also opens up more possible morphologies and therefore more properties from the same molecule.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and catalyst&#8208;free sunlight induced protocol for the remote meta&#160;bromination of electron&#8208;deficient indoles is described for the first time. Herein, N&#8208;bromosaccharin is activated by sunlight irradiation. Alternately, a synergistic activation model (Sc(OTf)3/HFIP) has also been developed for the activation of haloniums, complementary to the light induced strategy. In addition, the cascade C6&#8722;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed. High regio&#8208;and chem&#8208;selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and scalability demonstrate great potential of the developed methods in practical applications and further functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detector of Two&#8208;Dimensional Multilayer Hybrid Perovskite Crystals Showing High Polarization Ratio to Weak Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskite materials have been widely used for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection due to their fascinating optical and physical attributes. However, studies on those materials that enable strong polarized&#8208;light activities under a weak&#8208;light condition remain quite scarce. Here, by tailoring aromatic cation into 3D prototype, we have successfully obtained a new 2D hybrid perovskite, (FPEA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 (1, where FPEA is 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium and MA is methylammonium). The alternative alignment of inorganic and organic structural components results in significant anisotropy, including optical absorption and electric conductivity. The coupling effect of these anisotropic properties in 1 gives rise to strong dichroic activities toward detecting polarized light. Especially, under weak light intensity (~330 nW/cm2), it can still generate a large polarization ratio up to 1.35, which is even higher than those of some typical 2D materials (i.e., GeSe ~ 1.09). Besides, single crystal&#8208;based photodetector of 1 displays fascinating detecting performances, including large photocurrent on/off ratio (~ 104), fast response time (~ 154/182 &#956;s) and excellent antifatigued stability. These findings disclose the potentials of 1 as a robust candidate for detecting weak polarized light, which has practical applications in the field of polarized optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two novel nona coordinated Eu(III) complexes [Eu(btfa)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;1) and [Eu(NTA)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;2) &#160;have been synthesized and characterized. The structure of the complexes was elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) methods. The experimental photophysical properties of the complexes were investigated and complemented with theoretical calculations. Effective energy transfer (ET) pathways for the sensitized red luminescence is discussed. The complexes were tested as emitting layers (EML) in OLEDs. At the optimum doping concentration of 4 wt%, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;1 exhibited red electroluminescence (EL) with an EQE of 4.0% and maximum brightness (B) = 1179 cd/m2, maximum current efficiency (&#951;c) = 5.64 cd/A, maximum power efficiency (&#951;p) = 4.78 lm/W with very low turn&#8208;on voltage (Vturn&#8208;on) = 3.6 V at the current density (J) of 10 mA/cm2. Interestingly, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;2 at the optimum concentration of 3 wt%, displayed an outstanding EL performance with EQE of 7.32% and B = 838 cd/m2, &#951;c = 10.19 cd/A, &#951;p = 10.33 lm/W, and Vturn&#8208;on = 3.1 V at J =10 mA/cm2. The EL performance of this device is among the best reported for devices incorporating a europium complex as a red emitter.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;rich MoIV3&#8208;Polyoxomolybdates Resembling the Paratungstic Archetype</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first polyoxometalates (POMs) composed of MoIV, MoV2, discrete d1&#8208;MoV and MoVI, [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956; 2 &#8208;OH)(&#956; 3 &#8208;OH)py9] (1), was prepared from the solvothermal partial oxidation of [MoIV3O2(O2CCH3)6(H2O)3]ZnCl4 in a mixture of pyridine and water. The MoV=O adduct&#8208;free unit [H2Mo12O33py9] presents the 11e&#8208;reduced Mo derivative of the paratungtic archetype. The use of methanol, ethanol, n&#8208;propyl alcohol and triglycol instead of water produced the isostructural [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(&#956;2&#8208;OR)py9]( R = CH3, 2; C2H5, 3; C3H7, 4; C2H4OH, 5), providing the first examples of MoIV3&#8208;POMs containing bridging alkoxyl groups. The addition of [CrIIIMo6O24]9&#8208; led to the substitution of {MoV=O}3+ with {CrIII&#8208;py}3+ in the allomer [MoIV3MoV5MoVI4CrIIIO32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py10] (6). Using a mixture of Mo3 and MoW2 precursors afforded WVI&#8208;incorporated allomer [MoIV3MoV6MoVIWVI3O32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py9] (7). The complete substitution of MoVI with WVI by using a mixture of the Mo2W, MoW2 and W3 precursors produced the diamagnetic [MoIV3MoV6WVI4O33(&#956;3&#8208;OH)py9]&#8208; (syn&#8208;8) resulting from the anti&#8594;syn conversion between the top and bottom M3 triads concomitant with MoV&#8208;MoV bonding. Both anti&#8208;1&#8208;7 and syn&#8208;8 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analyses. The spin distribution and magnetic interactions have been investigated by temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility and DFT theoretical calculations.

         <title>Cs2AgBiCl6: a novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst for degradation of organic dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decades, great efforts have been made to develop novel visible&#8208;light photocatalysts to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency by utilizing visible light, the largest proportion of solar energy. As a new type of photocatalyst materials, all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites have begun to attract widespread interest. Herein, double perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 was developed into a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst for degrading organic dyes. Cs2AgBiCl6 was prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation and anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization methods, respectively, and was used to degrade organic dyes under visible light. Samples prepared by the anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization method are smaller than those prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation method, which can degrade 95.7% of Sudan III in 10 min and show excellent photocatalytic activity. The cyclic experiments demonstrate that Cs2AgBiCl6 has a good cycle stability. Moreover, Cs2AgBiCl6&#8208;AS also exhibits good photocatalytic degradation ability for Methyl red and Malachite green. These distinctive results indicate that Cs2AgBiCl6 may be a promising material for developing novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5&#8197;years that have relied on such intermediates to facilitate new reactivity or generate novel fragments. This review explores the broad range of chemical transformations that have utilized metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as linchpin reagents from their first reported use in synthesis to the present day.







Abstract
The use of metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in synthesis is currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5&#8197;years that have relied on such intermediates to undergo unique transformations or generate novel fragments. Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C&#8722;H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Understanding Off&#8208;Cycle and Deactivation Pathways in Radical&#8208;Type Carbene Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis is an efficient method for C&#8722;C coupling reactions, but also suffers from off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways, such as hydrogen atom transfer and the formation of N&#8208;enolate and bridging carbenes. In this concept article, we demonstrate that off&#8208;cycle species not always lead to a dead&#8208;end and can even unlock new reactivity.







Abstract
Transition metal radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis is a sustainable and atom&#8208;efficient method to generate C&#8722;C bonds, especially to produce fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A significant amount of research has therefore been devoted to applying this methodology, which resulted in innovative routes toward otherwise synthetically challenging products and a detailed mechanistic understanding of the catalytic systems. Furthermore, combined experimental and theoretical efforts elucidated the reactivity of carbene radical complexes and their off&#8208;cycle pathways. The latter can imply the formation of N&#8208;enolate and bridging carbenes, and undesired hydrogen atom transfer by the carbene radical species from the reaction medium which can lead to catalyst deactivation. In this concept paper, we demonstrate that understanding off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways not only affords solutions to circumvent them, but can also uncover novel reactivity for new applications. In particular, considering off&#8208;cycle species involved in metalloradical catalysis can stimulate further development of radical&#8208;type carbene transfer reactions.

Abstract
Our recent publication in Chem. Eur. J. 2022, 28, e202104341 has inspired Prof. Peter&#8197;B. Crowley (P.C.) to write a Correspondence questioning the presented concept of electrostatic self&#8208;assembly. The offered criticism is twofold: 1) the role of the cationic pillar[5]arene macrocycle to act as molecular glue in the formation of electrostatically driven protein assemblies is questioned by arguing that the pillararene is not incorporated into the frameworks. 2) Later, P.C. speculates that when the frameworks form, the role of electrostatic interactions is not firmly established and cation&#8208;pi bonding is the more plausible interaction. In this response, the raised comments are addressed. We present direct experimental NMR evidence showing that the pillar[5]arene is incorporated into the frameworks. Furthermore, we discuss the electrostatic self&#8208;assembly and our ferritin&#8208;related research line more broadly and clarify the role of key experiments.

         <title>Flow Synthesis of Gigantic Porphyrinic Cages: Facile Synthesis of P12L24 and Discovery of Kinetic Product P9L18</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a continuous flow methodology for the facile and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of the porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled organic cage, P12L24, along with the serendipitous discovery of a kinetic product, P9L18 cage, which has been characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, NMR, and AFM analysis. A theoretical study suggests a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry for P9L18. Unlike P12L24, P9L18 is unstable and readily decomposes into monomers and small oligomers. While the batch synthesis produces only the thermodynamic product P12L24, the continuous flow process generates not only the thermodynamic product but also kinetic products, such as P9L18, illustrating the advantages of the continuous flow process for the synthesis of self&#8208;assembled cages and the exploration of new non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoiridium Complexes Enhance Cellular Defense Against Reactive Aldehydes Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although reactive aldehyde species (RASP) are associated with the pathogenesis of many major diseases, there are currently no clinically approved treatments for RASP overload. Conventional aldehyde detox agents are stoichiometric reactants that get consumed upon reacting with their biological targets, which limits their therapeutic efficiency. To achieve longer&#8208;lasting detoxification effects, small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts (SIMCats) were used to protect cells by converting RASP into non&#8208;toxic alcohols. It was shown that SIMCats were significantly more effective in lowering cell death from the treatment with 4&#8208;hydroxynon&#8208;2&#8208;enal than aldehyde scavengers over a 72 h period. Studies revealed that SIMCats reduced the aldehyde accumulation in cells exposed to the known RASP inducer arsenic trioxide. This work demonstrates that SIMCats offer unique benefits over stochiometric agents, potentially providing new ways to combat diseases with greater selectivity and efficiency than existing approaches.</dc:description>

It was shown that SIMCats were significantly more effective in lowering cell death from the treatment with 4-hydroxynon-2-enal than aldehyde scavengers over a 72 h period. Studies revealed that SIMCats reduced the aldehyde accumulation in cells exposed to the known RASP inducer arsenic trioxide. This work demonstrates that SIMCats offer unique benefits over stochiometric agents, potentially providing new ways to combat diseases with greater selectivity and efficiency than existing approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh catalyzed method for direct decarbonylative borylation of carboxylic acid has been developed. This protocol exhibits a wide scope, is scalable and successfully used to late&#8208;stage diversification of many carboxylic acid containing drugs. One&#8208;pot borylation/derivatization reaction was also achieved and may open the door to explore new transformation from carboxylic acid.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are abundant, low cost and environmentally friendly, direct convert carboxylic acids into valued&#8208;added compounds are in high demand. Herein, we report a Rh(I) catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl and alkyl carboxylic acid using TFFH as activator. This protocol features excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance and a broad substrate scope including natural product and drugs. A gram&#8208;scale decarbonylative borylation reaction of Probenecid is also presented. In addition, the utility of this strategy is highlighted by a one&#8208;pot decarbonylative borylation/ derivatization sequence.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Chemistry of Complex Alkaloids: Combining Targeted Molecular Networking Approach and Semisynthetic Strategy to Access Rare Communesins in a Marine&#8208;Derived Penicillium expansum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare heptacyclic alkaloids, namely communesins, could be specifically targeted on a molecular network and further obtained by semisynthesis. This work describes a comprehensive strategy to access unrevealed chemodiversity from fungi.







Abstract
Communesins are rare alkaloids isolated from fungi of the genus Penicillium. In this work, the extract of a marine&#8208;derived Penicillium expansum strain was studied using targeted molecular networking approach allowing to detect 65 communesins including 55 new ones. A fragmentation pattern for dimethylvinyl communesins was established and a script was implemented allowing to predict the structure and map all communesins in a global molecular network. A semisynthetic strategy was carried out to obtain some minor congeners from the two isolated communesins A and B. Nine communesins were then synthetised: two of them were already described as produced by the studied strain; four are new natural products which occurrence in the extracts was confirmed; three are new semi&#8208;synthetic analogues never described so far. These communesins were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on two human cancer cell lines KB and MCF&#8208;7 leading to a preliminary study of their structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Extending the Palette of Green Coumarin Photocages &#8211; Oligonucleotide Fragmentation and Superior 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the green&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing DCCM photocage was modified to not just allow oligonucleotide release (OFF&#8594;ON) but also oligonucleotide fragmentation and thereby serve an additional regulation pathway (ON&#8594;OFF) that gives more freedom in gene regulation. Furthermore, the uncaging efficiency of DCCM by rigidification of the coumarin core was improved, resulting in an additional 20&#8197;nm red&#8208;shift.







Abstract
The possibilities of dicyanocoumarin (DCCM)&#8208;modified oligonucleotides are expanded to not just allow their release and therefore activation with green light (OFF&#8594;ON) but to also now offer a solution for their fragmentation after exposure to green light (ON&#8594;OFF). Furthermore, an answer to the decreasing uncaging quantum yields often faced when working with red&#8208;shifted photocages is given and showed that rigidified DCCM 5&#8217;&#8208;caps outperform their predecessors. Those two new 5&#8217;&#8208;caps with ATTO 390 motif or julolidine core are compatible with copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloadditions (CuAACs) and therefore suitable for efficient caging through cyclization or more bioconjugation reactions. Due to their planarization, they even experience an additional red&#8208;shift which is important for their use in biological applications.

         <title>Stoichiometry&#8208;Directed Two&#8208;Level Hierarchical Growth of Lanthanide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface synthesis process of a metal&#8208;organic supramolecular structure based on hierarchical growth driven by Dy atoms is shown in this work. Modifying the stoichiometry, it is possible to tune the size of the tecton unit in a controlled manner.







Abstract
The design of a well&#8208;ordered arrangement of atoms on a solid surface has long been sought due to the envisioned applications in many different fields. On&#8208;surface synthesis of metal&#8208;organic networks is one of the most promising fabrication techniques. Hierarchical growth, which involves coordinative schemes with weaker interactions, favours the formation of extended areas with the desired complex structure. However, the control of such hierarchical growth is in its infancy, particularly for lanthanide&#8208;based architectures. Here the hierarchical growth of a Dy&#8208;based supramolecular nanoarchitecture on Au(111) is described. Such an assembly is based on a first hierarchical level of metallo&#8208;supramolecular motifs, which in a second level of hierarchy self&#8208;assemble through directional hydrogen bonds, giving rise to a periodic two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular porous network. Notably, the size of the metal&#8208;organic based tecton of the first level of hierarchy can be tailored by modifying the metal&#8208;ligand stoichiometric ratio.

         <title>Tuning the Photophysical Properties and Photostability of Bis(naphthobipyrrolylmethene) derived BODIPY via Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of NIR absorbing and emitting, naphthobipyrrole derived BODIPY dyes are reported. These dyes possess different functional groups viz. &#8208;CHO, &#8208;CN, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;Br and Ph at its &#945;,&#945;'&#8208;positions. All the derivatives were characterized thoroughly via various spectroscopic means as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses. Impacts of functionalization on its photophysical properties as well as photostability were evaluated. For instance, incorporation of the phenyl moieties at the &#945;, &#945;'&#8208;positions by Suzuki coupling of the dibromo&#8208;derivative 4 with phenyl boronic acid led to substantial bathochromic shift in absorption (762 vs 727 nm) and emission (778 vs 744 nm) relative to the unsubstituted parent dye VI. Theoretical calculations have been performed by ground state optimization to evaluate the electronic transitions which supports experimental observation.</dc:description>

         <title>A greener pathway to enantiopurity: mechanochemical deracemization through abrasive grinding.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first case of mechanochemical deracemization by using liquid&#8208;assisted abrasive grinding. The target molecule is a precursor of Paclobutrazol, an important fungicide and plant growth inhibitor. Using mechanochemical deracemization, we are even able to transform a 10% ee scalemic mixture of this latter in an enantioenriched product of 97% ee in a couple of hours. This is substantially shorter compared to solution&#8208;based deracemization methodologies.

The target molecule is a precursor of Paclobutrazol, an important fungicide and plant growth inhibitor. Using mechanochemical deracemization, we are even able to transform a 10% ee scalemic mixture of this latter in an enantioenriched product of 97% ee in a couple of hours. This is substantially shorter compared to solution-based deracemization methodologies. The present paper thus introduces an efficient and greener process to enantiopure material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A novel C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 ternary heterostructure nanoflower for hydrogen evolution reaction at wide pH range and efficient overall water splitting in alkaline media</title>

         <dc:description>The development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional catalysts is still a challenge for hydrogen production through overall water splitting. This paper reports the in&#8208;situ synthesis of C&#8208;doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 using bacterial cellulose (BC) as the reducing agent and the source of C and using BC (MoS2/Co1.2MoO4.2&#183;1.2H2O/BC) as the template. Heterogeneous structure for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alkaline water electrolysis in a wide pH range. Due to the large number of defect sites caused by C doping and the synergy between these three active components (MoS2, CoP and MoO2), the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the catalyst have been greatly improved. Therefore, during HER, a small initial overpotential (27 mV) was achieved in 1.0 M KOH. In 0.5 M H2SO4, 0.1 M PBS and 1.0 M KOH, the current density reached 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at overpotentials of 123.4, 150, and 139 mV, respectively. For OER, an overpotential of 268 mV was required to achieve 10 mA cm&#8208;2. The alkaline two&#8208;electrode device composed of C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 delivers 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at a low potential of 1.51 V and can be easily driven by a single AA battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of C(13)&#8208;Desmethylene&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;Zampanolide Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and biochemical and cellular profiling of five partially reduced or demethylated analogs of the marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (ZMP). These analogs were derived from 13&#8208;desmethylene&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;zampanolide (DM&#8208;ZMP), which is an equally potent cancer cell growth inhibitor as ZMP. Key steps in the synthesis of all compounds were the formation of the dioxabicyclo[15.3.1]heneicosane core by an intramolecular HWE reaction (67%&#8208;95% yield) and a stereoselective aza&#8208;aldol reaction with an (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived sorbamide transfer complex, to establish the C(20) stereocenter (24%&#8208;71% yield). As the sole exception, for the 5&#8208;desmethyl macrocycle, ring&#8208;closure relied on macrolactonization; however, elaboration of the macrocyclization product into the corresponding zampanolide analog was unsuccessful. Compared to DM&#8208;ZMP, all modifications led to reduced cellular activity and lowered microtubule&#8208;binding affinity, albeit to a different extent. For compounds incorporating the reactive enone moiety of ZMP, IC50's for cancer cell growth inhibition varied between 5 nM and 133 nM, compared to 1 nM to 12 nM for DM&#8208;ZMP. Reduction of the enone double bond led to a several hundred&#8208;fold loss in growth inhibition. The cellular potency of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;13&#8208;desmethylene zampanolide, as the most potent analog identified, remained within a 9&#8208;fold range of that of DM&#8208;ZMP.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibodies Directed Against GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyrosine Posttranslational Modifications &#8211; a New Tool for Glycoproteomic Detection</title>

Catch as catch can. Fmoc&#8208;SPPS &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr amino acid building blocks were prepared and applied in synthesis of glycopeptide vaccine constructs and an extensive Tyr&#8208;modified glycopeptide library. Antibodies were raised and affinity purified against the antigen peptides. Evaluation by ELISA, glycopeptide microarrays and by western blot analysis showed high antibody specificity towards GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications without cross reactivity to the corresponding Ser or Thr glycopeptides.







Abstract
In the last decade, it was discovered that protein mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and O&#8208;GlcNAcylation modify Tyr residues besides the well explored Thr and Ser amino acids. Several glycoproteomic studies have identified &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications, and studies propose that &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr also exists as a new group of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Specific bacterial toxins have further been identified to modify host GTPases with &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr to promote bacterial virulence. Despite being identified on numerous proteins, the biological roles, biosynthesis and expression of GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications are poorly understood. A major obstacle is the lack of tools to specifically detect and identify proteins containing these modifications. With this in mind, we prepared vaccine constructs and raised antibodies to enable selective detection of proteins carrying these new PTMs. The obtained polyclonal antibody sera were evaluated using ELISA and glycopeptide microarrays and were found to be highly selective for GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr glycopeptides over the corresponding Ser&#8208; and Thr&#8208;modifications. For microarray analysis, synthetic GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr Fmoc&#8208;amino acids were prepared and applied in Fmoc&#8208;SPPS to obtain an extensive O&#8208;glycopeptide library. After affinity purification, the antibodies were applied in western blot analysis and showed specific detection of &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modified RhoA GTPase.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis allows for a simple and benign reaction set&#8208;up using water as the solvent without the need for oxygen&#8208;removing protocols. Blue light (456&#8197;nm) is absorbed by the photocatalyst and allows the [2+2] photocycloaddition to occur between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes. The observed reactivity for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is completely turned on by the use of a micellar solution as opposed to organic solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. N&#230;sborg and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300627).

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycles with Triplet Carbenes by means of an Unexpected 1,2&#8208;Alkyl Radical Migration

A triplet carbene is involved in the C3&#8208;H functionalization of indole heterocycles. We herein describe a combined experimental and computational study on this reaction and unveil an unexpected 1,2&#8208;alkyl radical migration pathway.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization of indole heterocycles constitutes a key strategy to leverage the synthesis of endogenous signaling molecules such as tryptamine or tryptophol. Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with indole, which shows an unusual solvent dependency. While C2&#8208;functionalization occurs under protic conditions, the use of aprotic solvents leads to a complete reversal of selectivity and exclusive C3&#8208;functionalization occurs. To rationalize for this unexpected reactivity switch, we have conducted detailed theoretical and experimental studies, which suggest the participation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes initial C2&#8208;functionalization. A distinct cationic [1,2]&#8208;alkyl radical migration then leads to formation of C3&#8208;functionalized indole. We conclude with the application of this photocatalytic reaction to access oxidized tryptophol derivatives including gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The C&#8722;H functionalization of indole heterocycles constitutes a key strategy to leverage the synthesis of endogenous signaling molecules such as tryptamine or tryptophol. Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with indole, which shows an unusual solvent dependency. While C2-functionalization occurs under protic conditions, the use of aprotic solvents leads to a complete reversal of selectivity and exclusive C3-functionalization occurs. To rationalize for this unexpected reactivity switch, we have conducted detailed theoretical and experimental studies, which suggest the participation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes initial C2-functionalization. A distinct cationic [1,2]-alkyl radical migration then leads to formation of C3-functionalized indole. We conclude with the application of this photocatalytic reaction to access oxidized tryptophol derivatives including gram-scale synthesis and derivatization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sila[1]ruthenocenophanes: Long Sought&#8208;After Family Members</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes were developed into an important class of monomers with the Me2Si&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophane being the most applied member. Surprisingly, the strained ruthenocene analogues are unknown. We now solved this mystery and reveal why sila[1]ruthenocenophanes are so challenging to prepare.







Abstract
During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes have been developed into an important class of monomers with the resulting polymers being the subject of hundreds of publications. For unknown reasons, not a single example of a silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ruthenocenophane is described in the literature. We set out to address this mystery and could synthesize the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes. Their molecular structures as well as their heat release in the melt, render them as highly strained sandwich compounds that are polymerizable. Why did it take so long to prepare the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes? This question is addressed by a detailed analysis of the kinetics of the salt&#8208;metathesis approach, which reveals a striking difference between ferrocene and ruthenocene.

         <dc:description>
The aromatic (C&#8722;H) sulfenylation reaction with S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) can be Trp&#8208; or Tyr&#8208;selective under acidic conditions. The red chloride anion team kicks the Cys(Acm)(O) ball into the Trp goal, whereas the blue trimethylsilyl team kicks the ball into the Tyr goal. The proton scoreline in the stands supports both teams. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Otaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300799).

         <dc:description>A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF3&#8208;subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF3CHN2. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, high yields (up to 95%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples). Importantly, we preformed scaffold diversification of a panel of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive heterocycles to generate the corresponding pyrazoline derivatives with potential broad bioactivities for further development.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Observation for Dynamic Oscillation during the Self&#8208;Assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic oscillation implicated in structural heterogeneity during the self&#8208;assembly of amyloid peptide 1&#8208;42 (A&#946;42) may play a crucial role in eliciting cellular responses. We developed a real&#8208;time monitoring platform to observe an oscillatory non&#8208;equilibrium interaction that dominated the A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells during interplay with an oscillator (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Molecular dynamics studies indicated that the electrostatic and hydrophobic segments of LPS involved in the temporary heteromolecular association and slightly decelerated the intrinsic thermally&#8208;induced protein dynamics of A&#946;42. A bait&#8208;specific intervention strategy could temporarily slow down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42 to extend the lifetime of autonomous oscillation and augment the A&#946;42 clearance of neuronal cells. The lifetime increment of dynamic oscillation shows a bait concentration&#8208;dependent manner to reflect the non&#8208;equilibrium binding strength. This relationship may serve as a drug&#8208;screening predictor for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechano&#8208;response release of small molecules has received extensive attention in ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled drug release in recent years because it can achieve non&#8208;invasive, spatiotemporally controlled precise drug release. However, the vast majority of small molecules mechano&#8208;release reported so far are almost based on polymer systems, which suffer from complex preparations and single mechano&#8208;response. Here, an isoguanosine (isoG) visualized mechano&#8208;response supramolecular self&#8208;assembly (isoG&#8208;VMRSS) system was successfully constructed by a one&#8208;pot reaction. It is completely composed of small molecules, which allows for multiple mechano&#8208;response releases of isoG (at least 9 times) and ultimately has potential for application in US drug release. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach reveals the supramolecular network structure (formed by the joint action of related metal coordination bonds, boronate ester bonds and hydrogen bonds mediated by isoG) gradually formed inside the system is the underlying internal mechanism. Therefore, it provides a new and effective idea of small molecule release in the field of mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric fluorescence assay for pyrophosphate based on sulfur nanodots decorated metal organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective and sensitive detection of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) are of great significance both for clinical applications and fundamental research. In this work, a ratiometric fluorescent probe was developed by decorating a porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (PCN&#8208;224) with sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots). The red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 was significantly promoted (more than 6&#8208;fold) by S&#8208;dots through inhibiting molecular motion of porphyrin ligand, which also provided active sites for the detection of Cu2+ and PPi. Cu2+ could selectively quench the red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 through coordination with porphyrin ligand, and the competition reaction between PPi and Cu2+ resulted in the decomposing of coordination and recovery of red&#8208;fluorescence. The blue&#8208;fluorescence from S&#8208;dots was deemed as effective reference, which provided a built&#8208;in correction in complex environments. Based on these photophysical properties, a ratiometric fluorescence assay was developed for the quantitative detection of Cu2+ and PPi, with a limit of detection of 0.11 and 2.66 &#956;M, respectively. The accuracy and practical applications of assays were also demonstrated by detection in tap water and human serum samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrostability and Carbon Dioxide Capture of Boroxine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by One&#8208;Pot Oligoamine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing two birds with one stone. The representative of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs, COF&#8208;1, is modified with an oligoamine by one&#8208;pot condensation. The modification with the oligoamine not only boosts the water stability of COF&#8208;1, but also significantly increases its CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2 selectivity, especially in low pressure region. These advantages make the oligoamine&#8208;modified COF&#8208;1 suitable for capturing CO2 from humid flue gas.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water at the electron&#8208;deficient boron sites and even slightly humid air could destroy the integrity of their porous frameworks within hours. Such instability is a major limitation to the practical applications of boron&#8208;based COFs. Herein we report a significant enhancement of hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;1 as representative) by modification with an oligoamine (tetraethylenepentamine, TEPA), which leads to survival of the modified COF in water and long&#8208;time stability under humid atmosphere. Meanwhile, the TEPA modification also results in a considerable increase in CO2 adsorption capacity up to 13&#8197;times and a dramatic improvement in CO2/N2 selectivity in low pressure region, which make the modified COF suitable for capturing CO2 from flue gas. This work provides a facile, efficient, and scalable method to greatly improve hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs and reshape them into high&#8208;performance CO2 adsorbents.

         <title>Determinative Effect of Axial Linearity on Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Performance in Dinuclear Dysprosium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of axial linearity in two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes could be managed by adjusting the diamine substituent on the salen ligand, which directly determines the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) performance. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that collinear/parallel anisotropic axes of two DyIII ions can enable zero&#8208;dc&#8208;field quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) effect.







Abstract
Two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes based on salen ligands, namely, [Dy(L1)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(thf)]2 (1; H2L1=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)phenylenediamine) and [Dy2(L2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2]2 (2; H2L2=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)ethylenediamine) are reported. These two complexes have two short Dy&#8722;O(PhO) bonds that exhibit angles of &#8764;90&#176; for 1 and &#8764;143&#176; for 2, leading to clear slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2 and not for 1. Compound 2 has a near&#8208;identical core to the recently reported compound [Dy2(L3)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] (3; H2L3=N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzyl)amine). The only substantial difference is the relative angle of the two O(PhO)&#8722;Dy&#8722;O(PhO) vectors, which is collinear in 2 owing to inversion symmetry and &#8764;68&#176; in 3 due to a molecular C2 axis. It is shown that this subtle structural difference leads to large differences in the dipolar ground states, giving rise to open magnetic hysteresis for 3 and not for 2.

         <title>CryoEM Structure with ATP Synthase Enables Late&#8208;Stage Diversification of Cruentaren&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pattern for a new design: The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren&#8197;A bound to ATP synthase is reported; it facilitated the design of new inhibitors through semisynthetic modification. Cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives were developed, and a trans&#8208;alkene isomer was found to exhibit similar activity to cruentaren&#8197;A against three cancer cell lines as well as other analogues that still retained potent inhibitory activity.







Abstract
Cruentaren&#8197;A is a natural product that exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines, yet its binding site within ATP synthase remained unknown, thus limiting the development of improved analogues as anticancer agents. Herein, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren&#8197;A bound to ATP synthase, which allowed the design of new inhibitors through semisynthetic modification. Examples of cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives include a trans&#8208;alkene isomer, which was found to exhibit similar activity to cruentaren&#8197;A against three cancer cell lines as well as several other analogues that retained potent inhibitory activity. Together, these studies provide a foundation for the generation of cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.

         <title>Lower Energy Excitation of Water Soluble Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Mixed&#8208;Ligand Metallacrowns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The best of both worlds: Water solubility of Zn16Ln(pyzHA)16 (H2pyzHA: pyrazine hydroxamic acid) or lower energy excitation of Zn16Ln(quinoHA)16 (H2quinoHA: quinoxaline hydroxamic acid) metallacrowns (MCs)? No need to choose! In water soluble mixed&#8208;ligand Zn16Yb(pyzHA)x(quinoHA)16&#8211;x MCs characteristic emission of YbIII in the near&#8208;infrared range can be sensitized upon excitation up to 600&#8197;nm in the solid state or 500&#8197;nm in aqueous solution.







Abstract
By combining advantages of two series of lanthanide(III)/zinc(II) metallacrowns (MCs) assembled using pyrazine&#8208; (pyzHA2&#8722;) and quinoxaline&#8208; (quinoHA2&#8722;) hydroximate building blocks ligands, we created here water&#8208;soluble mixed&#8208;ligand MCs with extended absorption to the visible range. The YbIII analogue demonstrated improved photophysical properties in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range in cell culture media, facilitating its application for NIR optical imaging in living HeLa cells.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Bioorthogonal Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines</title>

Non&#8208;frontier molecular orbital interaction&#8208;controlled reactivity: The reactivity of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines in inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions is often described by using frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory. We show that FMO interactions play a minuscule role in the reactivity difference between commonly used scaffolds. Instead, Pauli repulsion is often the deciding factor.







Abstract
1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines are increasingly used as reactants in bioorthogonal chemistry due to their high reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with various dienophiles. Substituents in the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;positions of the tetrazine scaffold are known to have a significant impact on the rate of cycloadditions; this is commonly explained on the basis of frontier molecular orbital theory. In contrast, we show that reactivity differences between commonly used classes of tetrazines are not controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that mono&#8208;substituted tetrazines show high reactivity due to decreased Pauli repulsion, which leads to a more asynchronous approach associated with reduced distortion energy. This follows the recent Vermeeren&#8211;Hamlin&#8211;Bickelhaupt model of reactivity increase in asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. In addition, we reveal that ethylene is not a good model compound for other alkenes in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

&lt;p&gt;1,2,4,5-Tetrazines are increasingly used as reactants in bioorthogonal chemistry due to their high reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with various dienophiles. Substituents in the 3- and 6-positions of the tetrazine scaffold are known to have a significant impact on the rate of cycloadditions; this is commonly explained on the basis of frontier molecular orbital theory. In contrast, we show that reactivity differences between commonly used classes of tetrazines are not controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that mono-substituted tetrazines show high reactivity due to decreased Pauli repulsion, which leads to a more asynchronous approach associated with reduced distortion energy. This follows the recent Vermeeren&#8211;Hamlin&#8211;Bickelhaupt model of reactivity increase in asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

The one&#8208;pot protocol involving the in&#8197;situ generation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the nucleophilic substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromoketones with amines and the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketone intermediates was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of a diverse array of chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent results.







Abstract
A straightforward synthesis approach to chiral 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminoethanols via the one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation catalyzed by Ir catalyst was developed. This tandem process involves the in&#8197;situ generation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the nucleophilic substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromoketones with amines and the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketone intermediates to provide diverse enantiomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. The excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) with a wide substrate scope in this one&#8208;pot strategy were obtained.

         <title>Electrochemical Rearrangement for Remote Functionalizations of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes were realized utilizing commercially available organofluorine reagents through scission of C&#8722;H/C&#8722;Br bonds via 1,2&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;migration process, leading to di and mono&#8208;fluoroalkyl functionalized ketone compounds with good functional group tolerance. This transformation tolerates a diverse set of migrating groups, involving (hetero)arenes, olefins, and alkynes.







Abstract
An electrochemical strategy for the dual functionalizations of unactivated alkenes through an intramolecular migration process was realized in the absence of sacrificial chemical oxidants and noble&#8208;metal catalysts under mild reaction conditions. The electrochemistry enabled a (hetero)aryl migration while providing access to alkenyl/alkynyl&#8208;migration products. Thus, electricity was employed for the formation of functionalized fluoroalkyl radicals through activation of C&#8722;H/C&#8722;Br bonds from fluorinated esters. Thereby, we obtained a variety of di and mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl products with good functional group tolerance as well as chemo, and regioselectivities. Likewise, defluorinative allylation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl alkyl bromides proved viable. The reaction mechanism was established by experiments and computations.

         <title>Unveiling Photodegradation and Photosensitization Mechanisms of Unconjugated Pterins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the crucial role of unconjugated pterins in enzymatic processes and the photosensitization of singlet oxygen and other biomolecules, the mechanism underlying the photochemistry of these chromophores is still unclear. With the help of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we shed light into the very fast triplet&#8208;state population, their photodegradation pathways, and the photosensitization of biomolecules.







Abstract
Unconjugated pterins are ubiquitous molecules that participate in countless enzymatic processes and are potentially involved in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen, amino acids, and nucleotides. Following electronic excitation with UV&#8208;A light, some of these pterins degrade, producing hydrogen peroxide as the main side product. This process, which is known to take place in&#8197;vivo, contributes to oxidative stress and melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. In this work, we present for the first time mechanistic insight into the formation of transient triplet species that simultaneously trigger Type I and Type II photosensitizing processes and the initiation of degradation processes. Our calculations reveal that photodegradation of 6&#8208;biopterin, which accumulates in the skin of vitiligo patients, leads to 6&#8208;formylpterin through a retro&#8208;aldol reaction, and subsequently to 6&#8208;carboxypterin through a water&#8208;mediated aldehyde oxidation. Additionally, we show that the changes in the photosensitizing potential of these systems with pH come from the modulation of their excited&#8208;state redox potentials.

         <title>Latent Pronucleophiles in Lewis Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Allylation of Silyl Enol Ethers with Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis base catalyzed allylations of C&#8208;centered nucleophiles have been largely limited to the niche substrates with acidic C&#8208;H substituted for C&#8208;F bonds at the stabilized carbanionic carbon. Herein we report that the concept of latent pronucleophiles serves to overcome these limitations and allow for a variety of common stabilized C&#8208;nucleophiles, when they are introduced as the corresponding silylated compounds, to undergo enantioselective allylations using allylic fluorides. The reactions of silyl enol ethers afford the allylation products in good yields and with high degree of regio / stereoselectivity as well as diastereoselectivity when cyclic silyl enol ethers are used. Further examples of silylated stabilized carbon nucleophiles that undergo efficient allylation speak in favor of the general applicability of this concept to C&#8208;centered nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of an efficient process that produces bioactive medium&#8208;sized N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds from 2&#8208;substituted anilines using either iodosobenzene or (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene&#160;is reported. The tether between the sulfonamide and the aryl group can be varied to access dihydroacridine&#8208;, dibenzazepine&#8208;, or dibenzazocine scaffolds. While substitution on the aniline portion is limited to electron&#8208;neutral&#8208; or electron&#8208;poor groups, a broader range of functional groups are tolerated on the&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent and site selective C&#8208;NAr bond formation can be achieved.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;, Temperature&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly: Merocyanine Dimerization as a Showcase Example for Obtaining Reliable Thermodynamic Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mathematical models for the concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent analysis of self&#8208;assembly equilibria are derived for the most simple case of dimer formation, to highlight the assumptions these models and the thus determined thermodynamic parameters are based on. The three models were applied to UV/Vis absorption data for the dimerization of a highly dipolar merocyanine dye in 1,4&#8208;dioxane. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) dilution experiments were performed as an independent reference technique. While the concentration&#8208;dependent analysis is according to our studies the most reliable method, also the less time&#8208;consuming temperature&#8208;dependent evaluation can give accurate results in the present example, despite small thermochromic effects. In contrast, the strong negative solvatochromism of the merocyanine tampers with the results from the solvent&#8208;dependent evaluation. Even though the studies presented in this work are limited to the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium of a dipolar dye, the basic principles can be transferred to other chromophores and different self&#8208;assembly models, including those for supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>The interplay between different stimuli in a 4D printed photo&#8208;, thermal&#8208;, and water&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomer actuator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;stimuli responsivity in 3D&#8208;printed objects is receiving much attention. However, the simultaneous interplay between different environmental stimuli is largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate direct ink writing of an oligomeric ink containing an azobenzene photo&#8208;switch with an accessible hydrogen bond allowing triple responsivity to light, heat, and water. The resulting printed liquid crystal elastomer performs multiple actuations, the response depending on the environmental conditions. Films printed on a static substrate forming bilayers can rapidly change shape, bending almost 80 degrees if irradiated in air or undergoing a shrinkage of about 50% of its length when heated. The bilayer film assumes dramatically different shapes in water depending on combined environmental temperature and lighting conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Dissection of Epsin&#8208;1 N&#8208;Terminal Helical Peptide: The Role of Hydrophobic Residues in Modulating Membrane Curvature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The induction of local changes in membrane structure often plays a pivotal role for cellular life. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein to induce positive membrane curvature and its N&#8208;terminal segment (EpN18) plays a key role. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 for a better understanding of general curvature&#8208;modulating mechanisms and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane structure.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal structural alterations in cellular membranes are the hallmark of many vital processes. In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles formation. Its N&#8208;terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature&#8208;inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i)&#8197;enhancing membrane interactions, (ii)&#8197;helix structuring, (iii)&#8197;inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv)&#8197;loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was obtained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa&#8208;arginine cell&#8208;penetrating peptides into living cells.

A predictive DFT study of L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct, able to act as a masked Lewis superacid. It provides a novel strategy to use M&#8208;ORF/L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 couples to generate catalytically active M+ centers featuring weakly coordinating aluminate counter anion.







Abstract
A DFT study of several L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 1&#8208;SiPr2 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct. 1&#8208;SiPr2 was shown to act as a masked Lewis superacid able to release Al(ORF)3 under mild conditions. It could be used to abstract a ORF&#8722; ligand from (bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)2 (bipyMe2&#8201;:&#8201;6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl) and generate the nickel alkoxide complex [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(iPr2S)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 5. Ligand exchange of iPr2S by Ph3P yielded [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(PPh3)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 6.

         <title>CO&#8208;Preserving Photoinduced Transfer of Cymantrenyl Moiety: a Tandem Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;exchangable CO: When one observes that the reaction product contains the same quantity of CO ligands as the substrate, it is natural to suspect that they do not detach during the reaction. We present a reaction where this is not the case and highlight the role of cage effect in this conundrum.







Abstract
Cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (cymantrene) is known to undergo photochemical reactions by releasing one of its CO ligands. Here we present the first example of a photorearrangement of a cymantrenylmethyl fragment, where it retains all its three CO ligands. A tandem experimental and DFT (density functional theory)&#8208;based computational investigation allows us to explain this unexpected behavior: the rearrangement, indeed, begins with the release of one CO ligand, but cage effect of the solvent captures this CO molecule, allowing it to rapidly reattach once the rearrangement takes place.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcoming limitations: Deracemization represents an attractive strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. How to compensate for the decrease in entropy and prevent microreversibility pose two unavoidable challenges. In recent years, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven asymmetric photocatalysis has been recognized as a promising tool to overcome the limitations, given that a number of deracemization reactions have been established. This review summarizes and discusses these important achievements.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis has long been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. In addition to precise enantiocontrol, high&#8208;atom economy, which is crucial for practicality, has always been pursued by chemists in the development of methodologies. Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated to be a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success is its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents, thus undermining the original advantages. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single&#8208;electron transfer in photocatalysis.

         <title>Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based drug design process is used to build inhibitors for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cholesterol oxidase enzymes CYP125 and CYP142. Elaboration of initial fragment screen used an iterative approach combining high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures, biophysical characterization, and structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). The resulting compounds yielded potent micromolar cellular activity against clinically relevant drug resistant Mtb strains.







Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host&#8208;derived lipids such as cholesterol not only support Mtb growth, but are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure&#8208;guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in&#8208;cell activity against clinically relevant drug&#8208;resistant isolates were obtained. These will incite further development of much&#8208;needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb pathogenesis.

         <title>Vanadium Pentafulvene Complexes: Synthon for Unprecedented VanadoceneIII Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) is exchanged with pentafulvenes to yield the first vanadium complexes with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordinating pentafulvene. Consecutive reactivity studies concerning element&#8208;H activation and insertion reactions of multiple bond containing substrates produced rare examples of vandoceneIII phenolate, alcoholate, and amide complexes with certain structure elucidation by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) (1) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b) and benzofulvene complexes (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordination mode with a vanadiumIII center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6&#8208;dimethylpentafulvene, a C&#8722;H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring&#8208;substituted vanadoceneII 4. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadoceneIII compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E&#8722;H splitting of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadoceneIII phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V&#8722;Cexo bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4&#8208;chlorobenzonitril and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

         <title>Regulation of the Oxidase Mimetic Activity of Ceria Nanoparticles by Buffer Composition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes: The buffer compositions have different effects on the oxidase mimetic activity of ceria nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) are important typical nanozymes with multiple enzyme mimetic activities, which could facilitate the oxidation of organic dyes in acidic conditions, because of the oxidase mimetic activity. Usually, the regulation of oxidase mimetic activity is focused on the adjustment of the structure, morphology, composition, surface, and other factors of nanozymes. However, the influence of the surrounding environment is not considered, which is very important during the reaction process. In this work, the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs in buffer solutions including citric acid, acetic acid and glycine buffer solutions was investigated, with the results that carboxyl group in buffer solution could adsorb the CNPs on the surface to promote the oxidase mimetic activity. Due to the chelation with the cerium ion, the enhancement is more significant by molecules with polycarboxylic groups, and the enhancement is more efficient by carboxyl molecules in buffer solution, compared with the modification of the carboxyl groups on the surface, because of easier operation and smaller steric hindrance. From the viewpoint of increasing the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs, the work is expected to provide references for the selection of the reaction systems to optimize the oxidase mimetic activity in bio&#8208;detection applications.

         <title>Insight of Cd2+ removal by MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown great potential as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. Nevertheless, howthe host&#8208;guest interactions of LDHs affect the removal mechanism remains to be less explored. Herein, we fabricated CO32&#8208;/NO3&#8208;/SO42&#8208;/Cl&#8208; intercalated MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions and investigated their removal mechanism for Cd2+. The removal capacity increased in the order of MgAl&#8208;CO3 (127.3 mg/g) &lt; MgAl&#8208;SO4 (173.3 mg/g) &lt; MgAl&#8208;NO3 (305.0 mg/g) &#8776; MgAl&#8208;Cl (312.5 mg/g). The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ XRD and XAS demonstrated that Cd2+ was removed in the form of CdCO3 for MgAl&#8208;CO3, while for MgAl&#8208;Cl/NO3/SO4, Cd2+ was all removed in the form of CdAl&#8208;LDHs with isomorphic substitution mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that the lower Gibbs free energy in the formation of CdCO3 than CdAl&#8208;LDHs made it easier to remove Cd2+ by CdCO3 on MgAl&#8208;CO3. Conversely, isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8208;NO3 to CdAl&#8208;LDHs was a free energy reduction process.</dc:description>

The quasi-in-situ XRD and XAS demonstrated that Cd2+ was removed in the form of CdCO3 for MgAl-CO3, while for MgAl-Cl/NO3/SO4, Cd2+ was all removed in the form of CdAl-LDHs with isomorphic substitution mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that the lower Gibbs free energy in the formation of CdCO3 than CdAl-LDHs made it easier to remove Cd2+ by CdCO3 on MgAl-CO3. Conversely, isomorphic substitution of MgAl-NO3 to CdAl-LDHs was a free energy reduction process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine ligated by an acridane derived NNN pincer ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The steric tuning of a tridentate acridane&#8208;derived NNN pincer ligand allows for the isolation of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine that exhibits ambiphilic reactivity. Well&#8208;defined phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is reported, contrasting with prior reports on this class of compounds. Reactions towards oxidants are also described. The latter result in the two&#8208;electron oxidation of the phosphorus atom from +III to +V, and are accompanied by a strong geometric distortion of the NNN pincer ligand. By contrast, cooperative activation of E&#8211;H (HCl, HBcat, HOMe) bonds proceeds with retention of the phosphorus redox state. When using H2O as a substrate, the reaction results in the full disassembly of H2O to its constituent atoms, highlighting the potential of this platform for small molecule activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of alkenes with acylhydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acylsilanes are an important class of organosilicon compounds that have gained increased attention recently. Their various reaction modes in particularly their ability to generate carbenes under thermal or photochemical conditions render them valuable reagents in organic synthesis. In this communication, an unprecedented route towards acylsilanes is reported by introducing the acylsilane moiety directly in a single step through alkene hydrosilylation. In this context, acylhydrosilanes representing a novel class of acylsilanes are introduced and applied as silylation reagents in rhodium catalyzed alkene hydrosilylations to access a great variety of acylsilanes. These reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance and atom economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Nickel Cobalt Phosphide Nanocrosses with Well&#8208;Defined Axial Arms for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concave nanostructure with highly branched architecture and abundant step atoms is one kind of desirable materials for energy conversion devices. However, current synthetic strategies for non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based NiCoP concave nanostructure still remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a site&#8208;selective chemical etching and subsequent phosphorating strategy to fabricate highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses (HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs). The HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs are consisted of six axial arms in three&#8208;dimensional space and each protruding arm is equipped with high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks. As an electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction, the HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs exhibit remarkably enhanced activity and stability, with small overpotential of 289 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2, surpassing the NiCoP nanocages and commercial RuO2. The superior OER performance of HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs is originated from the highly branched concave structure, the synergistic effect between bimetal Ni and Co atoms, as well as the electronic structure modulation from P.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning the Properties of Stapled Peptides by Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids were used as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs library of an IL&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the staples chirality (L/D) impacts on the peptide&#8216;s properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and binding affinity of the modified peptide compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges.







Abstract
Peptide stapling represents a versatile strategy to generate peptide derivatives with stable helical structures. While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated &#945;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs of an interleukin&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the interleukin&#8208;17A(IL&#8208;17A)&#8208;binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (L/D) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL&#8208;17A&#8208;inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of Enantioenriched Epoxides and Triols from Biomass&#8208;Derived Synthons Driven by Specifically Designed Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the design and application of multi&#8208;step enzymatic cascades to synthesize enantioenriched epoxides and vicinal aromatic triols from simple biomass&#8208;derived starting materials in one pot. These artificial metabolic pathways involve a tailor&#8208;made aldolase, a highly evolved cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme, and when needed a specifically chosen epoxide hydrolase. These attractive biocatalytic cascades can be performed under environmentally benign conditions, such as the use of aqueous media and mild temperatures, and do not require the isolation of reaction intermediates. Good to excellent conversions, high enantioselectivity, and moderate to good product yields are achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor&#8208;made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an effective aldolase with 160&#8208;fold increased activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4&#8208;OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4&#8208;OT mutant, in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) from biomass&#8208;derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68&#8201;% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three&#8208;step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3&#8208;prim,sec,sec&#8208;triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor&#8208;less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass&#8208;based synthons.

         <dc:description>Although Metal oxide ZnO is widely used as electron transport layers in all&#8208;inorganic PSCs due to high electron mobility, high transmittance, and simple preparation processing, the surface defects of ZnO suppress the quality of perovskite film and inhibit the solar cells&#8217; performance. In this work, [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PCBA) modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) is employed as electron transport layer&#160;in perovskite solar cells.&#160;The resulting perovskite film coated on the zinc oxide nanorods has better crystallinity and uniformity, facilitating charge carrier transportation, reducing recombination losses, and ultimately improving the cells&#8217; performance. The perovskite solar cell with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO nanorods/PCBA/CsPbIBr2/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au delivers a high short circuit current density of 11.83 mA cm&#8208;2 and power conversion efficiency of 12.05 %.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides as a novel tool for conformational modification in peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of 15 cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine and 10 cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides containing one or two backbone N&#8208;aryl amide bonds were synthesized by following a combination of solution phase and solid phase peptide synthesis. NMR based conformational studies of these N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine peptides have revealed five distinct template conformations with antiparallel beta sheet structure, and that of N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides have revealed three template structures. All the template structures have distinct peptide turn features. The conformations in theseN&#8208;aryl peptides were compared to those in the commonly studied N&#8208;methyl peptide analogs. We observed that the N&#8208;aryl peptides have exhibited a considerable conformational homogeneity, and their conformations have significantly differed from those in N&#8208;methyl analogs. We anticipate that the N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides has the potential for its application as a novel tool for conformational and physicochemical modification in peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide&#8208;Substituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Salts as Useful Synthetic Synthons: Access to Triazenyl Radicals and Staudinger type Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic carbenes (MIC) are a popular class of compound that are heavily investigated at the moment. The access to cationic MICs, and the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals are two highly attractive fields that have hardly been explored until now. Here we report the synthesis and characterisation of three different cationic azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts, used as building blocks for the study of their reactivity towards triphenylphosphine, where the reactivity is dependent on the nature of the starting triazolium salt. Furthermore, we have used the cationic triazolium salts to develop a series of unsymmetrical MIC&#8208;triazene&#8208;NHC/MIC&#8217; compounds, which can be readily converted to the radical form either via electrochemical or chemical methods. These radicals, which display NIR electrochromism, were investigated using a battery of techniques such as electrochemistry, UV/Vis/NIR and, EPR spectroelectrochemistry and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the MIC plays an important role in the stabilization of the triazenyl radical, particularly in a competitive role vis a vis their NHC counterparts. These results shed new light into the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals, and possibly also on their &#960;&#8208;accepting ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Solution and Solid&#8208;state Emitters &#8211; Robust Imaging Agents for Cells, Bacteria and Protists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of eight different cationic emitters with emission properties in solution and in solid&#8208;state (solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; SSSE) is presented. These compounds, bearing either ammonium or pyridinium groups, have been investigated regarding their photophysical properties as well as their potential application in biological imaging. Besides high quantum yields as well as a high degree of stability during the imaging process, it was additionally revealed that a broad range of biological targets can be addressed, such as different bacterial strains, human cells as well as protists. The reported SSSE approach employing the mentioned robust emitters for biological imaging, will contribute to a rapid and facile way to design and apply affordable emitters with outstanding properties. Additionally, these emitters will overcome the drawbacks of classical luminophores and agents featuring well&#8208;known aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Metalated Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azomethineylide [3+2] cycloadditions are a promising strategy for the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidines. In this Review, recent developments in the enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide by metal catalysis are summarized.







Abstract
Asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition reactions are fascinating and powerful methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolidines up to four stereocentres. Pyrrolidines are important compounds for both biology and organocatalytic applications. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of pyrrolidines by [3+2] cycloadditions of azomethine ylides using metal catalysis. It has been organized by the type of metal catalysis used and further arranged by the complexity nature of dipolarophile. The presentation of each reaction type highlights their advantages and limitations.

         <title>Small Molecule Activation on a Base&#8208;stabilized Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene towards N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and H&#8722;E (E=Si, P, B) bonds was studied. Reactions of the P(I) species with unsaturated compounds, such as tetrachlorobenzaquinone, benzaldehyde and phenylisocyanate, was also investigated.







Abstract
Reduction of (NP)PCl2 (NP=phosphinoamidinate [PhC(NAr)(=NPPri2)]&#8722;) with KC8 affords the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P (9). Reaction of 9 with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (MeC(NMe))2C: results in the NHC&#8208;adduct NHC&#8594;P&#8722;P(Pri2)=NC(Ph)=NAr featuring an iminophosphinyl group. Reactions of 9 with HBpin and H3SiPh led to the metathesis products (NP)Bpin and (NP)SiH2Ph, respectively, whereas with HPPh2 a base&#8208;stabilized phosphido&#8208;phosphinidene, the product of N&#8722;P and H&#8722;P bond metathesis, was obtained. Reaction of 9 with tetrachlorobenzaquinone results in oxidation of P(I) to P(III), accompanied by oxidation of the amidophosphine ligand into P(V). Addition of benzaldehyde to 9 results in a phospha&#8208;Wittig reaction affording a product of P=P and C=O bond metathesis. Related reaction with phenylisocyanate results in a product of N&#8722;P(=O)Pri2 addition to the C=N bond of an intermediate iminophosphaalkene to produce a phosphinidene intramolecularly stabilized by a diaminocarbene.

         <title>Efficient K&#8208;Storage of Fe&#8208;Coupled Organic Molecule Anode in Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal coupling strategy combined with electrolytes regulation are adopted to develop a novel organic K&#8208;storage anode of Fe&#8208;NTCDA with improved specific capacity and long cycle stability in the optimized 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes, attributed to the increased K&#8208;storage sites as well as enhanced K+ transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Given these advantages of widely designable structures and environmentally friendly characteristics, organic electrode materials (OEMs) are considered to be promising electrode materials for alkaline metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, their large&#8208;scale application is hampered by insufficient specific capacity and rate performance. Here, Fe2+ is coupled to the anhydride molecule NTCDA to form a novel K&#8208;storage anode Fe&#8208;NTCDA. In this way, the working potential of Fe&#8208;NTCDA anode is reduced, which makes it more suitable to be used as an anode material. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved due to the increase in K&#8208;storage sites. Moreover, electrolytes regulation is implemented to optimize the K&#8208;storage behavior, resulting into a high specific capacity of 167&#8197;mAh/g after 100 cycles at 50&#8197;mA/g and 114&#8197;mAh/g even at 500&#8197;mA/g in the 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes.

         <title>No Transition Metals Required &#8211; Oxygen Promoted Synthesis of Imines from Primary Alcohols and Amines under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal free: The synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohol and anilines promoted by oxygen and KOtBu at room temperature in the absence of a transition metal catalyst is described. The detailed investigation of the radical mechanism is presented revealing complex reaction paths and branching patterns.







Abstract
The synthesis of imines denotes a cornerstone in organic chemistry. The use of alcohols as renewable substituents for carbonyl&#8208;functionality represents an attractive opportunity. Consequently, carbonyl moieties can be in&#8197;situ generated from alcohols upon transition&#8208;metal catalysis under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, bases can be utilized under aerobic conditions. In this context, we report the synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohols and anilines, promoted by KOtBu under aerobic conditions at room temperature, in the absence of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst. A detailed investigation of the radical mechanism of the underlying reaction is presented. This reveals a complex reaction network fully supporting the experimental findings.

         <title>Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Based Cuboid Constructed by Chiral Self&#8208;Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuboid, a basic geometric structure, has been widely applied in architecture and mathematics. In chemistry, the introduction of cuboid structures always provides a specific structural shape, enhances the stability of the structure and improves the performance of materials. In this study, we propose a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;discrimination to construct a cuboid&#8208;stacking crystal material, in which a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) based on Tr&#246;ger's base (TB) and benzophenone (BP) was synthesized as the building element of the cuboid. The cuboid is designed to be transformable compared with cuboid structures in previous work. For this reason, it is considering that the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure can be transformed through external stimulation. Iodine vapor is selected as the external stimulus to transform the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure due to the favorable interaction between iodine and the cuboid. The changes in the stacking mode of TBBP is studied by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). To our surprise, this Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;based cuboid shows strong iodine adsorption capacity up to 3.43 g g&#8722;1 and exhibits potential as a crystal material for iodine adsorption.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing a straightforward and effective hydrophobic modification for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) under mild conditions is meaningful for MOF applications. Here, a post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8208;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid (TPA) is the essential force for the modifier TPA. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for efficient oil&#8208;water separation by coating TPA&#8208;modified UiO&#8208;66 (P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) on commercial melamine sponges (MS) and filter papers (FP). The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS composite could quickly and selectively absorb oily liquids up to 43 times its weight from water. P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/FP and P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS showed high separation efficiencies for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, respectively, with high resistance to low/high temperatures and acid/base conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,6/7&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208;Perylenediimide and 1,6/7&#8208;(NH2)2&#8208;Perylenediimide as Regioisomerically Pure Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of perylenediimide (PDI) building blocks in materials for organic electronic is of considerable interest. This popular n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is tuned by introducing peripheral groups in their ortho and bay positions. Such modifications radically alter their optoelectronic properties. In this article, we describe an efficient method to afford regioisomerically pure 1,6/7&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208; and (NH2)2&#8208;PDIs employing two key steps: the selective crystallization of 1,6&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxy tetrabutylester and the nitration of regiopure 1,7&#8208;Br2&#8208;PDI with silver nitrite. The optoelectronic properties of the resulting regioisomerically pure dinitro, diamino&#8208;PDIs and bisazacoronenediimides (BACDs) are reported and demonstrate the need to separate both regioisomers of such n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for their inclusion in advanced optoelectronic devices. For the first time, the two regioisomers of the same PDI starting material are available on the multigram scale, which will stimulate the exploration of regioisomerism/properties relationship for this family of dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>To Isomerize or not to Isomerize?
E  /Z&#160;Isomers of Cyclic Azobenzene Derivatives and their Reactivity upon One&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azo compounds are efficient electron acceptors. Upon one&#8208;electron reduction they generally isomerize forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. Here we show that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species. Markedly, diazonines, which bear a central nine membered heterocycle, show light induced&#160;E/Z&#160;isomerization, but retain the configuration of the diazene N=N moiety upon one&#8208;electron reduction. Accordingly,&#160;E/Z&#160;isomerization is not induced by reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Low Impact Acetalization Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of acetals in acidic Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) in which the solvent itself participates in the catalytic promotion of the reaction is herein reported. The reaction is performed under feasible conditions, open air, without the need of external additives, catalysts or water removing techniques and it is wide in scope. The products are easily recovered and the reaction medium is fully recycled and reused without weakening of its catalytic activity after 10 times. Remarkably, the entire process has been realized on gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Four New Sb&#8208;based Orthophosphates: Cation Regulation to Investigate Diversified Structural Architecture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the work, four new Sb&#8208;based phosphates, K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3, Rb(SbO2)2PO4, Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32, were successfully synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature melt method. Among them, Rb(SbO2)2PO4 and Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 are the first reported examples of Rb&#8208;containing alkali metal Sb&#8208;based phosphates. They show three&#8208;dimensional (3D) frameworks composed of [Sb8P4O30]&#8734; layer for K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3 and [Sb6P2O20]&#8734; layer for Rb(SbO2)2PO4, and 2D lamellar structure composed of [Sb3P2O10]&#8734; for Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32. A detailed structural comparison shows that the structure dimensions for them transfer from 1D to complex 3D framework with the increase of (Sb+P)/O ratio, which affects performances of the compounds. Optical property and energy band structure calculations were also carried out based on the density functional theory (DFT). The present study enriches the diversity of Sb&#8208;based phosphates and paves the way for further explore their optical properties in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bridge Controlled Patterning of BTR:PC71BM Bulk Heterojunction Micro Arrays towards High&#8208;performance Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The patterning strategy of organic semiconductors&#160;is&#160;a crucial&#160;issue for integrated circuit. However, due to the uncontrollable liquid dewetting, most of the research is mainly focused on the patterning of single component, few works have been done on the patterning of multi&#8208;component or heterojunction, which play an important role in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, a capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for patterning of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) micro&#8208;arrays, with liquid crystalline BTR and PC71BM utilized as donor and acceptor, respectively. The BTR:PC71BM arrays&#160;presented&#160;hierarchical morphology with suitable phase separation, which contributes to the efficient charge generation and transport. Moreover, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance&#160;with&#160;the light on/off ratio higher than 2000, the responsivity of 40.57 A W&#8722;1, and specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#160;Jones. Such progress demonstrates that the capillary&#8208;bridge strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality BHJ micropatterns arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Solid Phase Glycan Synthesis: ASGS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid phase synthesis is the most dominant approach for the preparation of biological oligomers as it enables the introduction of monomers iteratively. Accelerated solid phase synthesis of biological oligomers is crucial for chemical biology, but its application to the synthesis of oligosaccharides is not trivial. Solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide assembly is a slow process performed in a variety of conditions and temperatures, requires an inert gas atmosphere, and demands high excess of glycosyl donors. The process is done in special synthesizers and poor mixing of the solid support increases the risk of diffusion&#8208;independent hydrolysis of the activated donors. High shear stirring is a new way to accelerate solid phase synthesis. The efficient mixing ensures that reactive intermediates can diffuse faster to the solid support thereby increasing the kinetics of the reactions. We report here a stirring&#8208;based accelerated solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis. We harnessed high shear mixing to perform diffusion&#8208;dependent glycosylation in a short reaction time. We minimized the use of glycosyl donors and the need to use an inert atmosphere. We showed that by tailoring the deprotection and glycosylation conditions to the same temperature, assembly steps are performed continuously, and full glycosylation cycles is completed in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Anionic Ligands on Photoreactivity in Mo(VI) Dioxo Complexes of the Form MoO2X2(NN)
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study into the light&#8208;initiated C&#8722;H activation reactivity by MoO2X2(bpy) elucidates the critical role of a bpy&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. With stronger donating anionic ancillary ligands, the first excited state involves a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer from the anionic ancillary ligand (X), which initiated radical decomposition instead of C&#8722;H activation via the metal oxo motif.







Abstract
The photoreactivity of d0 metal dioxo complexes in activating C&#8722;H bonds has been recently studied.[1&#8211;3] We have previously reported that MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) is an effective platform for light initiated C&#8722;H activation with unique product selectivity for the overall functionalization.[1] Herein we expand on these studies and report the synthesis and photoreactivity of several new Mo(VI) dioxo complexes with the general formula MoO2(X)2(NN); where X=F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, CH3&#8722;, PhO&#8722;, tBuO&#8722; and NN=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;tBu). Among these compounds, MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) and MoO2Br2(bpy&#8208;tBu) are able to participate in bimolecular photoreactivity with several substrates containing C&#8722;H bonds of various types such as allyls, benzyls, aldehydes (RCHO) and alkanes. MoO2(CH3)2bpy and MoO2(PhO)2bpy do not participate in bimolecular photoreactions and instead they undergo photodecompositions. Computational studies indicate that the nature of the HOMO and LUMO is critical in supporting photoreactivity, with access to an LMCT (bpy&#8594;Mo) being necessary for tractable hydrocarbon functionalization.

         <title>Reactivity of Silylene with Gallium&#8208; and Boron Trihalide at Reductive Conditions Resulting in Unforeseen Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galliumhalosilanes: Synthesis of a first compound comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms. Where one gallium presents between two silylene and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. The oxidation state of the gallium and silicon atoms remains the same even after the reduction. Further reaction of silylene with boron halide leads to the formation of silylene&#8208;boron adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot reaction of gallium and boron halides with potassium graphite in the presence of benzamidinate stabilized silylene LSi&#8208;R, (L=PhC(NtBu)2). The reaction of LSiCl with an equivalent amount of GaI3 in the presence of KC8 leads to the direct substitution of one chloride group by gallium diiodide simultaneously additional coordination of silylene resulted in L(Cl)Si&#8594;GaI2&#8208;Si(L)&#8594;GaI3 (1). In compound 1, the structure comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms where one gallium presents between two silylenes and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. In this Lewis acid&#8208;base reaction the oxidation states of the starting materials remain unchanged. The same is valid in the silylene boron adduct formation of L(tBu)Si&#8208;BPhCl2 (2) and L(tBu)Si&#8208;BBr3 (3). This new route provides access to galliumhalosilanes challenging to synthesize by any other method.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Decorated Nonaromatic Amine Emitters Towards Efficient Triplet Exciton Utilization in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possessed powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, sulfur atom is particularly attractive for boosting triplet exciton utilization in electroluminescence. Here, the sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine compounds served as thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emitters for highly efficient OLED applications are highlighted.







Abstract
Purely organic compounds served as promising materials for organic electronics have intrigued extensive research focuses owing to their unique photophysical and electronic properties. In the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the utilization of triplet excitons is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance devices. In contrast to the traditional aromatic amine&#8208;based counterparts, sulfur atom with a high&#8208;level outer orbit simultaneously provides powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and striking spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect to facilitate the utilization of theoretically spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons, demonstrating great prospect in constructing highly emissive purely organic emitters for OLED applications. Herein, we summarize the currently developed sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine&#8208;based emitters exhibiting attractive photoelectronic characteristics, and gain insight into the understanding of molecular design and photophysical processes of these emitters, providing new perspectives for enriching the existing luminescent material systems and designing high&#8208;performance emitters.

         <title>Metal Complex Molecular Junctions as Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular junctions, which are composed of metal electrode&#8208;molecule&#8208;metal electrode structures, are attractive components of thermoelectric devices. In this Concept article, we discuss recent thermoelectric studies on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential utility of functional metal complex junctions for thermoelectric devices is also described.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule junctions and self&#8208;assembled monolayer junctions are attractive architectures for thermoelectric devices. However, given the poor thermoelectric performance of organic molecules investigated so far, molecules characterized by high conductance and Seebeck coefficient values are desired to be explored. Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8208;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.

         <title>Significant Control on Zero&#8208;Field Quantum Tunneling of Magnetization in Dysprosium Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets via Orientation of the Anilato Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bridging ligand orientation in a dinuclear Dy(III) complex provides different coordination geometry. The geometry with higher axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) around DyIII centre gives higher energy barrier (Ueff) than the low order symmetric geometry [triangular dodecahedron geometry (pseudo D2d)] due to the large difference in their transverse anisotropy.







Abstract
Tuning the bridging fashion of anilato ligand in dinuclear DyIII complexes, reveals a sizable effect on the slow relaxation of magnetization. Combined experimental and theoretical studies divulge that the geometry with high order axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) reduces the transverse crystal fields corresponding to QTM (quantum tunneling of magnetization) resulting in a significant increase in energy barrier (Ueff=518&#8197;cm&#8722;1) through the Orbach relaxation process whereas the geometry with lower symmetry (triangular dodecahedron, pseudo D2d) enhances the transverse crystal fields that accelerate the ground state QTM process. Notably, the value 518&#8197;cm&#8722;1 represents the highest energy barrier among anilato ligand based SMMs.

         <title>Differently N&#8208;Capped Analogues of Fmoc&#8208;FF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues were collected and analyzed in their morphological, mechanical, and functional features, highlighting the effects caused by the Fmoc&#8208; modification.







Abstract
Short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been recently envisioned as excellent building blocks for the formulation of hydrogels with appealing properties. Due to its simplicity and capability to gel under physiological conditions, Fmoc&#8208;FF (N&#945;&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;diphenylalanine), remains one of the most studied low molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators. Since its first identification in 2006, a plethora of its analogues were synthetized and investigated for the fabrication of novel supramolecular materials. Here we report a description of the Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues in which the aromatic Fmoc group is replaced with other substituents. These analogues are distinguished into five different classes including derivatives: i) customized with solid phase peptide synthesis protecting groups; ii) containing non&#8208;aromatic groups, iii) containing aromatic groups, iv) derivatized with metal complexes and v) containing stimuli&#8208;responsive groups. The morphological, mechanical, and functional effects caused by this modification on the resulting material are also pointed out.

         <title>Sparkling Organic Phosphorescence from Fluorinated Tetrathia[7]helicenes: Synthesis and Photophysical, Electrochemical and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putting a green spin on [7]TH: Fluorination of the tetrathia[7]helicene backbone disclosed important functionalization&#8208;related structure&#8208;electronic alterations crucial in the design of novel chiral derivatives. [7]THs also show brilliant green phosphorescence resulting from enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) due to an S&#8208;atom effect and distortion annulation.







Abstract
Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial beacuse most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine&#8208;containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes, highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared in high yields through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550&#8197;nm, and the studies suggest an efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet nonplanar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements, while DFT calculations enable a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations to be defined.

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform mechanochemical method for the partial reduction of TiO2 and Nb2O5 to the corresponding black oxides using NaH and LiH as reducing agents was developed. As shown by EPR spectroscopy, unpaired electrons were generated, and the obtained oxides exhibit better photocatalytic activity than the pristine oxides.







Abstract
Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. This study reports the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ into the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.

         <title>A Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8722;H Olefination Strategy and Its Application Towards Global Proteome Profiling of &#916;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that empowers activity&#8208;based proteome profiling of &#916;8&#8208;THC, a psychoactive natural product from Cannabis sativa, through a late&#8208;stage arene olefination method is described. This olefination method is capable of converting non&#8208;covalent acting compounds, such as &#916;8&#8208;THC, into activity&#8208;based probes after silyl deprotection. Its ability to interrogate protein interaction landscape of &#916;8&#8208;THC is then compared with AfBPP.







Abstract
Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such reliance on innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture restricted its applications to covalent acting compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8722;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H olefination with an arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#916;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4&#8201;db, a &#916;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with AfBP 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#916;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8722;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism-of-action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such reliance on innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture restricted its applications to covalent acting compounds. Late-stage C&#8722;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8722;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron-rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated esters, via late-stage C&#8722;H olefination with an arylthio-based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co-workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#916;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &lt;b&gt;&#945;-4&#8201;db&lt;/b&gt;, a &#916;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-THC-based probe, to its native target hCB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R. In combination with A&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;BP &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, a photoaffinity-based derivative of &#916;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8722;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non-covalent drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the synthesis, characterization and basic physiochemical properties of two novel heteroatom&#8208;doped PAHs (BTF and BTT). The studies on their singlet fission (SF) show that the efficiency of BTT is higher than that of BTF by two times while the triplet generation time of BTT becomes slower compared with BTF, indicating that the introduction of sulfur atom has a significant influence on the SF process.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8211;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2&#8197;times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyst C70 was introduced for the facile construction of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines under mild conditions, yielding a diverse library of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Low catalyst loading, gram scale synthesis, and broad substrate scope (48 examples) demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol and encourage its future application as a photoredox catalyst in organic transformations.







Abstract
Herein, fullerene (C70) is introduced as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#934;&#9653;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical by energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism. The superoxide radical acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process. Azomethine ylide further participates in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Heterobiaryls through Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral heterobiaryls have wide applications in chiral ligands, catalysts, and bioactive compounds, which have aroused great interest in the chemistry community. This review provides a summary of the recent atroposelective synthesis strategies of heterobiaryls via ring&#8208;formation approaches involving transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which have aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic heterobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarize the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through ring formation approaches, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also discussed.

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin (FePEG5kTPP) formed an 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with a face&#8208;to&#8208;face cyclodextrin dimer in aqueous solution. The O2 adduct of the ferrous complex shows similar O2 binding affinity with natural hemoglobin and a long circulation time in blood, leading to the simple supramolecular complex that can be used as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur is described. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is much greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.
