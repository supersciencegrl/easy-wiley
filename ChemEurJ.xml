         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;switchable supramolecular nano&#8208;objects that respond with size and shape changes to the irradiation with different wavelengths have been built from two different water&#8208;soluble molecular switches, joint through attachment to the same polyelectrolyte. Accordingly, two wavelength&#8208;specific reactions, namely the excited&#8208;state proton dissociation of a photoacid and the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of an azo dye, are combined in one supramolecular nano&#8208;object stable in an aqueous solution. The concept bears potential in the fields of sensors, molecular motors, and transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, i.e., the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination ("anti&#8208;Wacker"&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.</dc:description>

         <title>Tweaking the Optoelectronic Properties of S&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Chemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S&#8208;doped analog of&#160;peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2&#160;led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid&#8208;state arrangements with face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#160;p&#8208;p&#160;stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S&#8208;atoms, with the bis&#8208;sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00&#160;= 2.99 eV). While peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their&#160;n&#8208;type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10&#8208;1&#8208;10&#8208;2&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;and 10&#8208;2&#8208;10&#8208;3&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far. Finally, the electroluminescence properties of the complexes were tested in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), obtaining the first mid&#8208;emitting PAH&#8208;based LECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Exploration on the Role of Magnetic States to the N2&#160;Fixation behaviors of 2D Transition Metal Tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fixing nitrogen (N2) by electrosynthesis method has become a promising way to ammonia (NH3) production, nevertheless, developing electrocatalysts combining long&#8208;term stable and low&#8208;cost feathers are&#160;still a great challenge to date. Using comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations, we herein investigate the potential of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s) as nitrogen reduction reaction&#160;(NRR) electrocatalysts, and explore the effect of magnetic orders on the NRR. Our results show that the TMB3s can sufficiently activate N2&#160;and convert it to NH3. Particularly, TiB3&#160;is identified as a&#160;high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for NRR because of its low limiting potential (&#8208;0.24 V) and good suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, we present that these TMB3s with various magnetic states exhibit different performances in the adsorption of N2&#160;and NRR intermediates, and minor effect on activation of N2.&#160;Besides, VB3, CrB3, MnB3, and FeB3&#160;monolayers possess the superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation via the self&#8208;activating process, which reduces *O/*OH into *H2O under NRR electrochemical conditions, thus favoring the N2&#160;electroreduction.&#160;This work paves the way for finding high&#8208;performance NRR catalysts for transition metal borides&#160;and pioneering the research of magnetic states effects in NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: from Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>17  O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of  17  O (0.04%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient  17  O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides, using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to ~ 40%, yields ~ 60&#8208;85%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently,  17  O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/  t  Bu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective  17  O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with ~ 28% enrichment level. For all molecules,  17  O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Peptide Probe for Protein Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Thus, the selection of biometric molecules with good selectivity and high affinity is very important. Among them, peptide with lots of obvious advantages like good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, variety, strong functionality, flexible chemical modification, etc. has attracted numerous attentions.

         <title>Edge Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates needed for conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for construction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined via a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization.&#160; The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12&#8208;14 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Metal Incorporation Effect of Steady&#8208;Active FeP Hydrogen Evolution Nanocatalysts for Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides are promising noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but they usually suffer from inferior stability and thus are far from the device applications. We reported a facile and controllable synthetic method to prepare metal&#8208;incorporated M&#8208;FeP nanoparticles (M= Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Mo) with the guide of the density functional theory (DFT). The evaluated HER activity sequence was consistent with the DFT predictions, and cobalt was revealed to be the appropriate dopant. With the optimization of the Co/Fe ratio, the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C only required overpotentials of 67 mV and 129 mV to obtain the cathodic current density of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. It maintained the initial activity in the 10 hours stability test, surpassing the other Co&#8208;FeP/C catalysts. Ex&#8208;situ experiments demonstrated that the decreased element leaching and the increased surface phosphide content contributed to the high stability of the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer was assembled using the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C as the cathodic catalyst. It showed a current density of 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 at the applied voltage of 2.0 V and retained the initial activity in the 1000 cycles&#8217; stability test, suggesting the potential application of the catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Crystalline Carbon&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Triphenylamine Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing luminescent radicals with tunable emission is a challenging task due to the limitation of alternative skeletons. Herein, a series of carbene&#8211;triphenylamine hybrids were prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene with 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline. These hybrids showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to carbon&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with blue&#8208;to&#8208;cyan emissions (&#955;max: 436&#8211;486 nm) or nitrogen&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with orange emissions (&#955;max: 590&#8211;623 nm) through chemical reduction or oxidation, respectively. The radical species were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry analysis. Notably, the corresponding nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals exhibited good stability in atmospheric air, and their thermal decomposition temperatures were determined to be above 200&#176;C. In addition, spectral and theoretical calculations indicate that all radicals exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha emissions</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Isonitrile&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Complex Biological Matrices Through Ligation with Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products have garnered attention for their manifold bioactivities but are difficult to detect and isolate due to the chemical lability of the isonitrile functional group. Here, we used isonitrile&#8208;chlorooxime ligation (INC) in a reactivity&#8208;based screening (RBS) protocol for the detection and isolation of alkaloid and terpene isonitriles in the cyanobacterium Fischerella&#160;ambigua and the marine sponge Axinella sp., respectively. A trifunctional probe bearing a chlorooxime moiety, a UV active aromatic moiety, and a bromine label facilitated the chemoselective reaction with isonitriles, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic detection, and mass spectrometric analysis. The INC&#8208;based RBS allowed for the detection, isolation, and structural elucidation of isonitriles in microgram quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Phototheranostics based on Carbon Nanohorns for Precise Imaging&#8208;Guided Post&#8208;PDT toward Residual Tumor Cells after Initial Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising photonic material, phototheranostics can be activated in the laser irradiation range of tumor with sensitivity and spatiotemporal precision. However, it is difficult to completely eradicate solid tumors due to their irregularity and limited laser irradiation area. Herein, multi&#8208;stimulus responsive HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs were constructed with single&#8208;walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) modified hyaluronic acid (HA) via non&#8208;covalent binding. This SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics not only exhibited water dispersion but also could target tumor and be activated by near&#8208;infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs could be degraded by hyaluronidase in residual tumor cells, causing HA&#8208;Ce6 to fall off the SWNHs surfaces to restore autofluorescence, thus precisely guiding the programmed photodynamic treatments for residual tumor cells after the initial phototherapy. Thus, this work provides a rationally designed multiple&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for precise PDT/PTT and post&#8208;treatment imaging&#8208;guided PDT of residual tumor cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Screening of DalPhos/Ni Catalysts in C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;couplings of (Hetero)aryl Chlorides Enables Development of Aminopyrazole Cross&#8208;couplings with Amine Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several focused reports have appeared over the past few years documenting the utility of nickel catalysts featuring newly developed DalPhos bisphosphine ligands for C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings of typically challenging (hetero)aryl chlorides with targeted NH nucleophiles. Herein, a more expansive and systematic competitive evaluation of this ligand family in N&#8208;arylation chemistry is provided involving primary (linear and branched) and secondary alkylamines, as well as a primary five&#8208;membered heteroarylamine (aminopyrazole), in combination with a diverse set of test electrophiles and bases (NaOtBu, K2CO3, DBU/NaTFA). In addition to providing optimal ligand/catalyst identification, and bringing to light methodology limitations (e.g., unwanted C&#8208;O cross&#8208;coupling with NaOtBu), our survey enabled the development of the first efficient catalyst system for heteroatom&#8208;dense C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling of aminopyrazoles and related nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides by use of an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.</dc:description>

         <title>How Bases Catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically studied the base&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between 3hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone and N&#8208;methylmaleimide using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO2 via a retro&#8208;DA reaction. Base catalysis, e.g., by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10 kcal mol&#8211;1, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO2, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: (i) by the HOMO&#8208;raising effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and (ii) by donating charge into 3&#8208;hydroxy2&#8208;pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N&#8208;methylmaleimide.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne Activation in the Diversity Oriented Synthesis of sp2&#8208;Rich Scaffolds: A Biased Library Approach for Targeting Polynucleotides (DNA/RNA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeting of polynucleotide (RNA and DNA) topologies and their protein complexes by small molecules has enormous potential in the discovery of new therapeutics across a broad range of diseases (infectious, chronic and congenital). Polynucleotides are very different structures to proteins and have a much greater capacity to form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitably &#960;&#8208;rich small molecules. To exploit this difference, we have developed a diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis approach to &#960;&#8208;rich scaffolds from a common set of substrates. The utility of this approach has been exemplified in the discovery of a novel topoisomerase&#8208;1 inhibitor.







Abstract
Polynucleotides, DNA and RNA (mRNA and non&#8208;coding RNAs) are critically involved in the molecular pathways of disease. Small molecule binding interactions with polynucleotides can modify functional polynucleotide topologies and/or their interactions with proteins. Current approaches to library design (lead&#8208;like or fragment&#8208;like libraries) are based on protein&#8208;ligand interactions and often include careful consideration of the 3&#8208;dimensional orientation of binding motifs and exclude &#960;&#8208;rich compounds (polyfused aromatics) to avoid off&#8208;target R/DNA interactions. In contrast to proteins, where &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions are weak, polynucleotides can form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitable &#960;&#8208;rich ligands. To assist in designing a polynucleotide&#8208;biased library, a scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis approach to polyfused aromatic scaffolds has been undertaken. Initial screening hits that form moderately stable polynucleotide&#8208;ligand&#8208;protein ternary complexes can be further optimized through judicious incorporation of substituents on the scaffold to increase protein&#8208;ligand interactions. An example of this approach is given for topoisomerase&#8208;1 (TOP1), generating a novel TOP1 inhibitory chemotype.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Functionalities of Temporally Controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene conjugate acts as a conventional 1O2 sensor, a unique spatiotemporally controlled 1O2 sensor, or a good photosensitizer depending on the photoexcitation wavelengths. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that the unique multifunctionality was achieved by the unique photoexcited states of the molecule. The molecular ability in living cells was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (RA) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i) RA acts as a conventional fluorogenic 1O2 sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with 1O2. (ii) RA acts as a temporally controlled 1O2 sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (&#8764;700&#8197;nm) photosensitization. RA enters an intermediate state after capturing 1O2 and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii) RA acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate 1O2 under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and RA shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in RA offer to promise molecular tools to apply 1O2 in a spatiotemporal manner.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Double Carbonylation of Nitroarenes with Aryl Halides Using Mo(CO)6 as a Reductant and Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides has been achieved. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl source. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding nitrogen heterocycles in moderate to good yields. Notably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.







Abstract
A new palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides for the synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been reported. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl sources. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that nitrosoarene was first generated as the key intermediate through nitro reduction. Remarkably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimorpholinoacetylene has been synthesized and structurally characterized as a new member of the class of electron&#8208;rich diaminoacetylenes. The new compound can be used to produce cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes or oxidized to give the first fully characterized cyclobutadiene dication. Detailed computational studies by NICS and current density calculations were carried out to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclobutadiene dications.







Abstract
The new diaminoacetylene (DAA) dimorpholinoacetylene (3) was prepared from 1,1&#8208;dimorpholinoethene (1) by bromination to form the dibromoketene aminal 2, which upon lithiation afforded 3 through a Fritsch&#8208;Buttenberg&#8208;Wiechell rearrangement. Heating 3 at elevated temperatures resulted in a complete conversion into the dimer 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1&#8208;buten&#8208;3&#8208;yne (4), which was used for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes of the type [(CBA)MLn] (5&#8208;7; MLn=AuCl, RhCl(COD), RhCl(CO)2; CBA=1,3,4,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). The reaction of 3 with tetraethylammonium bromide gave 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetramorpholinocyclobutenylium bromide (8), which reacted with bromine to form 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra(morpholino)cyclobutenediylium bis(tribromide) (9). Compound 9 represents the first fully characterized compound containing a tetraaminocyclobutadiene dication and displays a nearly planar C4N4 core as shown by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Detailed quantum chemical calculations were performed to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclubutadiene dications by employing the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) method and current density analysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted great attention for their wide applications in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. However, the development of these materials remains a challenging task, partially due to the lack of rational molecular design strategies and unclear luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we present a method for facile access to structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives via a copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component coupling reaction, which provides a promising approach to rapidly assemble a library of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines for exploring the regularity of the host&#8208;guest doped system. A series of host&#8208;guest RTP materials with wide&#8208;range lifetimes from 4.4 to 299.3 ms were constructed by doping various substituted isoquinolines derivatives into benzophenone (BP). Furthermore, 4r/BP nanoparticles could be utilized for in vivo imaging with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) value as high as 32, revealing the potential of the isoquinoline framework for the construction of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.</dc:description>

Structural analyses reveal that all Dy(III) centers in complexes  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are nine&#8208;coordinate with hula&#8208;loop coordination geometry, and the differences between  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are the terminal coordination anion and counter anion. Magnetic studies indicate that complex  2S  displays typical SMM behaviors under a zero dc field, whereas  1S  just shows slow relaxation of magnetization resulting from a relatively weak axial crystal field.

         <title>Carba&#8208;Sugar Analogs of Glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate: New Activators for the glmS Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Riboswitches are 5'&#8208;untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistances against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self&#8208;cleavage upon binding to glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we could show that carba glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (carba&#8208;GlcN6P) induces self&#8208;cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position. Key features of the synthesis are a ring closing metathesis reaction followed by a hydroboration. The strategy gives access to libraries of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives. Ribozyme cleavage assays unraveled new activators for the glmS riboswitch from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Riboswitches are 5'-untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistances against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self-cleavage upon binding to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we could show that carba glucosamine-6-phosphate (carba-GlcN6P) induces self-cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba-GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding in Platinum Indolylphosphine Polyfluorido and Fluorido Complexes</title>

The compounds 2a&#8208;f and 3a&#8208;f were characterised thoroughly by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The data reveal hydrogen bonding of the fluorido ligand with HF molecules and the indolylphosphine ligand. Polyfluorido complexes 2a&#8208;f show larger &#9474;1J(F,Pt)&#9474;, but lower 1J(H,F) coupling constants when compared to the fluorido complexes 3a&#8208;f. Decreasing 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants in 2a&#8208;f and 3a&#8208;f suggest a cis influence of the aryl ligands in the following order: 4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (a) &#8776; 4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (b) &lt; Ph (c) &lt;&lt; 4&#8208;FC6H4 (d) &lt; 4&#8208;ClC6H4 (e) &lt; 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (f). In addition, the larger cis influence of aryl ligands bearing electron withdrawing groups in the para position correlates with decreasing magnitudes of &#9474;1J(F,Pt)&#9474; coupling constants The interpretation of the experimental data was supported by quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfation of&#160; Heparan and Chondroitin Sulfate Ligands Enables Cell Specific Homing of Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demystifying the sulfation code of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to induce precise homing of nanoparticles in tumor or neuron cells influences the development of a potential drug or gene delivery system. However, GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are structurally highly heterogeneous, and synthesizing well&#8208;defined HS/CS composed nanoparticles is challenging. Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor&#8208;mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG&#8208;nanoprobes compared to mild or moderate aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, indicating the presence of more than one receptor mediated uptake. Whereas U87 cells, olfactory bulb and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS&#8208;E coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG&#8208;nanoprobes. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;disulfated&#8208;CS nanoprobe utilized CD44 and caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis pathway for the uptake. These results imply new opportunities to use GAG nanoprobes in nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Metal Chalcogenide Semiconductors by Thermal Decomposition of Organosulfur and Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and facile solid&#8208;state synthesis method using thiourea has been investigated to obtain chalcogenide semiconductors, such as CdSxSe1&#8208;x solid solution. Thiourea was found to work as a molten reaction medium at moderate temperature, although it leaves organic residues in the solid phase.







Abstract
Metal chalcogenides &#8211; because of their excellent optical and electrical properties &#8211; are important semiconductor materials for optical devices, such as solar cells, sensors, and photocatalysts. The challenges associated with metal chalcogenides are the complexity of the conventional synthesis methods and the stringent synthesis conditions. In this study, the synthesis conditions were simplified in a solvent&#8208;free synthesis method using cadmium precursor, thiourea and selenium to synthesize metal chalcogenides, such as CdS and CdSe, which have particularly suitable band gaps for the optical devices. CdSxSe1&#8208;x solid solution was successfully synthesized under molten thiourea as the reactive reaction medium at relatively low temperatures, even at 180&#8201;&#176;C, with residual melamine derivatives in the solid phase. The luminescence properties of CdSxSe1&#8208;x and the products in the gas and solid phases were investigated. Optimization of the synthesis conditions for solid solutions of CdSxSe1&#8208;x and the role of organic compounds in the formation of metal chalcogenides are discussed.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Optical Chirality Sensing with a Sterically Encumbered Aminoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically encumbered aminoborane was designed to generate strong CD effects upon dynamic covalent binding of chiral alcohols, amino alcohols and diols. This can be used for the fast determination of the concentration, absolute configuration and enantiomeric excess of a variety of small molecules and for streamlining of small&#8208;scale asymmetric reaction analysis with less than 1&#8197;mg of crude material and without work&#8208;up.







Abstract
A sterically encumbered aminoborane sensor is introduced and used for quantitative stereochemical analysis of monoalcohols, diols and amino alcohols. The small&#8208;molecule probe exhibits a rigid ortho&#8208;substituted arene scaffold with a proximate boron binding site and a triarylamine circular dichroism (CD) reporter unit which proved to be crucial for the observed chiroptical signal induction. Coordination of the chiral target molecule produces strong Cotton effects and UV changes that are readily correlated to its absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition and concentration to achieve comprehensive stereochemical analysis within a 5&#8201;% absolute error margin. The sensing method was successfully applied in the chromatography&#8208;free analysis of less than one milligram of a crude asymmetric reaction mixture and the advantages of this chiroptical sensing approach, which is amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation equipment and automation, over traditional methods is discussed.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer 2D Ni&#8722;BDC MOF Obtained in Supercritical CO2&#8208;Assisted Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>

A chip off the old MOF: A CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules and side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni sites on Ni&#8722;BDC surface simultaneously; finally this breaks the interlayer hydrogen bond of bulk Ni&#8722;BDC and helps to form 2D MOF.







Abstract
The development of an efficient strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with high yield and high stability is desirable. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that large, single&#8208;layer 2D nickel&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate (Ni&#8722;BDC) MOF nanosheets can be fabricated with the assistance of supercritical (SC) CO2 in a pure aqueous system. Detailed experimental evidence reveals that the SC CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules, side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni1 sites on the Ni&#8722;BDC surface, and finally break the interlayer hydrogen bond to exfoliate the bulk Ni&#8722;BDC into a 2D MOF. More importantly, a thin SC CO2 layer building up at the water&#8722;Ni&#8722;BDC interfaces can transform the pristine hydrophilic interface into a super&#8208;hydrophobic one. This super&#8208;hydrophobic layer at the water&#8208;MOF interface can effectively prevent dissociation, thus promoting the stability of Ni&#8722;BDC in aqueous system.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of Nicotinamide Co&#8208;factor by Perylene Sensitized RhIII Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytically active intramolecular photocatalyst, which combines a perylene photosensitizer and a RhIII catalyst. Spectroscopic studies reveal the formation of a charge&#8208;separated perylene radical cation&#8208;RhII intermediate that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.







Abstract
The ambitious goal of artificial photosynthesis is to develop active systems that mimic nature and use light to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Intramolecular design concepts are particularly promising. Herein, we firstly present an intramolecular photocatalyst integrating a perylene&#8208;based light&#8208;harvesting moiety and a catalytic rhodium center (RhIIIphenPer). The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The studies reveal that photoexcitation of RhIIIphenPer yields the formation of a charge&#8208;separated intermediate, namely RhIIphenPer&#8901;+, that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Sulfoxides by an Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear oxidation&#8208;reduction bienzymatic cascade was designed to synthesize chiral sulfoxides starting from sulfides. The combinatorial cascade gave a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides in excellent optical purity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) with complementary chirality. The cascade combines the superb stability of CiVCPO and enantioselectivity of MsrA/MsrB, as a result, it not only allows CiVCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provides a powerful approach for (S)&#8208;sulfide synthesis.







Abstract
Chiral sulfoxides are versatile synthons and have gained a particular interest in asymmetric synthesis of active pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. Herein, a linear oxidation&#8211;reduction bienzymatic cascade to synthesize chiral sulfoxides is reported. The extraordinarily stable and active vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) was used to oxidize sulfides into racemic sulfoxides, which were then converted to chiral sulfoxides by highly enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) and B (MsrB) by kinetic resolution, respectively. The combinatorial cascade gave a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides with excellent optical purity (&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197; ee) with complementary chirality. The enzymatic cascade requires no NAD(P)H recycling, representing a facile method for chiral sulfoxide synthesis. Particularly, the envisioned enzymatic cascade not only allows CiVCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provides a powerful approach for (S)&#8208;sulfoxide synthesis; the latter case is significantly unexplored for heme&#8208;dependent peroxidases and peroxygenases.

         <title>Modulation of the Sorption Characteristics for an H&#8208;bonded porous Architecture by Varying the Chemical Functionalization of the Channel Walls</title>

Fine tuning of gas sorption properties and I2 capture/release was achieved by variation of the functional group(s) decorating the channels of a microporous H&#8208;bonded framework material.







Abstract
Five isostructural microporous supramolecular architectures prepared by H&#8208;bonded assembly between the hexa&#8208;anionic complex [Zr2(Ox)7]6&#8722; (Ox=oxalate, (C2O4)2&#8722;) and tripodal cations (H3&#8208;TripCH2&#8208;R)3+ with R=H, CH3, OH and OBn (Bn=CH2Ph) are reported. The possibility to obtain the same structure using a mixture of tripodal cations with different R group (R=OH and R=CH3) has also been successfully explored, providing a unique example of three&#8208;component H&#8208;bonded porous framework. The resulting SPA&#8208;1(R) materials feature 1D pores decorated by R groups, with apparent pore diameters ranging from 3.0 to 8.5&#8197;&#197;. Influence of R groups on the sorption properties of these materials is evidenced through CO2 and H2O vapor sorption/desorption experiments, as well as with I2 capture/release experiments in liquid media. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the possibility of tuning the porosity and exerting precise control over the chemical functionalization of the pores in a given H&#8208;bonded structure, without modifying the topology of the reference structure, and thus finely adjusting the sorption characteristics of the material.

We report an approach to construct two structurally different (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine and boranil&#8208;based) CMPs from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (BF3.Et2O and CH3COOH). The polymers display distinctly different optical and electronic properties. Boranil CMP display superior photocatalytic activity producing hydrogen at a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol/g over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine polymer (100&#8197;&#956;mol/g).







Abstract
Simple synthetic modifications that tune the molecular structures, thereby the properties of the molecules, are of topical interest. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel cationic rosaniline&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (Acetic acid and BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O). The condensation reaction of rosaniline with 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol in acetic acid renders &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP (CMP&#8208;A) while changing the acid to BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O, the linkages transform to enol and undergoes BF2&#8208;complexation, leading to boranil CMP (CMP&#8208;B). BF2&#8208;functionalities in boranil CMP significantly modified the optical and functional properties compared to &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP. The cationic&#8208;delocalization along with the extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization supported by chromophoric BF2&#8208;groups allow CMP&#8208;B to exhibit broad absorption spanning the visible to Near&#8208;Infrared region (NIR). The absorption red&#8208;edge of CMP&#8208;B appears around 1277&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.58&#8197;eV) while CMP&#8208;A displays at 981&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.83&#8197;eV). Most interestingly, as a photocatalyst, CMP&#8208;B catalyzes hydrogen evolution with a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 over CMP&#8208;A (100&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). It is about 2.5&#8197;times higher performance. The transient photocurrent measurements, electrochemical impedance data, and in&#8208;depth mott&#8208;Schottky analysis demonstrate that the BF2&#8208;group in CMP&#8208;B generates photoinduced charge carriers and their migration towards the active sites for photocatalysis. These polymers show significant photocatalytic H2 generation without any supportive metal co&#8208;catalyst. The BF2 complexed building blocks are a unique class of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution through green and cost&#8208;effective approach.

         <title>Fabrication of Highly Luminescent and Thermally Stable Phosphors through In&#8208;Situ Formation of BaSO4 on Sulfur Nanodots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent and thermally stable hybrid phosphors of sulfur nanodots@BaSO4 were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation method. Sulfur nanodots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO4, and BaSO4 provides passivation effect for surface ligands or traps, resulting in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO4 matrix also leads to promotion of thermal stability.







Abstract
Producing high performance phosphors using abundant and non&#8208;toxic precursors yet straightforward methods are promising but still a challenging task. Herein, highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation synthesis strategy. Sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots) act as the precursors for precipitation reactions and also provide the luminescent centers. Structural and optical characterization investigations suggest that S&#8208;dots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO4, and BaSO4 provides passivation effect for the surface ligands or traps of S&#8208;dots. This results in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO4 matrix also leads to the obvious promotion of thermal stability. These merits endow the construction of phosphor&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes by utilizing the S&#8208;dots@BaSO4 hybrid phosphors as a color conversion layer. These research results are significant for developing sulfur&#8208;based luminescent materials, and also provide a solid and universal theory to produce high quality phosphors.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Towards ultrasensitive SERS analysis: Magneto&#8208;plasmonic dendrimer&#8208;based colloids have been explored for the adsorption and SERS detection of contaminants in water quality monitoring assisted by magnetic separation. Three chemical routes &#8211; crosslinking, chemical grafting, and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly &#8211; led to hybrid nanostructures with distinct potentialities.







Abstract
Chemical analyses in the field using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocols are expected to be part of several analytical procedures applied to water quality monitoring. To date, these endeavors have been supported by developments in SERS substrate nanofabrication, instrumentation portability, and the internet of things. Here, we report distinct chemical strategies for preparing magneto&#8208;plasmonic (Fe3O4&#8201;:&#8201;Au) colloids, which are relevant in the context of trace&#8208;level detection of water contaminants due to their inherent multifunctionality. The main objective of this research is to investigate the role of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAMs) in the preparation of SERS substrates integrating both functionalities into single nanostructures. Three chemical routes were investigated to design magneto&#8208;plasmonic nanostructures that translate into different ways for assessing SERS detection by using distinct interfaces. Hence, a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic colloids have been characterized and then assessed for their SERS activity by using a model pesticide (thiram) dissolved in aqueous samples.

A new AgGaS2&#8208;type sulfide (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 with compressed chalcopyrite&#8208;like structure was obtained. It exhibits balanced NLO properties, including moderate SHG response, wide band gap, and high LIDT.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;power solid&#8208;state lasers is in urgent need of infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with wide band gaps and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs). Herein, a new compressed chalcopyrite&#8208;like IR NLO crystal (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 was successfully synthesized using a facile high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure can be considered as a variant of chalcopyrite AgGaS2 (AGS)&#8208;type ones. It features a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by corner&#8208;sharing {[(Na/Ag)S4]7&#8722;}&#8734; layers and isolated SnS4 tetrahedra with negative cavities occupied by counter ion Ba2+. (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable moderate SHG response (0.31 &#215; AGS), wide band gap (3.70&#8197;eV), and high LIDT (6.44 &#215; AGS). Theoretical calculations reveal that the NLO response of (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 is mainly originated from the synergetic effects of AgS4 and SnS4 tetrahedra, and the inclusion of alkaline and alkaline earth metals is responsible for the wide band gap and high LIDT. Moreover, the discovery of this chalcopyrite&#8208;like compound will provide a feasible design strategy for the exploration of new promising IR NLO materials.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Emission and Aggregate Emission of Aroyl&#8208; S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals Are Controlled and Tuned by Their Substitution Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By expanding the library of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals to 111 examples, it was possible to fully control their photophysical properties &#8211; ranging from emission color to quantum yield &#8211; in the solid and aggregated states. Thorough analysis then allowed all aspects of these properties to be tuned.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are a novel highly diverse class of aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogens (AIEgens) with a plethora of interesting properties. An expanded compound library of more than 110 dyes set the stage for the first qualitative control and tuneability of all aspects of their photophysical properties. The interplay of substituents not only allows tuning and prediction of the emission color, but also of the intensity, and quantum yields both in solids and in the aggregated state; these can be rationalized by scrutinizing intermolecular interactions in the crystalline solid state.

         <title>Coordination Adaptable Networks: Zirconium(IV) Carboxylates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into shape again: Coordination adaptable networks (CooANs) are reshapable materials based on the dynamic and degenerate exchange of coordinative bonds. The materials described here, built by ligand exchange from [Zr6O4(OH)4(O2CMe)12] and a carboxylic acid&#8208;containing polymer matrix, which yields [Zr6O4(OH)4]&#8208;based crosslinks, display vitrimer&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Vitrimers are 3D &#8220;covalent adaptable networks&#8221; (CANs) with flow properties thanks to thermally activated associative exchange reactions. This contribution introduces coordination adaptable networks, or CooANs, that are topologically related to metal&#8211;organic frameworks with octahedral Zr6 clusters as secondary building units in a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylate&#8208;methacrylate copolymer matrix. A series of Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;x materials (x=percent of Zr6 loading relative to maximum capacity) was synthesized with x=5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 and 100. The mechanical and rheological investigations demonstrate vitrimer&#8208;like properties for x up to 50, the crosslink migration being ensured by carboxylate ligand exchange, with relaxation becoming slower as the Zr6 content is increased. The flow activation energy of Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;10 is 92.9&#177;3.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Rapid (30&#8197;min) hot&#8208;press reshaping occurs at temperatures in the 50&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C range under a 3&#8208;ton pressure and does not significantly alter the material properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficient Ultrathin PdCuMo Porous Nanosheets with Abundant Defects for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets with rich cavities and structural defects have been successfully prepared by a simple method. Due to the novel structures which can provide extensive active sites and the electronic interaction between Cu, Pd and Mo elements, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets display outstanding catalytic activities and stabilities.







Abstract
To reduce the over&#8208;dependence on Pt, Pd&#8208;based catalysts have become one of the most effective candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In order to further accelerate the ORR kinetics and strengthen the catalytic performance of Pd catalysts, component optimization and morphology design have been adopted. Although great progress has been made, it is still difficult to obtain porous ultrathin nanosheets with excellent performance by a simple method. Here, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets (PdCuMo NSs) were successfully prepared. This structure possessed a large specific surface area with rich cavities and structural defects, significantly enhancing its ORR performance. In special, the mass activity of PdCuMo NSs was 1.46&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V, which was 12.2, 8.6, and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of Pd/C, Pt/C, and PdCuMo nanoparticles (PdCuMo NPs), respectively. In addition, it had an excellent ability to resist CO poisoning and exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Water Reduction and Dihydrogen Addition in Aqueous Conditions With ansa&#8208;Phosphinoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water reduction and H2 activation by an ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged phosphinoborane compound are demonstrated. The mechanisms of these transformations are investigated using kinetic measurements and DFT calculations. Nuclear spin hyperpolarization is detected as a result of parahydrogen (para&#8208;H2) activation by the phosphinoborane in the presence of water, proving the reversibility of water addition to this compound.







Abstract
Ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged phosphinoborane (2,6&#8208;Cl2Ph)2B&#8208;C6H4&#8208;PCy2 1 was synthesized in three steps from commercially available starting materials. 1 reacts with H2 or H2O under mild conditions to form corresponding zwitterionic phosphonium borates 1&#8208;H2 or 1&#8208;H2O. NMR studies revealed both reactions to be remarkably reversible. Thus, when exposed to H2, 1&#8208;H2O partially converts to 1&#8208;H2 even in the presence of multiple equivalents of water in the solution. The addition of parahydrogen to 1 leads to nuclear spin hyperpolarization both in dry and hydrous solvents, confirming the dissociation of 1&#8208;H2O to free 1. These observations were supported by computational studies indicating that the formation of 1&#8208;H2 and 1&#8208;H2O from 1 are thermodynamically favored. Unexpectedly, 1&#8208;H2O can release molecular hydrogen to form phosphine oxide 1&#8208;O. Kinetic, mechanistic, and computational (DFT) studies were used to elucidate the unique &#8220;umpolung&#8221; water reduction mechanism.

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic chelates sometimes offer peripheral bonding for partially hydrolyzed multivalent cations clusters rather than their tight encapsulation inside the chelate &#8220;cage&#8221;. DOTA and DOTP chelates (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;(tetrayl)tetraacetic acid) and &#8208;(tetra(methylene phosphonic acid)), respectively) were used to study these chemical and structural motifs with the tetravalent cerium cation in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
The coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds were studied by using the ligands DOTA and DOTP (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of a highly ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements of the latter suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual decomposition in solution leads to the accumulation of the in&#8208;cage complexes [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in this study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the above&#8208;mentioned species, the in&#8208;cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the in&#8208;cage complexes studied herein and similar structures published previously suggests that hard&#8208;bonding cyclen&#8208;derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies for the Rational Design of Multivalent Glycodendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interaction analysis of B antigen 16&#8208;mers (glycodendrimers), which differ with respect to the length of their linkers, with their IgM antibody revealed that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, contributes significantly to the multivalency. These results suggest that in addition to the chelation ability, high&#8208;density glycan&#8208;presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should also be taken into consideration in glycodendrimer design.







Abstract
We have synthesized B&#8208;antigen&#8208;displaying dendrimers (16&#8208;mers) with different sizes and evaluated their affinity to their IgM antibody in order to investigate which design features lead to effective multivalency. Unexpectedly, the smallest dendrimer, which cannot chelate the multiple binding sites of IgM, clearly exhibited multivalency, together with an affinity similar to or higher than those of the larger dendrimers. These results indicate that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, significantly contributes to the multivalency of glycodendrimers. Namely, in the design of glycodendrimers, high&#8208;density glycan presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should be considered in addition to the ability to chelate multiple binding sites. This notion stands in contrast to the currently prevailing scientific consensus, which prioritizes the chelation model. This study thus provides new and important guidelines for molecular design of glycodendrimers.

Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Whereas bioorthogonal chemistry allows for a pretargeting approach. Herein, we demonstrate &#8208; for the first time &#8208; the possibility to successfully ligate Tz&#8208;AuNPs in&#8197;vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies.







Abstract
Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry for theranostic strategies offers the possibility to develop next generation nanomedicines. These materials are thought to increase therapeutic outcome and improve current cancer management. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Thus, they can be used for drug delivery purposes. Bioorthogonal chemistry allows for a pretargeting approach. Higher target&#8208;to&#8208;background drug accumulation ratios can be achieved. Pretargeting can also be used to induce internalization processes or trigger controlled drug release. Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted widespread interest as drug delivery vectors within the last decades. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility to successfully ligate AuNPs in&#8197;vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies. We believe that this possibility will facilitate the development of AuNPs for clinical use and ultimately, improve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art patient care.

Intrigued by their (anti)aromaticity and expected negative curvature, a series of &#960;&#8208;extended pleiadienes has been synthesized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation. Their structural, redox and optical properties were probed and further investigated by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation of 1&#8208;boraphenalenes with ortho&#8208;dihaloarenes afforded negatively curved &#960;&#8208;extended pleiadienes. Two benzo[1,2&#8208;i:4,5&#8208;i&#8217;]dipleiadienes (BDPs) featuring a seven&#8208;six&#8208;seven&#8208;membered ring arrangement were synthesized and investigated. Their crystal structure revealed a unique packing arrangement and theoretical calculations were employed to shed light onto the dynamic behavior of the BDP moiety and its aromaticity. Further, a naphthalene&#8208;fused pleiadiene was stitched together by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to yield an additional five&#8208;membered ring. This formal azulene moiety led to distinct changes in optical and redox properties and increased perturbation of the aromatic system.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Encapsulation&#8208;Controlled Supramolecular Photoproduct and Radical Fluorescence Emission</title>

Control and stabilize: A host&#8211;guest interaction controlled photoproduct and organic radical fluorescence emission by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. Tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) derivatives can be assembled as cationic guests by the Q[7] host to form a [5]pseudorotaxane in aqueous solution. The host stabilizes the radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest, thus implying that the macrocyclic assembly has potential applications in the development of luminescent radical materials.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest interaction&#8211;controlled photoproduct created by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. The assembly exhibited controlled behavior towards the reduction of the ethylene (C=C) bond in the tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) guest molecule under UV light irradiation. This can be attributed to the Q[7] encapsulation masking the four pyridinium arms of the guest, which inhibits planarization of the TPyE core to form the cyclization product. In particular, the strong affinity of Q[7] for the butyl&#8208;substituted guest (TPyE&#8208;4C) led to an unusual radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest molecule being observed in aqueous solution. This work provides a valuable paradigm and new insight for macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions in supramolecular catalysis and luminescent radical materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Control and stabilize&lt;/b&gt;: A host&#8211;guest interaction controlled photoproduct and organic radical fluorescence emission by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])-based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. Tetrakis(pyridin-4-yl)ethylene (TPyE) derivatives can be assembled as cationic guests by the Q[7] host to form a [5]pseudorotaxane in aqueous solution. The host stabilizes the radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation-triggered intermediate of the guest, thus implying that the macrocyclic assembly has potential applications in the development of luminescent radical materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a host&#8211;guest interaction&#8211;controlled photoproduct created by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])-based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. The assembly exhibited controlled behavior towards the reduction of the ethylene (C=C) bond in the tetrakis(pyridin-4-yl)ethylene (TPyE) guest molecule under UV light irradiation. This can be attributed to the Q[7] encapsulation masking the four pyridinium arms of the guest, which inhibits planarization of the TPyE core to form the cyclization product. In particular, the strong affinity of Q[7] for the butyl-substituted guest (TPyE-4C) led to an unusual radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation-triggered intermediate of the guest molecule being observed in aqueous solution. This work provides a valuable paradigm and new insight for macrocycle-based host&#8722;guest interactions in supramolecular catalysis and luminescent radical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanozymes with Free Substrate Access for Catalyzing the Ligation of ssDNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reverse microemulsion template docking surface imprinting (RMTD&#8208;SI) is proposed as an approach to prepare nanozyme for the ligation of ssDNA. For two short ssDNA substrates that are half&#8208;complementary to the imprinted cavity, good catalytic activity and specificity towards substrate ssDNA were achieved. In addition, the prepared nanozyme allowed the ligation of a ssDNA substrate fully matched with the imprinted cavity with other ssDNA substrates, generating longer ssDNA sequences. Thus, the RMTD&#8208;SI approach opens a new avenue to the preparation of molecularly imprinted nanozymes.







Abstract
Nanozymes have attracted wide attention for the unique advantages of low cost, high stability and designability. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have demonstrated great potential as a new type of nanozymes due to their excellent specificity and high affinity. However, effective approaches for creating molecularly imprinted nanozymes still remain limited. Herein, reverse microemulsion template docking surface imprinting (RMTD&#8208;SI) is reported as a new approach for the rational design and engineering of nanozymes with free substrate access for the ligation of ssDNA sequences. As a proof of the principle, octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were successfully prepared. Using tetradeoxyribonucleotides and octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide as substrates, the properties, catalytic activity and behavior of the imprinted nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated. The imprinted nanozyme exhibited an enhanced reaction speed (by up to 41&#8208;fold) and good sequence selectivity towards substrate tetra&#8208;deoxyribonucleotides. More interestingly, due to the open substrate access, the imprinted nanozyme also allowed the ligation of a ssDNA that fully matched with the imprinted cavity and other ssDNA substrates to form longer sequences, but at the price of substrate selectivity. Thus, this study provides not only a new avenue to the rational design and synthesis of molecularly imprinted nanozymes but also new insights of their catalytic behavior.

Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals put a novel, promising class of dyes on the stage of AIEgens. Like a puppet on a string, all their photophysical properties like AIE and solid&#8208;state emission properties, the starting point of aggregation and, as shown by Hirshfeld analysis, the solid&#8208;state quantum yield can easily be fine&#8208;tuned and completely controlled by the choice and interplay of substituents at the aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetal.

Dendritic nanoarchitectures allow myriads of chemical strategies for designing hybrid multifunctional materials containing magnetic and plasmonic nanoparticles. Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are explored in a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of a pesticide dissolved in water. The Fe3O4 particles assist the magnetic separation of the dendritic sorbents from aqueous samples for subsequent SERS analysis of molecular adsorbates on gold. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Trindade and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202382).

         <title>Cover Feature: DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions (Chem. Eur. J. 61/2022)</title>

A group of researchers from NRCN, Ben Gurion University and the CEA shows that cyclen&#8208;derived, hard&#8208;bonding ligands facilitate the formation of tetravalent cerium cations bearing oxo/hydroxo clusters in aqueous solutions. The clusters eventually decompose to form the thermodynamically favoured &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; cerric macrocyclic complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Pevzner, E. Maimon, Y. Ben&#8208;Eliyahu, P. Moisy, A. Bettelheim, I. Zilbermann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201868).

         <title>The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith Reaction: History, Strategies, and Synthetic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical ring rearrangements (RRR): The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals, is an important strategy in organic synthesis to rapidly access medium&#8208;sized rings that are present in several natural products and valuable pharmaceutical compounds. This Review article discusses the origin and advancement of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction with particular focus on its application to complex natural products synthesis.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;expansion strategies are valuable synthetic tools that take benefit of existing ring structures and evade the unfavorable enthalpic&#8208;and entropic effects that arise with end&#8208;to&#8208;end cyclizations. One potentially important class of such reactions is the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, the ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals. The exciting advancement in this research area is starting to show its potential, as demonstrated by applying this methodology in strategy&#8208;level bond formation to synthesize complex natural products. This Review aims to provide the first comprehensive survey of the development of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction spanning three decades from the initial report to the present day, thus providing the readers with great detail about the contributions of this reaction to organic synthesis. We hope that this review will further disclose the salient features of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction for synthetic applications and encourage the development of new, more advanced applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 61, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most straightforward and efficient strategies for preparing useful alkynyl&#8208;containing compounds and so has made great progress in recent years. This review comprehensively summarized the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes. For more information, see the Review by J. Huang and Z.&#8208;M. Chen (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201519).







Abstract
Given alkynyl group is an important functional unit, a variety of efficient methods have been developed to construct alkynyl&#8208;containing compounds. Among them, the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most straightforward and efficient strategies for preparing these compounds and so has made great progress in recent years, including the catalytic asymmetric manner. However, there is no comprehensive review to summarize these studies. This review is aimed at comprehensively summarizing the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes, which is presented in terms of alkynylation&#8208;initiated and alkynylation&#8208;terminated difunctionalizations of alkenes. We hope that this review will help to encourage more researchers to further explore in this field.

         <title>Acridone&#8208;Based Host Materials for Green Phosphorescent and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent OLEDs with Low&#8208;Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining carbazole and acridone units through pyridyl bridge, a bipolar host with highly twisted and rigid structure is developed, which guarantees the green phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs to exhibit remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
By linking the carbazole unit to the nitrogen atom of acridone through phenyl or pyridyl, two compounds, named 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz) and 10&#8208;(5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz) were designed and synthesized. These two materials, characterized with highly twisted and rigid structure, good thermal stability, and balanced carrier&#8208;transporting properties, were employed as host materials for green phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The carbazole group, despite its small contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these two materials, plays an essential role as an intramolecular host in energy delivering and improving the hole transporting ability of these two hosts. The incorporation of the electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl group as a linking group slightly improves the electron transporting capability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz. The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V, a maximum power efficiency and an external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext) of 89.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and 25.2&#8201;%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge&#8208;balancing ability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz host due to the presence of the pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness due to the suppressed non&#8208;radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, the AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz&#8208;hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 1.6&#8201;% from the maximum next at a high brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a roll&#8208;off of 15.9&#8201;% at an extremely high brightness of 10000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study manifests that acridone&#8208;based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC-Py-Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn-on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V, a maximum power efficiency and an external quantum efficiency (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;) of 89.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 25.2&#8201;%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge-balancing ability of AC-Py-Cz host due to the presence of the pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll-off at high brightness due to the suppressed non-radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, the AC-Py-Cz-hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll-off of 1.6&#8201;% from the maximum next at a high brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a roll-off of 15.9&#8201;% at an extremely high brightness of 10000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study manifests that acridone-based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll-off.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemically Enhanced Emission by Introducing Rational Photoactive Subunits into an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy was proposed by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve photochemical fluorescence enhancement behavior, which provides a valuable design principle for photoconvertable fluorophores by controllably regulating photophysical processes and photochemical reactions of AIEgens.







Abstract
Herein, we propose a rational design strategy by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups into an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve highly efficient photochemistry&#8208;activated fluorescence enhancement from dominantly photo&#8208;physical aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, and prove that such photoactivated fluorescence enhancement is perfectly suited for superstable photocontrollable dual&#8208;mode patterning applications in both solution and solid matrix. It is found that the photoactivated fluorescence of designed AIEgen is attributed to the irreversible cyclized&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation, and the oxidation product has a brighter fluorescence in both solution and solid states owning to its rigid and planar structure. The overall transformation rate of the AIEgen from its opened form to dehydrogenated form is up to nearly 100&#8201;% in a short period of UV irradiation, and the fast transformation and the stable product of this photochemical reaction guarantees super stability of photocontrolled patterning, which can be applied in photoactivated dual&#8208;mode patterning and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Liquid Crystal Dimers Bridged with a Phosphonic Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel synthesis strategy for facile access to a huge family of liquid crystal dimers or mono&#8208;addition homologues characterized with phosphonic group, which is readily achieved with P&#8722;C bonding through addition reaction between P&#8722;H and non&#8208;conjugated vinyl group. The introduced phosphonic group enables homeotropic alignment and further functionalization and one of the LC dimers exhibits NTB phase directly from the isotropic state.







Abstract
Liquid crystal (LC) dimers with well&#8208;defined composition and structure arouse broad attentions for their exhibiting LC properties beyond conventional low molar mass mesogens and serving as fascinating model compounds for LC polymers. Here in this work, a series of LC dimers bridged with a phosphonic group have been synthesized through a facile free radical mediated addition reaction between hypophosphorous acid and vinyl terminated cyanobiphenyl mesogens with variant length alkyl spacers. In addition, two esterified derivatives and a group of mono&#8208;addition homologues with a terminal phosphonic acid group have also been prepared for comparison study. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit monotropic nematic (N) phase with typical schlieren textures except for the LC dimer with the longest eleven&#8208;methylene spacer, which surprisingly shows twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTB) phase directly from the isotropic state upon cooling. Moreover, the thermal transition properties such as the nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and associated entropy changes of the series LC dimers display a modest odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, both the LC dimers and the mono&#8208;addition homologues in N phase are quite easy to achieve homeotropic alignment upon annealing thanks to the supramolecular interactions between the introduced phosphonic acid group and the hydroxylated glass surface. This work thus provides a novel synthesis strategy for a class of LC materials bridged with a phosphonic acid group prone to further functionalization, which may serve as promising vertical alignment agents and pave the way for developing a new kind of functionalized LC materials of NTB phase.

         <title>Direct Aroylation of Olefins through a Cobalt/Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative and Dehydrogenative Coupling with &#945;&#8722;Oxo Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoredox/cobalt dual catalytic procedure has been developed that allows benzoylation of olefins. Here the photoredox catalyst effects decarboxylation of &#945;&#8722;ketoacids to form benzoyl radicals. After addition of this radical to styrenes, the co&#8208;balt catalyst abstracts an H&#8208;atom. Hydrogen evolution from the putative cobalt hydride intermediate allows a Heck&#8208;like aroylation without the need for stoichiometric oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that electronically different styrenes lead to a curved Hammett plot, suggesting a change in product&#8208;determining step in the catalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Self&#8208;Catalyzed Growth of Manganese Embedded 3D Flakes&#8208;Coated Carbon Rod as an Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst of Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate for the first time the in&#8208;situ self&#8208;catalyzed growth of manganese embedded 3D flakes&#8208;coated carbon rod (GFC) as an efficient ORR catalyst of Zinc&#8211;air batteries. By optimizing the amount of Mn in the precursor, we synthesize a series of 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods. GFC with a doping amount of Mn of 10% (GFC&#8208;10) exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with an onset potential of 0.94 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The Zinc&#8211;air battery is constructed with GFC&#8208;10 as the cathode catalyst, and it exhibits a peak power density of 128.9 mW cm&#8208;2 and a cycling stability of 75 h at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2, which are superior to the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C&#8208;based Zinc&#8211;air battery. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn facilitates the self&#8208;catalyzed growth of carbon rods, and the change of Mn amount can effectively regulate the morphology of materials. The improved ORR performance of the catalyst is ascribed to the synergistic effect of unique hierarchical porous structure, high charge transport capacity, abundant carbon defects/edges and Mn&#8208;Nx sites. This research provides a new avenue to fabricating highly active Mn&#8208;based electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophile&#8208;Promoted Nucleophilic Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylindoles to Give 4&#8208;Substituted Oxazinoindolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolone derivatives by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed. This protocol was applied to a series of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles containing different substituents. The reaction conditions also tolerated a variety of diorganyl diselenides having both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. However, the reaction did not work for diorganyl disulfides and ditellurides. The reaction mechanism seems to proceed via an ionic pathway and the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides is crucial for successful cyclization.&#160; We also found that using the same starting materials, by simply changing the electrophilic source to iodine, led to the formation of 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;oxazinoindolones. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8208;Se and Csp2&#8208;I bonds were tested under cross&#8208;coupling conditions leading to the preparation of a new class of functionalized indole derivatives. In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential C&#8211;H methylation Catalyzed by the B12&#8208;dependent SAM Enzyme TokK: Comprehensive Theoretical Study of Selectivities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TokK is a B  12  &#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic asparenomycin A. It can catalyze three methylations on different sp  3  &#8208;hybridized carbon positions to introduce an isopropyl side chain at the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of pantetheinylated carbapenem. Herein, we report a quantum chemical study of the reaction mechanism of TokK. A stepwise &#8216;&#8216;push&#8211;pull&#8217;&#8217; radical relay mechanism is proposed for each methylation: 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate in the active site, then methylcobalamin directionally donates a methyl group to the substrate. More importantly, the calculations are able to uncover the origin of observed chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity for the first methylation and regioselectivity for the following two methylations. Further detailed distortion/interaction analysis can help to unravel the main factors controlling the selectivities. Our findings of sequential methylations by TokK may have profound implications for studying other B  12  &#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Chloride Corrosion by Controlling the Morphologies of PtNi Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A solvothermal method to prepare PtNi alloys that have differing morphologies is described. By adjusting the feed ratio of Pt and Ni precursors in this process, PtNi alloys with different compositions (Pt:Ni atomic ratio from 1:3 to 3:1) and morphologies (evolution from nanobranches to nanoparticles) are generated. The prepared Pt48Ni52 alloy, which has a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles, exhibits superior activity and durability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater compared to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst and other PtNi alloys that have different compositions and morphologies. The excellent seawater HER performance of Pt48Ni52 is ascribed to its nanobranch/nanoparticle morphology that optimally facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances resistance to chloride corrosion in seawater.</dc:description>

         <title>Red shift in optical excitations on layered copper perovskites under pressure: role of the orthorhombic instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The red shift under pressure in optical transitions of layered compounds with CuCl  6  4&#8208;  units is explored through first&#8208;principles calculations and the analysis of available experimental data. The results on Cu  2+  &#8208;doped (C  2  H  5  NH  3  )  2  CdCl  4  , that is taken as a guide, show the existence of a highly anisotropic response to pressure related to a structural instability, driven by a negative force constant, that leads to an orthorhombic geometry of CuCl  6  4&#8208;  units but with a hole displaying a dominant 3z  2  &#8208;r  2  character (z being the direction perpendicular to the layer plane). As a result of such an instability, a pressure of only 3 GPa reduces by 0.21 &#197; the longest Cu  2+  &#8208;Cl  &#8208;  distance, lying in the layer plane, while leaving unmodified the two other metal&#8208;ligand distances. Owing to this fact, it is shown that the lowest  d&#8208;d  transition would experience a red shift of 0.34 eV while the first allowed charge transfer transition is also found to be red shifted but only by 0.11 eV that reasonably concurs with the experimental value. The parallel study on Jahn&#8208;Teller systems CdCl  2  :Cu  2+  and NaCl:Cu  2+  involving tetragonal elongated CuCl  6  4&#8208;  units shows that the reduction of the long axis by a pressure of 3 GPa is three times smaller than that for the layered (C  2  H  5  NH  3  )  2  CdCl  4  :Cu  2+  compound. Accordingly, the optical transitions of such systems, which involve a positive force constant, are much less sensitive to pressure than in layered compounds. The origin of the red shift under pressure undergone by the lowest  d&#8208;d  and charge transfer transitions of (C  2  H  5  NH  3  )  2  CdCl  4  :Cu  2+  is discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Metal&#8208;ion Complexation of a Biomimetic Calix[6]arene Funnel Cavity functioned with phenol or quinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the biomimetic context, many studies have evidenced the importance of the 1  rt  and 2  nd  coordination sphere of a metal ion for controlling its properties. Here, we propose to evaluate a yet poorly explored aspect, which is the nature of the cavity that surrounds the metal labile site. Three calix[6]arene&#8208;based aza&#8208;ligands are compared, that differ only by the nature of cavity walls, anisole, phenol or quinone (  L  OMe  ,  L  OH  and  L  Q  ). Monitoring ligand exchange of their Zn  II  complexes evidenced important differences in the metal ion relative affinities for nitriles, halides or carboxylates. It also showed a possible sharp kinetic control on both, metal ion binding and ligand exchange. Hence, this study supports the observations reported on biological systems, highlighting that the substitution of an amino&#8208;acid residue of the enzyme active site, at remote distance of the metal ion, can have strong impacts on metal ion lability, substrate/product exchange or selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation and Characterization of the Hg&#8208;O Diatomic Molecule: A Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercuric oxide is a well&#8208;known and stable solid, but the diatomic molecule Hg&#8208;O is very fragile and do not survive detection in the gas phase. However, laser ablation of Hg atoms from a dental amalgam target into argon or neon containing about 0.3% of 16 O 2 or of 18 O 2 during their condensation into a cryogenic matrix at 4 K allows the formation of O atoms which react on annealing to make ozone and new IR absorptions in solid argon at 521.2 cm &#8211;1 for Hg&#8208; 16 O or at 496.4 cm &#8211;1 for Hg&#8208; 18 O with the oxygen isotopic frequency ratio 521.2/496.4 = 1.0500. Solid neon gives a 529.0 cm &#8211;1 absorption with a small 7.8 blue shift. CCSD(T) calculations found 594 cm &#8211;1 for Hg 16 O and 562 cm &#8211;1 for Hg 18 O (frequency ratio = 1.0569). Such calculations usually produce harmonic frequencies that are slightly higher than the anharmonic (observed) values, which supports their relationship. These observed frequencies have the isotopic shift predicted for Hg&#8208;O and are within the range of recent high&#8208;level frequency calculations for the Hg&#8208;O molecule. Spectra for the related mercury superoxide and ozonide species are also observed for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based diol library and application in the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diol scaffolds have been utilized as highly effective catalysts and ligands in a wide range of catalytic asymmetric transformations. For scaffolds to be successful as broadly used motifs, they should be prepared cheaply through facile routes and be easily handled. Here, we describe the synthesis of a family of planar chiral diols based on a modular and robust 3 step route, which yields catalytically active diols in &gt;99% de and &gt;99% ee, with up to 7 different chiral elements. These diols have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which provides clear evidence for the likely transition state when applied in the asymmetric hetero&#8208;Diels Alder reaction. Without altering the stereochemistry of the catalyst backbone, it is possible to access both enantiomers of the product by varying the substitution of the catalyst at the &#945;&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid 18F&#8208; and 19F&#8208;Difluoromethylation via Desulfurative Fluorination of Transient N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208;Linked Dithioles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difluoromethyl group plays an important role in modern medicinal and agrochemistry. While several difluoromethylation reagents have been reported, these typically rely on difluoromethyl carbenes or anions, or target specific processes. Here we describe a conceptually unique and general process for O&#8208;H, N&#8208;H and C&#8208;H difluoromethylation that involves the formation of a transient dithiole followed by facile desulfurative fluorination using silver(I)fluoride. We also introduce the 5,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodithiole (DMBDT) function, which undergoes sufficiently rapid desulfurative fluorination to additionally support  18  F&#8208;difluoromethylation. This new process is compatible with the wide range of functional groups typically encountered in medicinal chemistry campaigns and the use of [  18  F]AgF is demonstrated in the production of  18  F&#8208;labelled derivatives of testosterone, perphenazine, and melatonin,58.0+/&#8208;2.2, 20.4+/&#8208;0.3 and 32.2+/&#8208;3.6 MBq/umol, respectively.&#160; We expect the DMBDT group and this  18  F/  19  F&#8208;difluoromethylation process will inspire and support new efforts in medicinal and agrochemistry and radiotracer production.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright Organic Mechanoluminescence and Remarkable Mechanofluorochromism from Circularly Polarized TADF Enantiomers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) luminogens with stimuli&#8208;response characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a pair of organic enantiomers,  S  &#8208;CzTA and  R  &#8208;CzTA, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, have been successfully developed by introducing chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene and carbazole to phthalimide. They present CP&#8208;TADF properties in toluene solutions, giving dissymmetric factors of 0.84&#215;10  &#8208;3  and &#8208;1.03&#215;10  &#8208;3  , respectively. In the crystalline state, both  S  &#8208;CzTA and  R  &#8208;CzTA can emit intense blue TADF and produce very bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence (ML) and remarkable mechanofluorochromism (MFC) under the stimuli of mechanical force. Single&#8208;crystal analysis and theoretical calculation results suggest that their ML activities are probably associated with their chiral and polar molecular structures and unique noncentrosymmetric molecular packing modes. Furthermore, the MFC properties of the enantiomers likely originate from the destruction of crystal structure, leading to the planarization of molecular conformation. This work may provide helpful guidance for developing new CP&#8208;TADF materials with force&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biorthogonal labelling with fluorescent small molecules is an indispensable tool for diagnostic and biomedical applications. In dye&#8208;based 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyuridine (EdU) cell proliferation assays, augmentation of the fluorescent signal entails an overall enhancement in the sensitivity and quality of the method. To this end, we established a rapid, divergent synthetic route that provides  ready&#8208;to&#8208;click  pH&#8208;insensitive rhodamine dyes exhibiting outstanding brightness. Compared to the shortest available synthesis of related high quantum&#8208;yielding rhodamines, two fewer synthetic steps are required. In a head&#8208;to&#8208;head imaging comparison involving copper(I)&#8208;catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition reactions with  in&#8208;vitro  administered EdU, our novel 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine rhodamine azide outperformed the popular 5&#8208;TAMRA&#8208;azide, making it among the best available choices when it comes to fluorescent imaging of DNA. In a further exploration of the fluorescence properties of these dyes, a set of bis&#8208;MPA dendrons carrying multiple fluorescein or rhodamine units was prepared  via  branching click chemistry. Fluorescence self&#8208;quenching of fluorescein&#8208; and rhodamine&#8208;functionalized dendrons limited the suitability of the dyes as labels in EdU&#8208;based experiments but provided novel insights into these effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the G&#8208;quadruplex and Duplex DNA Binding&#160;by Controlling the Charge of Fluorescent Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules bearing either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged moieties attached to the same aromatic structure have been investigated as binders for DNA. The novel Spiro&#8208;NMe3 containing four alkylammonium substituents interacts with G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures and shows preference for G4s over duplex by means of FRET melting and fluorescence experiments. The interaction is governed by the charged substituents of the ligands as deduced from the lower binding of the sulfonate analogue (Spiro&#8208;SO3). On the contrary, Spiro&#8208;SO3 exhibits higher binding affinity to duplex DNA structure than to G4. Both molecules show a moderate quenching of the fluorescence upon DNA binding. The confocal microscopy evaluation shows the internalization of both molecules in HeLa cells and their lysosomal accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed Bipolar Electrode Array for Optical Reporting Reaction Coupled Electrochemical Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, closed bipolar electrode (BPE) array using an electrofluorochromism (EFC) or electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction is centered on. Electrochemical signals at one pole of the closed BPE array can be transduced into the EFC or ECL signals at the opposite pole. Therefore, the current signal of a redox reaction can be easily detected and imaged by monitoring the luminescence signal. Recent developments of the closed BPE array based EFC and ECL sensing and imaging are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, we propose the challenges and opportunities for improving the spatial resolution of the closed BPE array based electrochemical imaging, and emphasize the important application of this technique to the imaging of cellular activities at single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cascade Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Substitution&#8208;Elimination Reaction for the Synthesis of Linear Conjugated Dienynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, nucleophilic substitution and elimination cascade reaction allows the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. Ionic liquids are suitable recyclable solvents for the reaction. This synthetic strategy opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
The engagement in tandem of well&#8208;known organic reactions such as the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions, enables the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. This retrosynthetic approach opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes. Furthermore, ionic liquids are suitable solvents to perform the cascade reaction and recycle the metal catalysts.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Divergent Lithiation of 2,3&#8208;Dihalopyridines: Deprotolithiation versus Halogen Dance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The divergent lithiation of 2,3&#8208;dihalopyridines is reported. Taking advantage of continuous&#8208;flow technology, either the deprotolithiation or the halogen dance is carried out. After subsequent trapping with various electrophiles, 25 examples of both regioisomers were obtained in excellent yields and selectivities. Finally, this methodology was scaled up and a promising space&#8208;time yield was obtained.







Abstract
We describe herein the first halogen dance (HD) in continuous flow on 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine by selectively trapping a (pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)lithium species that is known to undergo the halogen&#8208;dance process. In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process was extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines by using various electrophiles to afford 28 examples with yields ranging from 42 to 97&#8201;% with very short residence times. Finally, scale up of the reaction was demonstrated, affording a promising space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 4.2&#8197;kg.h&#8722;1.L&#8722;1.

         <title>A Stereodivergent Approach to the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed strategy for a highly efficient protocol for the diastereodivergent construction of gem&#8208;dibroylcyclopropanes has been established. This was accomplished via the Pd(OAc)2&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of the gem&#8208;diborylalkene &#8220;carbenophile&#8208;reactive&#8221; groups with different &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;CF3.







Abstract
We report a designed stereodivergent strategy for the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. The reaction provides a highly modular approach to prepare cyclopropane ring variants bearing gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bpin), gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bdan), and gem&#8208;(Bpin,BF3K), with outstanding levels of stereocontrol. This was achieved by diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes with &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;trifluoromethyl. The key to the success of this general protocol was the diastereoselective trifluorination reaction of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes, followed by the stereospecific interconversion of the trifluoroborate salts into the Bdan group.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist it! A light&#8208;responsive molecular design to tune the &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension of oligothiophenes has been established. The relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic properties was comprehensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. The results highlight the functionality of the proposed molecular architecture as a promising candidate for the development of novel light&#8208;responsive optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
We present a quaterthiophene and sexithiophene that can reversibly change their effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation length through photoexcitation. The reported compounds make use of light&#8208;responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker&#8208;assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350&#8197;nm light, the azobenzene undergoes trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization, thus mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformation (extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Exposure to 254&#8197;nm wavelength promotes azobenzene cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans thermal relaxation at a rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized by using steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. Finally, we tested the proposed light&#8208;responsive oligothiophenes in field&#8208;effect transistors to probe the photo&#8208;induced tuning of their electronic properties.

The reported compounds make use of light-responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker-assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350&#8197;nm light, the azobenzene undergoes &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization, thus mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformation (extended &#960;-conjugation). Exposure to 254&#8197;nm wavelength promotes azobenzene &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;-conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; thermal relaxation at a rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized by using steady-state UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and quantum-chemical modeling. Finally, we tested the proposed light-responsive oligothiophenes in field-effect transistors to probe the photo-induced tuning of their electronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Push&#8208;Pull Diphenylsulfone Derivatives towards Aggregation&#8208;Induced Narrowband Deep Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accompanying effects of restricted intramolecular rotations and intermolecular interactions in D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217; typed molecules led to successively blue&#8208;shifted wavelength and narrowed bandwidth from solution to amorphous film then to crystals, realizing deep blue TADF (&#955;=424&#8197;nm, CIE coordinate of (0.15, 0.08), &#916;EST=0.07&#8197;eV) with FWHM of 64&#8197;nm in crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD.







Abstract
Narrowband deep blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted significant attention. Herein, four asymmetrical structured TADF emitters based on diphenylsulfone (DPS) acceptor and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) donor with progressive performances were developed. The tert&#8208;butyloxy auxiliary electron&#8208;donor was adopted to restrict the intramolecular rotations and provide efficient steric hindrance. Regioisomerization by altering the substitution position of DMAC on DPS unit further enhanced the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular interactions. The accompanying effects yielded increased energy level, minimized reorganization energy, and inhibited non&#8208;radiative transitions in the crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD, which achieved narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 424&#8197;nm (FWHM=64&#8197;nm, &#934;F=33.6&#8201;%) through aggregation&#8208;induced, blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE). In addition, deep&#8208;blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on tBuO&#8208;SOmAD realized the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum peaking located at 435&#8197;nm and CIE coordination of (0.12, 0.09).

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Effective Photodynamic Therapy against Hypoxic Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was constructed, which triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis with significantly reduced dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). In addition, excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect of NBS&#8208;ER was demonstrated in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Organelle&#8208;targeted type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows great potential to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an indispensable organelle in cells with important biological functions. When the ER is damaged due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the accumulation of misfolded proteins will interfere with ER homeostasis, resulting in ER stress. Here, an ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was presented. ER targeting modification significantly reduced the dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). NBS&#8208;ER could effectively produce O2&#8722;&#8901; with near&#8208;infrared irradiation, making its phototoxicity under hypoxia close to that under normoxia. Meanwhile, the photoinduced ROS triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis. In addition, NBS&#8208;ER possessed excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take a quick look: NarJ protein structural dynamics was investigated by SDSL&#8208;EPR in the complex environment of the cell. In particular, we exploited the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein dynamics at room temperature. Moreover, we demonstrated that such studies can be performed within 15&#8197;minutes, thus preserving both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.







Abstract
One of the greatest current challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of timescales in complex environments, such as the cell. Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled to site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed while preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host, Escherichia coli. We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cell. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.

         <title>Selective and Reversible Solvent Uptake in Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks</title>

TPPM&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks (SOFs) undergo reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents and heat, respectively. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOFs, following the degree of packing coefficient.







Abstract
The dynamic behavior of supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) based on the rigid tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane (TPPM) organic tecton has been elucidated through 3D electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The SOF undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents, moving from a closed structure with isolated small voids to an expanded structure with solvated channels along the b axis. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOF, following the degree of packing coefficient. The effect of solvent uptake on TPPM solid&#8208;state fluorescence was investigated, evidencing a significant variation in the emission profile only in the presence of chloroform.

         <title>Chiral Anthranyl Trifluoromethyl Alcohols: Structures, Oxidative Dearomatization and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral diphenylanthracenes with two fluorinated alcohols have two stereogenic centers and syn/anti atropisomery. Consequently, depending on their stereochemistry, they make different Hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assemblies in the solid state, whereas in solution, they specifically react to provide different chiral dearomatized bisfluorinated ethers. The chiroptical properties of all anthranyl fluorinated molecules have been compared.







Abstract
Chiral trifluoromethyl alcohol groups were introduced at the hindered ortho positions of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracenes to investigate their effects on the physical properties and reactivity towards oxidative dearomatization. In such compact structures, the position in different quadrants and the preferred orientation of the &#8722;CH(OH)CF3 groups were determined by the relative and absolute configurations of each stereoisomer, respectively. As a consequence, the stereochemistry governs the organization of the H&#8208;bonded molecules in single crystals (homochiral dimers vs ribbon), whereas in chlorinated solvents, they all behave as discrete compounds. Concerning their reactivity, the stereospecific dearomative oxidation of these molecules leads to 9,10&#8208;bis&#8208;spiro&#8208;isobenzofuran&#8208;anthracenes, when using organic single&#8208;electron transfer oxidants. The chiroptical properties of the alcohols and the corresponding dearomatized products were compared and showed an important modulation of the intensity.

         <title>Photophysics of Anionic Bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic CuI 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes show a remarkably broad and intense absorption spectrum ranging from the UV to NIR. The excited state decay pathways of four complexes selected for their electron&#8208;withdrawing and steric properties were studied by fs transient absorption spectroscopy and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. A model&#8208;free 2D correlation approach was applied for data evaluation.







Abstract
In this paper, the photophysical behavior of four panchromatically absorbing, homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI complexes, with a systematic variation in the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the imidazolate ligand, were studied by wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Excitation at 400, 480, and 630&#8197;nm populates metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, intraligand charge transfer, and mixed&#8208;character singlet states. The pump wavelength&#8208;dependent transient absorption data were analyzed by a recently established 2D correlation approach. Data analysis revealed that all excitation conditions yield similar excited&#8208;state dynamics. Key to the excited&#8208;state relaxation is fast, sub&#8208;picosecond pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, which is accompanied by the relocalization of electron density onto a single ligand from the initially delocalized state at Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. Subsequent intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold is followed by a sub&#8208;100&#8197;ps decay to the ground state. The fast, nonradiative decay is rationalized by the low triplet&#8208;state energy as found by DFT calculations, which suggest perspective treatment at the strong coupling limit of the energy gap law.

         <title>Bromine Pentafluoride BrF5, the Formation of [BrF6]&#8722; Salts, and the Stereochemical (In)activity of the Bromine Lone Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a closer look: We present the photochemical synthesis of BrF5, its high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature crystal structures, its reactions with some alkali metal fluorides and a discussion of the free valence electron pairs on the bromine atoms of the BrF5 molecules and [BrF6]&#8722; anions by using intrinsic bond orbitals.







Abstract
BrF5 can be prepared by treating BrF3 with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400&#8197;nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, and its space group was corrected to Pnma. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF5 was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low&#8208;temperature modification in space group P21/c by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. BrF5 reacts with the alkali metal fluorides AF (A=K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V), A[BrF6] the crystal structures of which have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF6] structure type (R
, no. 148, hR24). For the species [BrF6]+, BrF5, [BrF6]&#8722;, and [IF6]&#8722;, the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of intrinsic bond orbital analysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Repairable and Flexible Polymer Network Electrolyte with Enhanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) with good flexibility was prepared by polyaddition method. SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y% could show high room temperature ionic conductivity, high lithium ion transference number, and good interfacial stability with electrode. The Li/LFP battery assembled with SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% showed high specific capacity and excellent cycle performance.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance functional polymer&#8208;based electrolytes is important for realizing next generation safe lithium metal batteries. In this study, a new type of quasi&#8208;solid polymer network electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) was prepared by combining synthesized polymer network (SIPH) containing urethane bond linked ionic liquids (ILs), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and disulfide bond moieties, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), and glyme type additive. It was found that SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% was mechanically flexible, self&#8208;healable, and showed high ionic conductivity of 2.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Also, SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% possesses a high lithium ion transference number of 0.43 and good electrochemical stability. These properties enabled the SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% electrolyte membrane to support Li/Li symmetrical cell to cycle stably during long term Li plating and stripping. The Li/SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40%/LFP showed high delivered specific capacity and good stability (166.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 106 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). Such glyme doped polymer network electrolyte provides new experimental findings for developing polymer&#8208;based electrolyte with excellent mechanical integrity and battery related properties.

         <title>Surface modification, topographic design and applications of superhydrophobic systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The superhydrophobic surface with expanded wetting behaviors, like tunable adhesion, hybrids surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching etc., have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. The construction method, mechanism and advanced applications of special superhydrophobicity are reviewed, and the hydro/superhydrophobic modification are categorized and discussed based on their surface chemistry, and topographic design. The formation and maintenance of special superhydrophobicity at the meta&#8208;stable state are examined and explored. In addition, particular attention is paid to the utilization of special wettability in various applications, such as membrane distillation, droplet&#8208;based electricity generator and anti&#8208;fogging surfaces. Finally, the challenges for practical applications and future research directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Transformation of Inorganic to Organic Carbonates: Chasing for Reaction Pathways in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical reactions are solvent&#8208;free alternatives to solution&#8208;based syntheses enabling even conventionally&#8208;impossible transformations. Their reaction pathways, however, usually remain unexplored within the heavily vibrating, dense milling vessels. Here, we showcase how the green organic solvent diethyl carbonate is synthesized mechanochemically from inorganic alkali carbonates and how the complementary combination of milling parameter studies, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction real time monitoring, and quantum chemical calculations reveal the underlying reaction pathways. With this, reaction intermediates are identified, and chemical concepts of solution&#8208;chemistry are challenged or corroborated for mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) Nanocrystal Stabilized by Small Isopolymolybdate Clusters as Reactive Core for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At near neutral to basic pH, hydrolysis induced aggregation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide is often regarded as the pitfalls of molecular iron clusters. Iron&#8208;oxide nanocrystals are encouragingly active over the molecular clusters and/or bulk oxides albeit, stabilizing such nanostructures in aqueous pH and under turnover condition remain a perdurable challenge. Herein, an Anderson&#160;[Mo7O24]6&#8208; isopolyanion, a small (0.85 nm) isolable polyoxometalate (POM) possessing only {31} atoms, has been introduced for the first time as a covalent linker to stabilize an infinitely stable and aqueous&#8208;soluble &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo7O24]6&#8208; may lead to the in&#8208;situ generation of few analogous [MoxOy]n&#8208; clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, MoxOy@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [MoxOy]n&#8208;, they are covalently linked via MoVI&#8208;&#181;2O&#8208;FeIII bridging to &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core in MoxOy@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidences. Such bonding mode is more likely as precedent from the coordination motif documented in the transition metal clusters stabilized by this POM. The &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore of MoxOy@FeO(OH) behaves as potent active center for electrochemical water oxidation with a overpotential, 263 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2, lower than that observed for bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH). Despite of some molybdenum dissolution from the POM ligands to the electrolyte, residual anionic POM fragments covalently bound to the OER active &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core of the MoxOy@FeO(OH) makes the surface predominantly ionic that results in an ordered electrical double layer to promote a better charge transport across the electrode&#8208;electrolyte junction, less likely in bulk &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH).</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Formation of New C(sp2)&#8211;S Bonds via Photoactivation of Alkylamine&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel visible light promoted production of C Aryl &#8211;S bonds through electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes of alkylamines with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)arene halides is presented. This represents the first EDA&#8208;based thiolation method not relying on &#960;&#8722;&#960; or a thiolate&#8208;anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and provides a readily access to heteroarene radicals, which can be suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives to form the corresponding versatile arylsulfides. Mechanistic investigations on the aspects of the whole process have been conducted by spectroscopic measurements, demonstrating the hypothesized EDA complex formation. Moreover, the strength of this method has been proven by a gram&#8208;scale experiment and the late stage derivatization of an anticoagulant drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Mechanism of H/D Exchange for Isobutane on H&#8208;BEA by Loading Zn Species in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;  d  10  and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of three zeolite samples (H&#8208;BEA, ZnO/H&#8208;BEA, Zn  2+  /H&#8208;BEA) were monitored with  1  H MAS NMR in situ at 343&#8211;468 K. The regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups detected on H&#8208;BEA can be rationalized in terms of the mechanism of indirect exchange, which involves protonation of the intermediate olefin and further hydride abstraction from the other alkane molecule by the formed carbenium ion. Loading of Zn species in zeolite results in decrease of the rate and increase of the activation energy of the exchange. The loaded Zn species provide the tuning effect on the reaction occurrence, changing the mechanism from the indirect one to the mechanism of the direct exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porous Polyaromatic Solid for Vapor Adsorption of Xylene with High Efficiency, Selectivity, and Reusability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new porous polyaromatic solid displays unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs under ambient conditions, such as vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, and ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers.







Abstract
Development of porous materials capable of capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene and its derivatives, with high efficiency, selectivity, and reusability is highly demanded. Here we report unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs by a new porous solid, composed of a polyaromatic capsule bearing a spherical nanocavity with subnano&#8208;sized windows. Without prior crystallization and high&#8208;temperature vacuum drying, the porous polyaromatic solid exhibits the following five features: vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers, tight VOCs storage even under high temperature and vacuum conditions, and at least 5&#8197;times reusability for xylene adsorption. The observed adsorption abilities are accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure within 1&#8197;h, which has not been demonstrated by organic/inorganic porous materials reported previously.

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from superior electrical properties, porosity, specific surface area and biocompatibility, nanomaterials show tremendous potential in promoting the power supply of microbial fuel cells. This Review provides an outline of recent progress on anode modification nanomaterials in microbial fuel cells from the viewpoint of different binding modes of bacteria and materials.







Abstract
Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.

         <title>Nonsymmetric [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] Complexes: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in the Solid State and in Nanoparticles Tuned by Ligand Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Square&#8208;planar PtII complexes with tetradentate nonsymmetric {C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;} ligands display aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the solid state and in nanoparticles formed upon mixing of their solutions in THF with water. The ability of the complexes to show AIE is determined by the steric and electronic properties of the ligands&#8217; aromatic systems.







Abstract
Five square&#8208;planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes (Pt1&#8211;Pt5) with novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands (L1&#8211;L5) were synthesized and characterized. Varying the structure of the metalating aromatic systems result in substantial changes in photophysical properties and intermolecular interaction mode of the complexes in solution and in solid state. The complexes are strongly emissive in tetrahydrofuran solution, with the band maxima ranging from 560 to 690&#8197;nm. Three of these complexes (Pt1, Pt2, Pt4) afford nanospecies upon injection of their solution into water, which show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with a strong red shift of emission bands. In the solid state, crystalline samples of these complexes demonstrate mechanochromism upon grinding with a bathochromic shift of the emission. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computational analysis of monomeric Pt1&#8211;Pt5 in solution and model dimeric emitters formed through intermolecular interaction of Pt1, Pt2, Pt4 molecules allowed assignment of observed AIE to the 3MMLCT excited states of Pt&#8208;Pt bonded aggregates of these complexes.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Accessible and Reactive Sites in Gold Nanoparticles Using Bound Bis(Diphenylphosphine) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(diphenylphosphine) ligands are used to stabilize gold nanoparticles in solution. 2&#8208;napthalenethiol titrations are used to measure the number of accessible sites on the nanoparticle surfaces. The most accessible nanoparticle has 61&#8201;% of the total gold atoms available for binding. The resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.







Abstract
While bound organic ligands provide steric protection against aggregation for metallic nanoparticles in solution, they can block a large fraction of the surface atoms which are needed for binding in catalysis and sensing applications. In this work, highly accessible Au nanoparticles ligated with bis(diphenylphosphine) molecules are synthesized and characterized in solution. Characterization is performed using high angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy, and fluorescence chemisorption experiments. These synthesized nanoparticles are accessible to a 2&#8208;napthalenethiol (2&#8208;NT) probe molecule in solution. The highest 2&#8208;NT accessibility is observed when using 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand where 61&#8201;% of the total gold atoms are accessible. It is hypothesized that increasing the rigidity of the bis(diphenylphosphine) ligand increases the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are catalytically active for resazurin reduction, and the resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.

         <title>Access to Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Stereogenic Primary Aminophosphine Sulfides under Reductive Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route to enantiomerically pure P&#8208;stereogenic primary aminophosphine sulfides by reductive C&#8722;N bond cleavage with lithium in liquid ammonia is presented. Undesirable side reactions during the cleavage can be suppressed by using aliphatic substitution patterns. Quantum chemical and spectroscopic insights into a complex of a chiral primary aminophosphine sulfide and the lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;PSSH in solution was provided.







Abstract
Stereochemically pure phosphines with phosphorus&#8208;heteroatom bonds and P&#8208;centered chirality are a promising class of functional building blocks for the design of chiral ligands and organocatalysts. A route to enantiomerically pure primary aminophosphine sulfides was opened through stereospecific reductive C&#8722;N bond cleavage of phosphorus(V) precursors by lithium in liquid ammonia. The chemoselectivity of the reaction as a function of reaction time, substrate pattern, and chiral auxiliary was investigated. In the presence of exclusively aliphatic groups bound to the phosphorus atom, all competing reductive side reactions are totally prevented. The absolute configurations of all P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their use as synthetic building blocks was demonstrated. The lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;dithiophosphoric acid proved to be a useful stereochemical probe to determine the enantiomeric purity. Insights into the coordination mode of the lithium&#8208;based chiral complex formed in solution was provided by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims were synthesized, and their photophysical and chiroptical properties were analyzed. As expected, the phosphine oxide showed a markedly enhanced circularly polarized luminescence response compared with that of the corresponding phosphine.







Abstract
Small chiral organic molecules with CD properties are in high demanded due to their potential use in promising electronic and biological applications. Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group to the corresponding phosphine oxide on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a CPL response. Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims (i.&#8201;e., the C1 position) were synthesized, and their helical structures were unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The photophysical (UV/visible and emission) and chiroptical properties of these compounds were investigated in various solvents. Despite their structural similarities, phosphine oxide showed a significantly better CPL response than phosphine, with a high dissymmetry factor for emission (|glum|=(1.3&#8211;1.9)&#215;10&#8722;3) that can be attributed to structural changes in the interior of the helicene helix.

         <title>Isolation of Homo&#8208;/Mixed&#8208;Valence Ag12, Ag29, and Ag8 Clusters Stabilized by Cyclic Alkyl(amino) Carbene&#8208;Anchored Monoanionic Phosphorus Ligand</title>

Silver stableware: We have demonstrated the first syntheses and solid&#8208;state isolation of three unprecedented silver clusters [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) by employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) generated in&#8197;situ as the stabilizing ligand from the corresponding phosphaalkene and potassium phosphinidenide, respectively.







Abstract
Silver clusters are attractive candidates for their promising optical properties, and biomedical activities. Herein, we report on the first syntheses and isolation of three homo&#8208;/mixed&#8208;valence silver nanoclusters (NCs) with Ag12Cl3, Ag29, and Ag8 cores [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) having three&#8208;/twofold symmetry, employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) as the &#960;&#8208;accepting stabilizing ligand. The average diameters of Ag NCs 1, and 2 are approximately 1.6 to 2&#8197;nm. The redox non&#8208;innocent mono&#8208;atomic phosphorus anions (P&#8722;) anchored with cAAC ligands are generated in&#8197;situ by the reaction of AgOTf with a boryl&#8208;phosphaalkene (cAAC)P&#8722;B(NiPr2)2 through cleavage of the P&#8722;B bond with the help of a triflate anion (OTf&#8722;) as a weak nucleophile. Equivalent number of the (cAAC)P&#8722; anions generated in&#8197;situ are oxidized to produce the corresponding bis&#8208;phosphinidene (cAAC)2P2 leading to the generation of Ag0 ions in solution for the formation of the unprecedented mixed&#8208;valence Ag NC 2. Complex 3 is achieved by treating potassium phosphinidenide cAACPK with AgNTf2. The ligand field and the steric hindrance of the (cAAC)P units play crucial roles in stabilizing complexes 1&#8211;3, further providing a three&#8208; (1, 2)/two&#8208; (3) fold stand. The Ag12Cl3 NC (1) with a tricationic core [AgI12Cl3] was found to be diamagnetic, and fluorescent, emitting green light at 563&#8197;nm when excited at 400&#8197;nm. In contrast, the neutral Ag29 (2) and Ag8 (3) clusters were found to be paramagnetic, and NMR silent showing characteristic EPR signals for Ag0 at room temperature.

         <title>Microporous Framework (Nb, Fe)&#8208;Silicate with Much Potential to Remove Rare&#8208;Earth Elements from Waters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles of a new small&#8208;pore metal silicate, Na2.9(Nb1.55Fe0.45)Si2O10&#8901;xH2O, have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb+ by smaller Na+ ions required stabilizing the framework via partial occupancy of the Nb5+ sites by Fe3+ ions. The material is stable up to almost 500&#8201;&#176;C. Ion exchange assays show its considerable potential to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from aqueous solutions.







Abstract
Nanoparticles of a new small&#8208;pore metal silicate formulated as Na2.9(Nb1.55Fe0.45)Si2O10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O and exhibiting the structure of previously reported Rb2(Nb2O4)(Si2O6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb+ by smaller Na+ ions was accomplished by stabilizing the framework structure via partial occupancy of the Nb5+ sites by Fe3+ ions. Exploratory ion&#8208;exchange assays evidence the considerable potential of this new silicate to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from aqueous solutions.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Nanographenes with Excellent Second Order Nonlinear Optical Properties: the Synergy of B/N and Azulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azulene, a simple polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with connected electron donor and acceptor (DA), ignites the hope to design second order nonlinear optical (NLO) molecular materials from pure nonpolar carbon nanomaterials. In the present work, by incorporating azulene between two coronenes, a butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene (&#960;&#8208;DA&#8208;&#960;) is designed. One more electron in a N atom or one less electron in a B atom with respect to a C atom can polarize charge distribution in carbon nanomaterials, and further doping of B and N in the designed butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene change the system from &#960;&#8208;DA&#8208;&#960; to D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, leading to strong NLO responses, e.g., the largest static first hyperpolarizability even reaches 173.89&#215;10&#8722;30 esu per heavy atom. The synergetic role of B, N and azulene in the nanographene is scrutinized, and such doping strategy provides an effective means for carbon&#8208;based functional materials design. The strong second order NLO responses of these butterfly&#8208;shaped carbon&#8208;based nanographenes under external fields, e.g., sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation, inspire future experimental exploration.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic CuSbSe2: A potential anode material for sodium and lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;term stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) materials have emerged as attractive anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the high intrinsic electronic conductivity, rich redox sites and unique reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of a novel bimetallic TMCs material CuSbSe2. The as&#8208;prepared anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 545.6 mA h g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 592.6 mA h g&#8722;1 for LIBs at a current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and an excellent rate capability of 425.9 mA h g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 226.0 mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 for LIBs without any common&#8208;used surface modification or carbonaceous compositing. In addition, ex situ XRD and HRTEM reveal a combined conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of LIBs and NIBs. Our findings suggest bimetallic CuSbSe2 anode could be a potential anode material for both SIBs and LIBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalysed carbene transfer reaction of diazo compounds to isocyanides is developed. The resulting ketenimines are trapped in situ with various bisnucleophiles to access a range of densely functionalized heterocycles (i.e., pyrimidinones, dihydropyrazolones, 1H&#8208;tetrazoles) in a one&#8208;pot process. The electron&#8208;rich Hieber anion ([Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722;) facilitates efficient catalytic carbene transfer from acceptor&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds to isocyanides, providing a cost&#8208;efficient and benign alternative to similar noble metal&#8208;catalysed processes. Based on DFT calculations a plausible reaction mechanism for activation of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl carbene precursor and ketenimine formation is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Syntheses of (+)&#8208;Mycaperoxides C, D, G Methyl Ester and (&#8208;)&#8208;Mycaperoxide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycaperoxides are natural endoperoxides isolated from different Mycale genus sponges, showing significant antiviral or antibacterial activities. We report herein the first total syntheses of representative congeners of this family from sclareol using a stereodivergent approach. Thus, an innovative oxidative ring expansion of cyclobutanol was used to bring the 1,2&#8208;dioxane subunit, and a Mukaiyama aldol reaction on peroxycarbenium species was utilized to install the propionic acid subunit. During the study toward (+)&#8208;mycaperoxide D methyl ester (2), the isolation of the eight possible diastereomers under their ethyl thioester form allowed us to build a pertinent database for further NMR assignment studies. Thus, we completed the total syntheses of (+)&#8208;mycaperoxides D, C, G methyl ester, and (&#8208;)&#8208;mycaperoxide B in 11 to 15 steps, confirming their original assignment.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescence Materials with Multiple Emission Colour and Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing of solid luminescent materials with unity quantum yield and tunable emission color is promising, which is still a difficult task. Herein, a straightforward heat treatment method is developed to load 3, 4, 9, 10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) into the matrix of boric acid (BA), producing powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. Our results suggest that the emission of powder originates from PTCDA, and the tunable emission color is caused by the hydrolysis of PTCDA in the alkaline environment. The near&#8208;unity quantum yield is attributed to BA matrix, which provide confinement effect to PTCDA. In addition, the powder also shows excellent thermal stability, which allows its applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes. Above results are important for the development of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials for various applications, and it also provide a clue to study the emission properties of luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general synthetic approach of substituted tetraaryl&#8208;ammonium salts has been developed and illustrated crystallographically.

Suzuki coupling of these bromides with a family of boronic acids provided a&#160;reduction&#160;to practice of this strategy for arylation. Resolution of the C  2  &#160;subset&#160;  2*   m/p  &#8208;R  &#160; led to the first examples of enantiopure spirobicarbazoliums and the assignment of their absolute configuration by comparison of computational and experimental ECD spectra. An ECD comparison with Prelog&#8217;s spirobifluorenes is provided. In the case of&#160;  2*  m  &#8208;Br  , absolute configuration was confirmed by anomalous scattering.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term, Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging of Proteins in Live Cells with Photoregulated Fluxional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational tuning of molecular properties delivered fluxional fluorophores that blink spontaneously upon photoisomerization. The compatibility of these probes with the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag enabled single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific molecular targets in live cells for exceptionally long periods of time.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can reveal nanometric details of biological samples, but its high phototoxicity hampers long&#8208;term imaging in live specimens. A significant part of this phototoxicity stems from repeated irradiations that are necessary for controlled switching of fluorophores to maintain the sparse labeling of the sample. Lower phototoxicity can be obtained using fluorophores that blink spontaneously, but controlling the density of single&#8208;molecule emitters is challenging. We recently developed photoregulated fluxional fluorophores (PFFs) that combine the benefits of spontaneously blinking dyes with photocontrol of emitter density. These dyes, however, were limited to imaging acidic organelles in live cells. Herein, we report a systematic study of PFFs that culminates in probes that are functional at physiological pH and operate at longer wavelengths than their predecessors. Moreover, these probes are compatible with HaloTag labeling, thus enabling timelapse, single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific protein targets for exceptionally long times.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrene Transfer by an FeIV&#8208;Imido Complex Generated by a Comproportionation Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIV imide of a tetracarbene macrocycle active in nitrene transfer reactions can be generated from phenyltosyliodinane (PhI=NTs) either from the FeII precursor by oxidative addition (right) or from the FeIII precursor by a comproportionation reaction (left) (AN=acetonitrile, bold horizontal bars=macrocycle).







Abstract
Nitrene transfer reactions have emerged as one of the most powerful and versatile ways to insert an amine function to various kinds of hydrocarbon substrates. However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from FeII and FeIII precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous versus ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, an FeIV tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the FeII precursor was expected by a two&#8208;electron oxidative addition, its formation from an FeIII precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the FeIII precursor, an FeIII tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an FeV tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active FeIV tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the FeIII precursor.

However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous versus ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV-visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI-MS and DFT studies, an Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; precursor was expected by a two-electron oxidative addition, its formation from an Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV-visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI-MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursor, an Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an Fe&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

C&#8722;C cleavage to arylation. Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple aliphatic ketones has been achieved via chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage involving &#946;&#8208;diketones and para&#8208;quinone monoimines that facilitates the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple ketones has been achieved by chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage of &#946;&#8208;diketones. This mild organocatalytic strategy enables the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee) with the para&#8208;quinone monoimines as aryl sources. Furthermore, oxidative catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation has also been realized with free p&#8208;aminophenols.

         <title>Influence of Achiral Phosphine Ligands on a Synergistic Organo&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the employment of synergistic amino&#8208; and palladium catalysis, an allylic alkylation is disclosed where all four stereoisomers can be accessed as the major product. Importantly, this stereodivergence has been developed to employ the aminocatalyst as the sole chiral reagent. While the aminocatalyst dictates the enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity is governed by the nature of an achiral, monodentate phosphine ligand on palladium.







Abstract
An unusual diastereodivergent stereoselective allylation reaction is presented. It consists of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of an organocatalytically generated amino isobenzofulvene, where the diastereoselectivity is controlled by the electronic properties of a monodentate, achiral ligand on palladium. One major diastereoisomer is formed using triarylphosphines substituted with neutral or electron&#8208;donating substituents of the aryl group, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents favor the other diastereoisomer. The diastereoselectivity correlates with the Taft inductive parameter of substituents on the triarylphosphine ligand on palladium. The synergistic reaction involves both a catalytic secondary amine catalyst for the indene&#8208;aldehyde activation and the monodentate phosphine ligands on palladium, affording a highly enantioselective reaction with up to 98&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Based on computational investigations, the role of the monodentate phosphine ligand on the diastereoselectivity is discussed.

         <title>Evolution of a Synthetic Strategy for Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features the use of a 1,3&#8208;dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a thirty&#8208;carbon meroterpenoid capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity along with the novel molecular architecture, this plant metabolite has remained a popular synthetic target. Herein we report a full account of our synthetic investigations that have led to the enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A, establishing its absolute stereostructure. The protecting group&#8208;free, twelve&#8208;step synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode.

         <title>Studies towards the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Dictyoxetane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone is used to prepare a key building block for the total synthesis of the marine natural product dictyoxetane in enantiopure form. A synthetic alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annelation is developed, and the reactivity and diastereoselectivity of the resulting tetrasubstituted chiral furan in cycloaddition reactions towards an appropriately functionalised carbocyclic core of dictyoxetane are explored.







Abstract
The dolabellane&#8208;type diterpene dictyoxetane represents a significant challenge to synthetic organic chemistry. Methodology directed towards the total synthesis of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;dictyoxetane is reported. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of the trans&#8208;hydrindane ring system is achieved through chemoselective deoxygenation of the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone. An alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annulation is developed for the synthesis of a 2,5&#8208;dimethyl, tetrasubstituted furan, employing a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig alcohol to alkyne cyclisation/aromatisation reaction as a key step. The (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of an oxyallyl cation with a tetrasubstituted furan is established on a cyclohexanone&#8208;derived model system, and a range of related (4+3) cycloadditions investigated on a homochiral, trans&#8208;hydrindane&#8208;fused furan, where regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity is required for the natural product synthesis. In an alternative (4+2) Diels&#8208;Alder approach, a C2&#8208;symmetric vinyl sulfoxide&#8208;based chiral ketene equivalent is used to prepare oxanorbornenes with the same oxygen bridge stereochemistry found in the 2,7&#8208;dioxatricyclo[4.2.1.03,8]nonane ring system of the natural product.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Functionalized Cyanopyridines Yield an Anolyte with an Extremely Low Reduction Potential for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanopyridines are reduced at low potentials in organic solvents and are therefore a promising class of molecules for anolytes for nonaqueous redox&#8208;flow batteries (RFBs). Quantum computations suggest that properly placed phenyl and methyl substituents shift the reduction potentials even lower than those of the parent cyanopyridines and prevent dimerization of the radical anions. The optimal molecule has a reduction potential in CH3CN of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0, the lowest reported for a RFB anolyte.







Abstract
Cyanopyridines and cyanophenylpyridines were investigated as anolytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2&#8197;V or lower vs. ferrocene+/0 (Fc+/0), but the 3&#8208;CNPy&#8901;&#8722; radical anion forms a sigma&#8208;dimer that is re&#8208;oxidized at E&#8776;&#8722;1.1&#8197;V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge&#8208;discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50&#8197;M [NBu4][PF6] shows that 2&#8208;CNPy and 4&#8208;CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyanopyridines are reduced&lt;/b&gt; at low potentials in organic solvents and are therefore a promising class of molecules for anolytes for nonaqueous redox-flow batteries (RFBs). Quantum computations suggest that properly placed phenyl and methyl substituents shift the reduction potentials even lower than those of the parent cyanopyridines and prevent dimerization of the radical anions. The optimal molecule has a reduction potential in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt;, the lowest reported for a RFB anolyte.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanopyridines and cyanophenylpyridines were investigated as anolytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2&#8197;V or lower vs. ferrocene&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt; (Fc&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt;), but the 3-CNPy&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; radical anion forms a sigma-dimer that is re-oxidized at &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;&#8722;1.1&#8197;V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge-discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50&#8197;M [NBu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] shows that 2-CNPy and 4-CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that adding a phenyl group to the cyanopyridines would, for some isomers, limit dimerization and improve the stability of the radical anions, while shifting their &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; only about +0.10&#8197;V relative to the parent cyanopyridines. Among the cyanophenylpyridines, 3-CN-6-PhPy and 3-CN-4-PhPy are the most promising as anolytes. They exhibit reversible reductions at &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;2.19 and &#8722;2.22&#8197;V vs. ferrocene&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and retain about half of their capacity after 30&#8197;bulk charge-discharge cycles. An improved version of 3-CN-6-PhPy with three methyl groups (3-cyano-4-methyl-6-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyridine) has an extremely low reduction potential of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt; (the lowest reported for a nonaqueous RFB anolyte) and loses only 0.21&#8201;% of capacity per cycle during charge-discharge cycling in acetonitrile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Core/Shell Structure P Doped MoS2@Ni3S2 Nanorods Array for High Current Density Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline and Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array with core/shell structure was prepared through successive sulfuration and phosphorization strategies, which exhibits close catalytic activity to Pt/C, the overpotential is only 290&#8197;mV at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis is the most promising strategy to generate clean energy H2, and the development of catalysts with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at high current density that can resist strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte environment is of great significance for practical industrial application. Therefore, a P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array (named P&#8208;NiMoS) was successfully synthesized through successive sulfuration and phosphorization. P&#8208;NiMoS presents a core/shell structure with a heterojunction between MoS2 (shell) and Ni3S2 (core). Furthermore, the doping of P modulates the electronic structure of the P&#8208;NiMoS; the electrons transfer from the t2g orbital of Ni element to the eg empty orbital of Mo element through the Ni&#8722;S&#8722;Mo bond at the Ni3S2 and MoS2 heterojunction, facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, P&#8208;NiMoS exhibits excellent HER activity; the overpotential is 290&#8197;mV at high current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte, which is close to Pt/C (282&#8197;mV@250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and P&#8208;NiMoS can stably evolve hydrogen for 48&#8197;h.

         <title>Two 3D Rubidium Halide Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectrics Templated by Quasi&#8208;Spherical Organic Amine 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane</title>

         <dc:description>
Two 3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid ABX3 perovskite structures constructed with [RbX6] (X=Br, I) octahedra by sharing corner or face can accommodate the large spherical organic molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane using the different cavities in their inorganic frameworks.







Abstract
The emergence of (CH3NH3)PbI3 has brought the development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) structures with ABX3 type to a higher level; however, most 3D frameworks are constructed by corner&#8208;sharing of BX6 octahedra. Herein, we substituted the spherical molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2.2.2&#8208;dabco) with 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;dabcn) as a template to react with RbX (X=Br, I) in the corresponding HX acids under the consideration of reducing the molecular symmetry. Two 3D OIHP compounds [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbI3&#8901;H2O (1) and [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbBr3 (2) crystallized in non&#8208;centrosymmetric point group mm2 before the phase transition point were isolated. Among them, the 3D inorganic framework of 1 is constructed by sharing the corner of [RbI6] octahedra, while that of 2 is constructed by sharing the corner and face of [RbBr6] octahedra to acquire large cavities to accommodate the organic amine cation [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]2+; this 3D framework type is unprecedented in the OIHPs. As expected, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit reversible phase transition, dielectric and second harmonic generation (SHG) and ferroelectric properties, in which the phase transition temperature of 2 at 374&#8197;K is much higher than compound 1 at 280&#8197;K.

         <title>Recent Status and Developments of Vacancies Modulation in the ABO3 Perovskites for Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have attracted comprehensive interest for wide range of functional applications (especially for chemical catalysis) due to their high design flexibility, controllable vacancies sites creation, abundant chemical properties, and stable crystal structure. Herein, the previous research and potential development of ABO3 through adjusting the vacancy at different sites (A&#8208;site, B&#8208;site, and O&#8208;site) to enhance catalytic performance are systematically analyzed and generalized. Briefly, the ABO3 with different vacancies sites prepared by multifarious direct and indirect methods, accompanied with the improved physical&#8208;chemical properties, endow them with distinct and intensified development of catalysis application. In addition, the impressive optimization proved by the vacancies sites adjustment over the ABO3 is studied to continuously facilitate the advance in some common catalysis reactions, further expanding to other optimized functional applications. At last, the constructive suggestions for fine regulation and analysis of vacancies sites over ABO3 are also put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Driven Programmable Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting in Metal&#8208;Organic Cages and Structural Transformations between Heterochiral and Homochiral Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When a racemic mixture of chiral building blocks self&#8208;assembles to form discrete molecular or supramolecular cages, the system can adopt either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. However, control over such chiral self&#8208;sorting is hard to achieve with a desired choice of outcome. Herein we report anion templated high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting during the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of [Pd2L4] metal&#8208;organic cages, with a racemic mixture of an axially chiral ligand. Upon varying the counter&#8208;anions, the outcome of the choice of chiral self&#8208;sorting, whether social or narcissistic, leading to kinetically favored heterochiral or thermodynamically favored homochiral cages, can be controlled through specific anion encapsulation. Non&#8208;encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.</dc:description>

Non-encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substituent Effects in Iron Porphyrin Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a future hydrogen economy, non&#8209;precious metal catalysts for the water splitting reactions are needed that can be implemented on a global scale. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) catalysts with active sites constituting a metal center with fourfold coordination of nitrogen (MN4) show promising performance, but an optimization rooted in structure&#8209;property relationships has been hampered by their low structural definition. Porphyrin model complexes are studied to transfer insights from well&#8208;defined molecules to MNC systems. This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance. We propose an HER mechanism for supported iron porphyrin complexes involving a [FeII(P&#9642;)]&#8208; radical anion intermediate, in which a porphinic nitrogen atom acts as an internal base. While this work focuses on the HER, the limited influence of a simultaneous interaction with the support and an aqueous electrolyte will likely be transferrable to other catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A designed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst was covalently anchored on a range of mesoporous and hierarchical supports, to study the influence of pore size in the benzoin condensation of furfural. The structural and spectroscopic characteristics of the anchored catalysts were investigated, also with the help of Molecular Dynamics simulations, in order to rationalize the degree of stability and recyclability of the heterogenized organocatalysts. Quantitative yields (99%) and complete recyclability was maintained after several cycles, vindicating the design rationale.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic CH&#8208;&#960; Interactions Can Override Fluorine Gauche Effects to Exert Conformational Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine gauche effects are conformational properties of 2fluoroethanes often applied in modern molecular designs. However, the physical origins of fluorine gauche effects are not well understood, with the consensus favoring the established hyperconjugation theory over an emerging electrostatic model. Using a series of model systems, we show that a shift to fluorine gauche effects can be influenced by intramolecular CH&#960; aromatic interactions, a throughspace event. Modulating the &#960;&#8208;ring (forming the aromatic interaction) with substituent groups resulted in a linear Hammett relationship, indicating the CH&#960; interaction has electrostatic features. For instance, attaching a nitro group (an electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent) to the &#960;&#8208;ring weakened the CH&#960; interaction and led to a gauche preference, whereas an anti conformer is preferred with amine as substituent. The experimental results performed using proton NMR spectroscopy are corroborated by gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations and solid&#8208;state X&#8208;ray crystallography</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Symmetrical BODIPYs via Fischer Carbene Complexes: Theoretical, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole polyfunctionalized core is obtained from Fischer alkynyl carbenes and oxazolones and used to obtain highly functionalized symmetric BODIPYs with modulating optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
A series of new symmetrical highly substituted BODIPYs 6&#8201;a&#8211;l was synthesized through a prefunctionalization approach in 35&#8201;%&#8211;89&#8201;% yields from the pyrrole core. This strategy allowed modulation of the substituents at the different positions based on the choice of Fischer's alkynyl carbenes, oxazolones and aldehydes used as precursors. The substituent variation at positions 2, 6, 3 and 5 had the greatest effect on the modulation of their photophysical properties such as absorption (&#955;abs) and emission (&#955;em) wavelengths, extinction coefficient (&#1013;), quantum yields (&#981;), Stokes shifts (&#916;&#957;), fluorescence decay, radiative (krad) and non&#8208;radiative (knr) constants and the CIE 1931 coordinates. Theoretical calculations allowed to corroborate the effect of the substituents of meso&#8208;position on the modification of the dihedral angles. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the BODIPY series presents similar redox potential behavior, being electrochemically active even in successive cycles, which suggests that transport by diffusion is the dominant process.

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Unprotected C&#8208;Acyl Manno&#8208;, Rhamno&#8208; and Lyxopyranosides</title>

         <dc:description>
Just a pinch of copper iodide promotes the reaction of manno&#8208;type glycosyl iodides with lithiated dithianes. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of unprotected manno&#8208;type C&#8208;acyl pyranosides. The crucial role of the catalyst was proven by mechanistic studies and DFT calculations, suggesting a copper&#8208;radical mechanism over a SN&#8208;type mechanism.







Abstract
Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis C&#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for C&#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected C&#8208;acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the C&#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;, l&#8208;rhamno&#8208; and d&#8208;lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies. Furthermore, the C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;glycosides were easily isomerized to give rapid access to their &#946;&#8208;anomers.

Furthermore, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-acyl &#945;-glycosides were easily isomerized to give rapid access to their &#946;-anomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitochondrial Targeting and Imaging with Small Organic Conjugated Fluorophores: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on reported small molecule fluorophores exploited as mitochondrial imaging materials is carried out, with particular focus on the synthetic approaches used for the different chemistries, the photophysical characteristics of the probes and their cell biology evaluation.







Abstract
The last decade has seen an increasingly large number of studies reporting on the development of novel small organic conjugated systems for mitochondrial imaging exploiting optical signal transduction pathways. Mitochondria are known to play a critical role in a number of key biological processes, including cellular metabolism. Importantly, irregularities on their working function are nowadays understood to be intimately linked to a range of clinical conditions, highlighting the importance of targeting mitochondria for therapeutic benefits. In this work we carry out an in&#8208;depth evaluation on the progress to date in the field to pave the way for the realization of superior alternatives to those currently existing. The manuscript is structured by commonly used chemical scaffolds and comprehensively covers key aspects factored in design strategies such as synthetic approaches as well as photophysical and biological characterization, to foster collaborative work among organic and physical chemists as well as cell biologists.

         <title>Effective Iodine Capture Behavior by a Censer&#8208;shaped Macrocycle in Vapor Phase and Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivative, CTX[P(O)Ph], was reported as an efficient iodine adsorbent here. The CTX[P(O)Ph] powder exhibited high performance in both of iodine vapor adsorption and iodine aqueous solution adsorption. More importantly, two types of iodine loading crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to reveal the adsorption mechanism.







Abstract
Iodine capture is of great significance for disposal of the hazardous radioactive iodine. CTX[P(O)Ph], one kind of censer&#8208;shaped macrocycle cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivatives, was applied as an efficient iodine adsorbent. It showed satisfactory iodine adsorption capacity in vapor phase and could be reused without obvious adsorption capacity loss. Besides, the adsorbent could also uptake iodine in water. Fortunately, two iodine loading CTX[P(O)Ph] crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to explore the mechanism of iodine adsorption. This work provides a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>

         <dc:description>
For the last 30&#8197;years, the lack of a binary phosphorus nitride containing PN6 octahedra formed a scientific chasm between carbon&#8208;group and oxygen&#8208;group nitrides, both featuring a variety of solids with XN6 units (X being a non&#8208;metal element). Now, the discovery of the &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phosphorus nitrides&#8212;formed under high pressure and both composed of the elusive PN6 octahedron&#8212;builds a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after bridge between these two groups of nitrides. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Laniel, F. Trybel, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201998).

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Ring&#8208;Opening Rearrangement of Cyclopropenes Enabled by Dichotomous Gold&#8722;Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two in One: A gold&#8208;catalyzed divergent ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes has been developed for concise synthesis of structurally important polysubstituted naphthols and furans enabled by the dichotomous gold&#8722;carbenes. The use of different gold&#8208;catalysts allows for successful tuning of gold carbene reactivity or gold carbenoid reactivity in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes affords an efficient route to either polysubstituted naphthols or aryl&#8208;substituted furans. Owing to the unique dichotomy of gold&#8722;carbenes, this protocol provides a switchable reaction selectivity between naphthols and furans enabled by the use of TFP&#8722;Au(MeCN)SbF6 (tri(2&#8208;furyl) phosphine) or PNP(AuNTf2)2 (bis(diphenylphosphino)(isopropyl) amine) as catalysts respectively. It is proposed that the gold&#8722;carbene intermediate might be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;naphthol rearrangement while the gold&#8208;carbocation is more likely to be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;furan rearrangement.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes: Strong Emitters for Molecular Polaritonics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polaritonics with Peri Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes. Functionalization with electron donating groups leads to a class of highly fluorescent dyes, containing a tetraazaperylene core, which are excellent materials in strong light&#8208;matter coupling in resonant optical microcavities. This new class of functional dyes, whose properties can be simply tuned, showed fascinating behavior in molecular polaritonics.







Abstract
The functionalization of the peri position of the bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the peri position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80&#8201;%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Nucleic Acid Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA molecules are capable of a wide range of functions. Here I provide an overview of how nucleic acids with interesting and useful properties can be identified and optimized using artificial evolution. I also describe motifs that push the limits of DNA and RNA function in various ways. These examples highlight the remarkable functional potential of nucleic acids.







Abstract
For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.

         <title>Fused Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo): Broad&#8208;Range Wavelength&#8208;Independent Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives are introduced as unique photoswitches with wavelength&#8208;independent isomeric ratios in photostationary states. The wavelength&#8208;independent photoswitching, high bistability and significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum make bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives interesting candidates for MOST applications.







Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We disclosed that the Z&#8208;E photoisomerization of the meta&#8208;bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength&#8208;independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.

         <title>Labile Base&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ions. Non&#8208;Metallic Species Capable of Activating Multiple Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe2) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.







Abstract
Several base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions (2 and 3) with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the nature of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidene ions 3&#8201;c,d stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the silylene&#8208; and sulfide&#8208;supported one (2&#8208;H and 3&#8201;a) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Moreover, HBPin adduct of 3&#8201;a (8&#8208;C) catalyzes the hydroboration of pyridine. Of particular interest, silylene&#8208;supported silyliumylidene complex 2&#8208;H is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supply Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe was synthesized with varied Fe amount to construct a piezo&#8208;Fenton system driven by ultrasound, achieving the coupling of piezoelectric processes and Fenton reactions without exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Electrons generated in the piezoelectric process takes part in hydrogen peroxide production and accelerate the Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle. The piezo&#8208;Fenton system exhibited excellent and stable hydroxyl radical generating capacity in pH&#8197;2&#8211;9 without iron leaking, and the hydroxyl radicals mainly contributed to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process.







Abstract
The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8722;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4 matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;min&#8722;1. Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0&#8764;9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.

         <title>Binding of Glycans to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein, an Open Question: NMR Data on Binding Site Localization, Affinity, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet, but not so sweet. The SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein engages in weak interactions with sialoglycans, but binding to ABO(H) blood group antigens cannot be confirmed by STD NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbation experiments show that none of the glycans interacts with the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein.







Abstract
We have used NMR experiments to explore the binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein (S&#8208;protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm the binding of sialoglycans to the S&#8208;protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S&#8208;protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S&#8208;protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916;143&#8211;145 of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein, thus supporting localization of the binding site in the N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8208;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8208;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using 1H,15N TROSY HSQC&#8208;based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, we excluded binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan&#8208;binding to the S&#8208;protein.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweet, but not so sweet&lt;/b&gt;. The SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein engages in weak interactions with sialoglycans, but binding to ABO(H) blood group antigens cannot be confirmed by STD NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbation experiments show that none of the glycans interacts with the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have used NMR experiments to explore the binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S-protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm the binding of sialoglycans to the S-protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S-protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S-protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916;143&#8211;145 of the Wuhan S-protein, thus supporting localization of the binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S-protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S-protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H,&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N TROSY HSQC-based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, we excluded binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S-protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan-binding to the S-protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A single pentagon defect in a single&#8208;layered graphene catalyst is emphasized next to a control structure (pentagon ring passivated by oxygen). The small molecules near the defect represent the reactant and intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction. Lightning around the graphene indicates how the pentagon defect was fabricated with electro&#8208;assistance and the oxygen reduction reaction was driven by electrical energy. More information on identifying the catalyst's precise active site can be found in the Research Article by F. Qiu, L. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202700).

         <title>Preorganized Polyaromatic Soft Terdentate Hosts for the Capture of [Ln(&#946;&#8208;diketonate)3] Guests in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more confidential. The hereby rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (  L1&#8208;L7  ) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic naphthyridines (  L8  &#8208;  L11  ) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [  L  k  Ln(hfac)  3  ] adducts show a drastic decrease of the Ln&#8208;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand  L1  with its preorganized counterparts  L8  and  L9  . This points to an inconveniencing and limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)  3  ] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)  3  when  L1  is replaced by the preorganized  L8  &#8208;  L9  receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [  L1  Ln(hfac)  3  ] complexes in solution.&#160; As planned, the rigid, planar and extended  p  &#8208;conjugated system found in  L8  and  L9  shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands&#160; toward lower energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Going Viral: An Investigation into the Chameleonic Behavior or Antiviral Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to adjust conformations in response to the polarity of the environment, i.e. molecular chameleonicity, is considered to be important for conferring both high aqueous solubility and high cell permeability to drugs in chemical space beyond Lipinski&#8217;s rule of 5. We determined the conformational ensembles populated by the antiviral drugs asunaprevir, simeprevir, atazanavir and daclatasvir in polar (DMSO&#8208;  d  6  ) and non&#8208;polar (chloroform) environments with NMR spectroscopy. Daclatasvir was fairly rigid, whereas the first three showed large flexibility in both environments, that translated into major differences in solvent accessible 3D polar surface area within each conformational ensemble. No significant differences in size and polar surface area were observed between the DMSO&#8208;  d  6  and chloroform ensembles of these three drugs. We propose that such flexible compounds are characterized as &#8220;partial molecular chameleons&#8221; and hypothesize that their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area contributes to their membrane permeability and oral absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study by Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine&#8208;rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high&#8208;throughput methods allowing the generation of congeneric series of G4&#8208;targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigation of their interaction with the targets. Here, we developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well&#8208;established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interaction with G4&#8208;DNA of different topologies was carefully studied by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel benign synthetic strategy towards soluble tetra( peri &#8208;naphthylene)anthracene (TPNA) decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl substituents has been established. The compound is perfectly stable under ambient conditions in air and features intense and strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands reaching to near&#8208;IR region beyond 900&#160;nm. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed four facilitated reversible redox events comprising two oxidations and two reductions. These remarkable experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical studies to identify the TPNA platform a particularly useful candidate for the development of functional near&#8208;IR fluorophores upon appropriate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific lipid interaction in complex membranes: Specific interactions with lipids are critical for proteins and drugs, however, direct structural measurements of interactions with lipids remain difficult, especially in membranes that mimic biological conditions. Here, a broadly applicable solid&#8208;state NMR approach is presented that enables to directly measure specific interactions with lipids such as cardiolipin in complex fluid membranes.







Abstract
Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labeled phospholipids, we show that we can selectively detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.

Enabling semiconducting properties in N&#8208;acenoacenes. Reducing the steric demand of N&#8208;acenoacenes tunes the solid&#8208;state packings of N&#8208;acenoacenes in favor of &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking, allowing charge transfer through the crystal lattice. The first utilization of N&#8208;acenoacenes in p&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors is reported.







Abstract
Four N&#8208;acenoacenes were synthesized and analyzed for their optoelectronic properties and solid&#8208;state packings. Two of the regioisomeric acridinoacridines are TIPS&#8208;ethynylated, whereas the other pair are Boc&#8208; and triflate substituted derivatives. The two TIPS&#8208;ethynyldiazaacenoacenes were processed into organic thin&#8208;film transistors with saturation hole mobilities reaching 2.9&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2(Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromic Behavior of Dibenzothiepin Derivatives Attached with Two Michler's Hydrol Blue Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzothiepin&#8208;based redox pair and its analogues exhibit an electrochomic behavior with drastic change in the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, thus suitable for developing new bioimaging protocols. The structural change of the central seven&#8208;membered ring was found to be the key to gain electrochemical bistability upon two&#8208;electron transfer nearly at the same potential.







Abstract
10,11&#8208;Bis[bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)methylene]dibenzo[bf]thiepin (1) and &#8208;oxepin (2) were prepared as stable yellow crystalline compounds, which are the cyclic analogues of electron&#8208;donating hexaarylbutadienes. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (12+ and 22+) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for 1/12+ and 2/22+, thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide analogue (3/32+) exhibits quite similar dynamic redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin and &#8208;oxepin unit in 12+ and 22+, whereas the thiepin&#8208;S&#8208;oxide derivative (4/42+) does not exhibit bistability due to the smaller change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.

         <title>Phomoxanthone A Targets ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new inhibitor of ATP synthase: Through photoaffinity labelling and chemoproteomics analysis it was discovered, and subsequently validated, that phomoxanthone A is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. This discovery may inspire the design of new inhibitors targeting the beta subunit of ATP synthase.







Abstract
Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s), we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#8197;&#956;M phomoxanthone&#8197;A.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards the Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotic Cadaside B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cadaside B is a novel calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotic, bearing multiple rare non&#8208;canonical amino acids and exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Synthetic studies towards cadaside B yielded a compound possessing the desired connectivity of macrocyclic scaffold, but poorly matching 1H NMR spectra and lack of bioactivity. Insights and challenges towards the total synthesis are presented.







Abstract
In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non&#8208;cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on&#8208;resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different 1H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium-dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram-positive pathogens including multi-drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non-cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on-resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution-phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Innovative Gold(I) and Silver(I) Selenourea Complexes as Anticancer Agents Targeting TrxR and Cellular Redox Homeostasis</title>

Innovative Au(I) and Ag(I) NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes exhibit a prominent anticancer effect by selectively targeting TrxR in human cancer cells, thus hampering cancer cell redox machinery and inducing apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential in&#8197;vitro, on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.

         <title>An Optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Type Coupling: Enantioretentive Access to Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling reaction was optimized. A series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without any racemization. A plausible and novel mechanism was proposed and this method is useful for preparing various C&#8722;X bonds efficiently.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation takes on a critical significance in reactions of organic synthesis, material production and pharmaceutical manufactory. Chan&#8208;Lam has proposed a useful methodology to furnish secondary arylamides under mild conditions. However, when chiral sulfinamides serve as the coupling precursors, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction is found with low efficacy. Complex side&#8208;products are generated under classic conditions. Moreover, it led to the racemization of the coupling product. In this study, an optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling conditions were proposed, which resulted in clean conversion from chiral sulfinamides and arylboronic acids to offer N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides efficiently and enantioretentively. The trans&#8208;N1,N2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was proven as the most efficient ligand. Under the optimized conditions, a series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without racemization. Furthermore, a plausible and novel mechanism was proposed. Interestingly, the method could efficiently furnish a wide variety of C&#8722;X bonds by coupling arylboronic acids with different nucleophiles.

         <title>Experimentally Calibrated Computational Prediction Enables Accurate Fine&#8208;Tuning of Near&#8208;Infrared Rhodamines for Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant barrier inhibiting multiplexed imaging in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) is the extensive trial and error associated with fine&#8208;tuning NIR dyes. In particular, the need to synthesize and experimentally evaluate dye derivatives in order to empirically identify those that can be used in multiplexing applications, requires a large investment of time. While coarse&#8208;tuning efforts benefit from computational prediction that can be used to identify target dye structures for synthetic campaigns, errors in computational prediction remain too large to accurately parse modifications aimed at fine&#8208;tuning changes in dye absorbance and emission. To address this issue, we screened different levels of theory and identified a time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) approach that can rapidly, as opposed to synthesis and experimental evaluation, estimate absorbance and emission. By calibrating these computational estimations of absorbance and emission to experimentally determined parameters for a panel of existing NIR dyes, we obtain calibration curves that can be used to accurately predict the effect of fine&#8208;tuning modifications in new dyes. We demonstrate the predictive power of this calibrated dataset using seven previously unreported dyes, obtaining mean percent errors in absorbance and emission of 2.2 and 2.8%, respectively. This approach provides a significant timesavings, relative to synthesis and evaluation of dye derivatives, and can be used to focus synthetic campaigns on the most promising dye structures. The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine&#8208;tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.</dc:description>
