         <title>Mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated Carbodiphosphoranes:&#160;Synthesis, Structure, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of organoberyllium compounds with hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane yields mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated complexes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond. The bonding situation in these compounds together with a simple carbodiphosphorane and an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene adduct was analysed with energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence as well as with quantum theory of atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules. Furthermore, the driving forces accountable for mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllation were elucidated along with the reactivity of the Be=C bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating Electron Transfer by Resizing Cyclocarbon Acceptor from C18 to C16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in synthetic methods, combined with tip&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface chemistry, have enabled the formation of numerous cyclocarbon molecules. Here, we investigate computationally the experimentally studied C16 and C18 molecules as well as their van der Waals (vdW) complexes with several typical donor and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate a remarkable electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of cyclocarbon molecules. The vdW complexes of C16 and C18 exhibit a thermodynamically favorable photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor partner to the cyclocarbons that occurs on a picosecond time scale. The lower reorganization energy of C16 compared to C18 leads to a significant acceleration of the ET reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluating Diazene to N2 Interconversion at Iron&#8208;Sulfur Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interconversion of N2H2 and N2 is probed using &#956;&#8208;N2H2 iron&#8208;sulfur complexes. An intermediate trapped at low temperature was formerly presumed to be a &#956;&#8208;N2 species, but new in&#8197;situ spectroscopic characterization shows a new assignment. Our results are used to predict requirements to observe iron&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based reversible proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) for N2 fixation.







Abstract
Biological N2 reduction occurs at sulfur&#8208;rich multiiron sites, and an interesting potential pathway is concerted double reduction/ protonation of bridging N2 through PCET. Here, we test the feasibility of using synthetic sulfur&#8208;supported diiron complexes to mimic this pathway. Oxidative proton transfer from &#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;diazene (HN=NH) is the microscopic reverse of the proposed N2 fixation pathway, revealing the energetics of the process. Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two&#8208;electron oxidation of [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2H2)] (L1=tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C as [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)]2+, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N2 complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr3)L1}(&#951;2&#8208;N2H2)]+. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature. Also, PCET from the bridging diazene is highly exergonic as a result of the high Fe3+/2+ redox potential, indicating that the reverse N2 protonation would be too endergonic to proceed. This system establishes the &#8220;ground rules&#8221; for designing reversible N2/N2H2 interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Access to N,O&#8208;Acetals from Enamides by Means of Electron&#8208;Poor Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamides can be converted into their N,O&#8208;acetals using just electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimides together with light, without the need for thiophenol as additive or strong acids as catalyst.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;acetals are found as structural motifs in natural products and are important synthetic precursors for N&#8208;acylimines as building blocks in organic synthesis for C&#8722;C&#8208;bond formation and amines. For the synthesis of N,O&#8208;acetals, an acid&#8208;, base&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic method is reported applying N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide and N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;2,5,8,11&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide as extremely electron&#8208;deficient photocatalysts. The first perylene bisimide highly selectively photocatalyzes the formation of the N,O&#8208;acetals as products in high yields, and the second and more electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide allows these reactions without thiophenol as an H&#8208;atom transfer reagent. Calculated electron density maps support this. The reaction scope comprises different substituents at the nitrogen of the enamides and different alcohols as starting material. Dehydroalanines are converted to non&#8208;natural amino acids which shows the usefulness of this method for organic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate simulation models are established and developed to investigate Fe doping profile on current collapse in GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). By controlling Fe doping profile in GaN buffer layer, current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) of GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Using computer&#8208;aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) in 0.5&#8208;&#956;m gated GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de&#8208;trapping of Fe&#8208;related traps at the gate&#8208;drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep&#8208;level acceptors would boost &#9653;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (nT) induces a relatively small &#9653;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#9653;CC of GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%.

     alt="Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN-based RF HEMTs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate simulation models are established and developed to investigate Fe doping profile on current collapse in GaN-based Radio Frequency (RF) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). By controlling Fe doping profile in GaN buffer layer, current-collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) of GaN-based RF HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current-collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) in 0.5-&#956;m gated GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de-trapping of Fe-related traps at the gate-drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep-level acceptors would boost &#9653;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (n&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) induces a relatively small &#9653;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#9653;CC of GaN-based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%. The optimized distribution of Fe doping discussed in this work helps to prepare GaN-based RF HEMTs with a limited current collapse effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Study on Auto&#8208;Catalysis and Product Inhibition: A Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction Catalysed within the Cavity of an Octanuclear Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octanuclear cubic coordination cage catalyses the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a cavity&#8208;bound guest, 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). The product 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP) remained bound within the cavity, providing both autocatalysis in the early stages and inhibition in the late stages of the reaction. A red&#8208;shift in the UV/Vis spectrum revealed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host to guest binding, this was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis.







Abstract
The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity&#8208;bound guest was studied with 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH&#8197;8.6). The rate enhancement of kcat/kuncat was determined to be 22, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto&#8208;catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red&#8208;shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red&#8208;shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4&#8208;nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH&#8197;8.6. The red&#8208;shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X&#8208;ray crystallography; and was also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution&#8208;state.

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8211;Driven Self&#8211;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymers, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures.







Abstract
With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8211;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.

         <title>Scope and Limitations of Using Microemulsions for the Covalent Patterning of Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the scope and limitations of using microemulsions (MEMs) as templates to pattern graphene covalently. This methodology is very simple and can be used to obtain functionalization in either the major (out&#8208;patterning) or the minor (in&#8208;patterning) components of the MEM.







Abstract
Patterning of graphene (functionalizing some areas while leaving others intact) is challenging, as all the C atoms in the basal plane are identical, but it is also desirable for a variety of applications, like opening a bandgap in the electronic structure of graphene. Several methods have been reported to pattern graphene, but most of them are very technologically intensive. Recently, we reported the use of microemulsions as templates to pattern graphene at the &#956;m scale. This method is very simple and in principle tunable, as emulsions of different droplet size and composition can be prepared easily. Here, we explore in detail the scope of this methodology by applying it to all the combinations of four different emulsions and three different organic reagents, and characterizing the resulting substrates exhaustively through Raman, SEM and AFM. We find that the method is general, works better when the reactive species are outside the micelles, and requires reactive species that involve short reaction times.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Containing Bis(squaraine) Dyes: Design, Synthesis and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three azulene&#8208;containing bis(squaraine) dyes were synthesized, among which BSQ1 showed distinct aggregation behaviors from the other two dimers and demonstrated excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. In nanoparticles, BSQ1 formed J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 displayed H&#8208;aggregates. In films, BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures upon thermal annealing with improved charge transport capabilities.







Abstract
The relationship among chemical structure, physicochemical property and aggregation behavior of organic functional material is an important research topic. Here, we designed and synthesized three bis(squaraine) dyes BSQ1, BSQ2 and BSQ3 through the combination of two kinds of unsymmetrical azulenyl squaraine monomers. Their physicochemical properties were investigated in both molecular and aggregate states. Generally, BSQ1 displayed different assembly behaviors from BSQ2 and BSQ3. Upon fabrication into nanoparticles, BSQ1 tend to form J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 tend to form H&#8208;aggregates in aqueous medium. When in the form of thin films, three bis(squaraine) dyes all adopted J&#8208;aggregation packing modes while only BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures as well as the improvement in the carrier mobilities upon thermal annealing. Our research highlights the discrepancy of aggregation behaviors originating from the molecular structure and surrounding circumstances, providing guidance for the molecular design and functional applications of squaraines.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of PdCuAg and CeO2 Nanowires Hybrid with Abundant Heterojunction Interface for Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing CeO2 into Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via one&#8208;pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06 A mgPd&#8208;1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introducing CeO2 into Pd-based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via one-pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06 A mgPd-1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a technique for detecting small amounts of (bio)chemical analytes has become increasingly popular in various fields. While gold and silver nanostructures have been extensively studied as SERS substrates, the availability of other types of substrates is currently expanding the applications of this spectroscopic method. Recently, researchers have begun exploring two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., graphene&#8208;like nanostructures) as substrates for SERS analysis. These materials offer unique optical properties, a well&#8208;defined structure, and the ability to modify their surface chemistry. As a contribution to advance this field, this concept article highlights the significance of understanding the chemical mechanism that underlies the experimental Raman spectra of chemisorbed molecules onto 2D materials&#8217; surfaces. Therefore, the article discusses recent advancements in fabricating substrates using 2D layered materials and the synergic effects of using their metallic composites for SERS applications. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on using Raman imaging in developing 2D materials as analytical platforms for Raman spectroscopy, an exciting emerging research area with significant potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoroethylation and Pentafluoropropylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Concept summarizes photolysis, enzymatic catalysis, and transition metal catalysis as three primary approaches to C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization by trifluoromethylcarbene and its homologues. These reactions result in selective functionalization of saturated molecules allowing access to greater chemical space which is advantageous in medicinal chemistry. However, progress thus far appears to be limited, and further methodology improvements are needed.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated substituents often enhance effectiveness, improve the stability within metabolic processes, and boost the lipophilicity of biologically active compounds. However, methods for their introduction into aliphatic carbon chains remain very limited. A potentially general route to integrate the fluorinated scaffolds into organic molecules involves insertion of fluorine&#8208;containing carbenes into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of perfluoroalkyl groups enhances the reactivity of these carbenes which should enable the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Curiously, it appears that use of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing carbenes in alkane C&#8722;H functionalization is exceedingly rare. This concept describes photolysis, enzymatic catalysis, and transition metal catalysis as three primary approaches to C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization by trifluoromethylcarbene and its homologues.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Photochemical Preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) Composite with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route from photo&#8208;energy to material and environmental application was displayed, by one&#8208;step photochemical preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) and photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue. The compositing way allows CdS particles to have close contact with oxygen atoms with negative charge characteristics, promoting the electron&#8208;hole separation and effectively enhancing the activity.







Abstract
This paper presents a one&#8208;step photochemical method for the preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) composite photocatalyst, based on the concept of simultaneous photocatalytic polymerization of organic monomers during UV&#8208;light induced formation of CdS. The preparation is carried out in an aqueous solution of Na2S2O3, CdSO4, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA), under a UV lamp. The continuously formed CdS particles with photocatalytic activity act the role of initiator to directly initiate the copolymerization of MMA and MAA, resulting in the in&#8197;situ formation of the composite and full contact of the CdS particles with the oxygen&#8208;containing groups in the polymer. Taking the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a case study, the composite exhibited significantly higher activity under simulated solar light compared to the pure CdS. By analysis on various data, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption, and especially the high electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency caused by the electrostatic interaction between photogenerated holes and carbonyl oxygen atoms with negatively charged features. Furthermore, the composite displays excellent sunlight activity and recyclability, suggesting its potential for practical applications. Such a one&#8208;step construction strategy relying only on photo&#8208;energy is green, low&#8208;cost and promising in obtaining high&#8208;performance semiconductor/polymer composite photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a one-step photochemical method for the preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA-co-MAA) composite photocatalyst, based on the concept of simultaneous photocatalytic polymerization of organic monomers during UV-light induced formation of CdS. The preparation is carried out in an aqueous solution of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CdSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA), under a UV lamp. The continuously formed CdS particles with photocatalytic activity act the role of initiator to directly initiate the copolymerization of MMA and MAA, resulting in the in&#8197;situ formation of the composite and full contact of the CdS particles with the oxygen-containing groups in the polymer. Taking the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a case study, the composite exhibited significantly higher activity under simulated solar light compared to the pure CdS. By analysis on various data, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption, and especially the high electron-hole separation efficiency caused by the electrostatic interaction between photogenerated holes and carbonyl oxygen atoms with negatively charged features. Furthermore, the composite displays excellent sunlight activity and recyclability, suggesting its potential for practical applications. Such a one-step construction strategy relying only on photo-energy is green, low-cost and promising in obtaining high-performance semiconductor/polymer composite photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Network based on Electrophilic Substitution (ES) Adduct of Furan&#8208;Triazolinedione</title>

A tailor&#8208;made homopolymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA) was synthesized and engineered to a self&#8208;healable supramolecular thermoset via electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD).







Abstract
Polymers with furan functionality have been the subject of extensive research on developing sustainable materials applying a limited number of dynamic covalent approaches. Herein, we introduce a facile, dynamic non&#8208;covalent approach to make a furan polymer readily accessible for self&#8208;healing applications based on its electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD). A tailor&#8208;made furan polymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA), considering it an initial illustrative example, was rapidly ES modified with PTAD to produce furfuryl&#8208;tagged triazolidine that subsequently associated via inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen (H&#8722;) bonding to produce a thermally reversible supramolecular polymer network under ambient conditions. The H&#8208;bonded network was experimentally quantified via ATR&#8208;IR analysis and theoretically rationalized via the density functional theory (DFT) study using smaller organic model compounds analogous to the macromolecular system. Thermoreversible feature of the H&#8208;bonded triazolidine&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer network enabled the solution reprocessing and self&#8208;healing of the polymer material.

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic&#8208;Space for the Reactivity of Metal&#8208;free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO</title>

The h&#8208;BN surface catalyzes the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in presence of dioxygen. The surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for the methane oxidation is demonstrated with numerous pathways. Distortion/interaction and orbital analysis are utilized to rationalize the activation barriers. Water plays an intriguing role in HCHO and CO formation.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal&#8208;free hexagonal&#8208;boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of h&#8208;BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms in h&#8208;BN reduce O2, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over h&#8208;BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition&#8208;metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally&#8208;mapped in&#8208;detail the surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of h&#8208;BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O2 binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths varies from ~83 to ~123&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over h&#8208;BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.

         <title>Design of Multi&#8208;Luminescent Silica&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for the Detection of Liquid Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for detection of liquid organic compounds was demonstrated using SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with a EuIII:EDTA complex and the organic dye BODIPY. The ratiometric photoluminescence detection technique was proved using toluene and 1&#8208;octanol as model compounds of crude oil. The optimal synthesis conditions gave NPs with a diameter of ~100&#8197;nm, which is suitable for transport through porous oil reservoir structures.







Abstract
Tracer testing in reservoir formations is utilised to determine residual oil saturation as part of optimum hydrocarbon production. Here, we present a novel detection method of liquid organic compounds by monodisperse SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) containing two luminophores, a EuIII:EDTA complex and a newly synthesised fluorophore based on the organic boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;moiety. The particles exhibited stable EuIII PL emission intensity with a long lifetime in aqueous dispersion. The fluorescence of the BODIPY was also preserved in the aqueous environment. The ratiometric PL detection technique was demonstrated by using toluene and 1&#8208;octanol as model compounds of crude oil. The optimal synthesis conditions were found to give NPs with a diameter of ~100&#8197;nm, which is suitable for transport through porous oil reservoir structures. The cytotoxicity of the NPs was confirmed to be very low for human lung cell and fish cell lines. These findings demonstrate the potential of the NPs to replace the hazardous chemicals used to estimate the residual oil saturation. Moreover, the ratiometric PL detection technique is anticipated to be of benefit in other fields, such as biotechnology, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring, where a reliable and safe detection of a liquid organic phase is needed.

         <title>Mn(II) Promoted Divergent&#8208;Convergent Domino Reaction Giving Dinuclear Tetrasubstituted Pyrrole Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new domino reaction sequence has been realized between chelating heteroaryl methanamine and cheap and simple Mn(II) salt, leading to 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex. The reaction process has been studied and a six&#8208;step domino sequence involving the convergent [3+2] cycloaddition between imine and alkene/alkyne which were formed divergently from starting amine has been proposed.







Abstract
Domino reaction of benzo[d]thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;methylamine (S1) has been developed in the presence of MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex 1 ([MnClP]2, P&#8722;=2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time&#8208;dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent&#8208;convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound S1 could be activated by MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine II (1&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene C (1,2&#8208;bis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene) through oxidative self&#8208;condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate [MnClP] after aromatization. Dimerization of [MnClP] produces the final product 1. Three C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;N bond are formed through this six&#8208;step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (HP: 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazole)) has been obtained from 1 and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52&#8201;%) than the reported 3,4&#8208;diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(3,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)bis(benzo[d]thiazole) (DPB) (42&#8201;%).

&lt;p&gt;Domino reaction of benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazole-2-methylamine (&lt;b&gt;S1&lt;/b&gt;) has been developed in the presence of MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;[MnClP]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;=2,3,4,5-tetrakis(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazol-2-yl)pyrrol-1-ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time-dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent-convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound &lt;b&gt;S1&lt;/b&gt; could be activated by MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt; (1-(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazol-2-yl)-N-(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazol-2-ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; (1,2-bis(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazol-2-yl)ethene) through oxidative self-condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate &lt;b&gt;[MnClP]&lt;/b&gt; after aromatization. Dimerization of &lt;b&gt;[MnClP]&lt;/b&gt; produces the final product &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Three C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;N bond are formed through this six-step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt;: 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;-(1H-pyrrole-2,3,4,5-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazole)) has been obtained from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52&#8201;%) than the reported 3,4-diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2&#8242;-(3,4-diphenyl-1H-pyrrole-2,5-diyl)bis(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazole) (&lt;b&gt;DPB&lt;/b&gt;) (42&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Superelastic, Highly Conductive Graphene Aerogel/Liquid Metal Foam and its Piezoresistive Application</title>

Because of its large specific surface area and numerous active sites, GA has been widely used in the field of electrochemistry. In this study, liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;modified graphene aerogels were fabricated and used to construct a flexible sensor for the first time. The good performance of the resulting sensor offers the potential for the practical application of flexible sensors.







Abstract
Graphene aerogel (GA) has important application potential as piezoresistive sensors due to its low density, high conductivity, high porosity, and good mechanical properties. However, the fabrication of GA&#8208;based sensors with good mechanical properties and excellent sensing performance is still challenging. Herein, liquid&#8208; metal&#8208;modified GAs (GA/LM) are proposed for the development of an excellent GA&#8208;based sensor. GA/LM with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected layered structure exhibits excellent compressive stress of 41&#8197;KPa and fast response time (&lt;20&#8197;ms). While generally flexible GA composites cannot be compressed beyond 80&#8201;% strain without plastic deformation, GA/LM demonstrates a high compressive strength of 60&#8197;kPa under a strain of 90&#8201;%. A real&#8208;time pressure sensor was fabricated based on GA/LM&#8208;2 to monitor swallowing, pulse beating, finger, wrist and knee bending, and even plantar pressure during walking. These excellent features enable potential applications in health detection.

         <title>&#948;&#8208;Bonding and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Make SrAg4Sb2 a Topological Insulator</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;metal &#948; bonding creates a band inversion in the layered phase SrAg4Sb2 which makes a topological crystalline insulator. Spin&#8208;orbit coupling splits a degenerate pair of &#948;* bands which have an avoided crossing with a &#963; band. This is a new insight into the chemical origin of topological materials.







Abstract
Bonding interactions and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the topological insulator SrAg4Sb2 are investigated using DFT with orbital projection analysis. Ag&#8722;Ag delta bonding is a key ingredient in the topological insulating state because the 
 delta antibonding band forms a band inversion with the 5&#8197;s sigma bonding band. Spin&#8208;orbit coupling is required to lift d orbital degeneracies and lower the antibonding band enough to create the band inversion. These bonding effects are enabled by a longer&#8208;than&#8208;covalent Ag&#8722;Ag distance in the crystal lattice, which might be a structural characteristic of other transition metal based topological insulators. A simplified model of the topological bands is constructed to capture the essence of the topological insulating state in a way that may be engineered in other materials.

An unprecedented access to monosubstituted cationic tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs), possessing tunable photo&#8208;physical/electrochemical properties and having structural resemblance with drug molecules, via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization following a non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol is reported.

Abstract
An unprecedented non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol has been developed to access diverse monosubstituted cationic polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs) from the readily available azolium salts and phenacyl bromides via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization. This atom&#8208;economic protocol executes a range of intermediate steps e.&#8201;g. double C&#8722;H activation, nucleophilic addition, annulation, and dehydration cum aromatization in one&#8208;pot manner under the generation of H2O as the sole byproduct. Moreover, the systematic tunability of photo&#8208;physical and electrochemical properties of these new class of cPHACs can be authenticated from the DFT calculated frontier molecular orbital energies that might be beneficial for their potential applications in optoelectronics and DNA intercalation.

Nanoflower&#8208;like high&#8208;entropy CoFeCrMoMnOx/NF spinel catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 188&#8197;mV, surpassing most multicomponent electrocatalysts reported previously due to the synergistic effect between different metal elements. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra illustrate that the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH on the high&#8208;entropy spinel surface is a crucial active species for the OER.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key anode reaction of electrolytic water. To improve the slow OER kinetics, we synthesize nanoflower&#8208;like Co&#8722;Fe&#8208;Cr&#8722;Mo&#8208;Mn high&#8208;entropy spinel (HES) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) by one&#8208;step solvothermal method, which exhibit an overpotential (&#951;10) of only 188&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, much lower than bimetallic CoFeOx/NF (233&#8197;mV), trimetallic CoFeCrOx/NF (211&#8197;mV), and tetrametallic CoFeCrMoOx/NF (200&#8197;mV). The OER overpotential decreases with the increase of the number of metals, indicating that the formation of HES has a positive effect on the improvement of electrocatalytic performance, since the synergistic effect between different metals enhances the charge transfer rate and decreases reaction barrier. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH on the HES surface is a crucial active species for the OER. This work demonstrates a simple and efficient synthesis method to prepare nanoflower&#8208;like high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for efficient OER electrocatalysis.

         <title>Crystal, Solution, and Computational Study of the Structure of Ortho&#8208;Lithium N,N&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;P,P&#8208;Diphenylphosphinothioic Amide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ortho&#8208;lithiated phosphinothioic amides have been structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy in solution for the first time. DFT studies supported the existence of monomeric lithiated compounds and provided insight into their conformational behavior and the DoLi mechanism. The ortho anion transformed into a benzo[b]phosphindole 5&#8208;sulfide via a dearomatized species characterized by NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The first crystal structure of an ortho&#8208;lithium phosphinothioic amide complexed with tetramethylethylenediamine 12 is reported. The complex consists of a spirane in which the spiro&#8208;lithium is N,N&#8208; and C,S&#8208;chelated by the diamine and organophosphorus ligands, respectively. The analogous ortho anion 14 obtained by Sn(IV)/Li transmetallation in THF has also been synthesized. Nuclear magnetic resonance study of both anions showed that they exist as monomers in solution and are involved in dynamic processes including the restricted rotation around the P&#8722;N bond. 14 is converted at room temperature by nucleophilic cyclization to the dearomatized anion 15, which evolves after a few hours to the benzophosphindole sulfide 16. Density functional theory calculations supported the aggregation state in solution and were used to explore the conformational space of anion 12, the mechanism of ortho&#8208;lithiation directed by P(X)&#8722;N (X=O, S) groups, and the mechanism of formation of 15.

         <title>Photoinduced Puffing with Large Volume Expansion and Photomechanical Motions induced by Topochemical [4+4] Reactions in Molecular Crystal Solvates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rice puffing, a phenomenon where neat rice grains turn to a fluffy voluminous and porous puffed rice when heated to a certain temperature, has been mimicked using light. Irradiation of a crystal solvate (containing a solvent in the crystal lattice)&#8216; of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule with 405&#8197;nm light results in a puffed crystal with a large volume expansion.







Abstract
In this work, we report the first example of two crystal solvates of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule (Ant) that display very distinct photo&#8208;responsive behaviour when 365 or 405&#8197;nm or visible light is illuminated. For the first time, the crystal hydrate that has water molecule in the lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8722;H2O) display fascinating puffing behavior with large volume expansion upto 50&#8201;% accompanied with surface modulation when illuminated with 405&#8197;nm light, a phenomenon very much similar to the rice or popcorn puffing by thermal treatment. Utilizing the properties of photoconverted Ant&#8722;H2O crystals, we have demonstrated their application in photoinduced enhanced liquid absorption using various liquids/solutions. The other crystal solvate having DMF in the crystal lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8722;DMF) responds to 405&#8197;nm light by bending, twisting, chopping, jumping or splitting etc. The chopping of Ant&#8722;DMF crystal was also observed under ambient/white light but at a slower rate compared to 405&#8197;nm light. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveals that the photoinduced puffing and photomechanical effects of these materials are rooted to the topochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reaction between the anthracene moieties that facilitate molecular packing change assisted by the reconfiguration of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions involving lattice trapped solvent molecules.

         <title>Constructing Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Complexes for X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>

The judicious synergy between lanthanide cations and organic ligands affords two photoluminescent and radioluminescent organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids, Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2. Owing to its lower detection limit of 4.06&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 and excellent radiation stability, Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 was fabricated into a flexible scintillation film featuring a high spatial image resolution of 7&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The photoluminescent properties of lanthanide complexes have been thoroughly investigated; however, there have been much fewer studies showcasing their potential use in ionizing radiation detection. In this work, we delve into the photo&#8208; and radio&#8208;induced luminescence of a series of lanthanide&#8208;bearing organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids and their potential as a platform for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. The judicious synergy between lanthanide cations and 2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinate (bppCOO&#8722;) ligands affords six new materials with three distinct structures. Notably, Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 display sharp fingerprint X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence (XEL), the intensities of which can be linearly correlated with the X&#8208;ray dose rates over a broad dynamic range (0.007&#8211;4.55&#8197;mGy&#8201;s&#8722;1). Moreover, the X&#8208;ray sensing efficacies of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 were evaluated, showing that Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 features a lower detection limit of 4.06&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared to 14.55&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1. Given the higher X&#8208;ray sensitivity and excellent radiation stability of Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2, we fabricated a flexible scintillator film for X&#8208;ray imaging by embedding finely ground Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer. The resulting scintillator film can be utilized for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of approximately 7&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Templated Ugi Reactions versus In&#8208;Situ Ligation Screening: Two Roads to the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The primary target in corona virus infections, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, was employed as a template for Ugi four&#8208;component reactions delivering potent inhibitors of the enzyme. However, in&#8208;situ ligation screening of Ugi products was found to be superior to protein templation, enabling the fast and efficient discovery of protease inhibitors. Best inhibitors stabilized protein dimers detectable by mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;templated fragment ligation was established as a method for the rapid identification of high affinity ligands, and multicomponent reactions (MCR) such as the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 4CR) have been efficient in the synthesis of drug candidates. Thus, the combination of both strategies should provide a powerful approach to drug discovery. Here, we investigate protein&#8208;templated Ugi 4CR quantitatively using a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme assay, HPLC&#8208;QTOF mass spectrometry (MS), and native protein MS with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease as template. Ugi reactions were analyzed in aqueous buffer at varying pH and fragment concentration. Potent inhibitors of the protease were formed in presence of the protein via Ugi 4CR together with Ugi three&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 3CR) products. Binding of inhibitors to the protease was confirmed by native MS and resulted in the dimerization of the protein target. Formation of Ugi products was, however, more efficient in the non&#8208;templated reaction, apparently due to interactions of the protein with the isocyanide and imine fragments. Consequently, in&#8208;situ ligation screening of Ugi 4CR products was identified as a superior approach to the discovery of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease inhibitors.

&lt;p&gt;The primary target in corona virus infections, SARS-CoV-2 main protease, was employed as a template for Ugi four-component reactions delivering potent inhibitors of the enzyme. However, in-situ ligation screening of Ugi products was found to be superior to protein templation, enabling the fast and efficient discovery of protease inhibitors. Best inhibitors stabilized protein dimers detectable by mass spectrometry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-templated fragment ligation was established as a method for the rapid identification of high affinity ligands, and multicomponent reactions (MCR) such as the Ugi four-component reaction (Ugi 4CR) have been efficient in the synthesis of drug candidates. Thus, the combination of both strategies should provide a powerful approach to drug discovery. Here, we investigate protein-templated Ugi 4CR quantitatively using a fluorescence-based enzyme assay, HPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry (MS), and native protein MS with SARS-CoV-2 main protease as template. Ugi reactions were analyzed in aqueous buffer at varying pH and fragment concentration. Potent inhibitors of the protease were formed in presence of the protein via Ugi 4CR together with Ugi three-component reaction (Ugi 3CR) products. Binding of inhibitors to the protease was confirmed by native MS and resulted in the dimerization of the protein target. Formation of Ugi products was, however, more efficient in the non-templated reaction, apparently due to interactions of the protein with the isocyanide and imine fragments. Consequently, in-situ ligation screening of Ugi 4CR products was identified as a superior approach to the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aptamer Clicked Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) at Au Nanoparticles as Platforms with Multiple Function[&#8224;]</title>

         <dc:description>
Table of Contents: We present a novel poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;gold nanoparticle (PFS&#8208;AuNP) system for aptamer grafting. A multi&#8208;responsive aptamer&#8208;AuNP platform is described. This platform possesses high colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments and exhibits both a redox response and the specific sensitivity of the aptamer.







Abstract
Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin&#8208;specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox&#8208;active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co&#8208;reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer&#8208;PFS&#8208;AuNP composite (aptamer&#8208;AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer&#8208;AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness are studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;dependent Photocatalytic Activity of Radical&#8208;doped Perylenediimide&#8208;based Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely rare radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based hybrid materials exhibit remarkable POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activities for the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes, which is attributed to the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* and the LUMO level of the POMs.







Abstract
Inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid materials are a kind of multiduty materials with high crystallinity and definite structures, built from functional inorganic and organic components with highly tunable photochemical properties. Perylenediimides (PDIs) are a kind of strong visible light&#8208;absorbing organic dyes with &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient planes and photochemical properties depending on their micro&#8208;environment, which provides a platform for designing tunable and efficient hybrid photocatalytic materials. Herein, four radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials, Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;SiW12O40 (1), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;SiMo12O40 (2), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;PW12O40 (3), and Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;PMo12O40 (4), were attained by slow diffusion of polyoxometalates (POMs) into acidified Cl4&#8208;PDI solutions. The obtained PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials not only exhibited prominent photochromism, but also possessed reactive organic radicals under ambient conditions. Furthermore, all hybrid materials could be easily photoreduced to their radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;), and then underwent a second photoexcitation to form energetic excited state radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;*). However, experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the formed energetic Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* showed unusual POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic efficiencies toward the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes; higher photocatalytic efficiencies were found for hybrid materials 1 (anion: SiW12O404&#8722;) and 2 (anion: SiMo12O404&#8722;) compared to 3 (anion: PW12O403&#8722;) and 4 (anion: PMo12O403&#8722;). The photocatalytic efficiencies of these hybrid materials are mainly controlled by the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* and the LUMO level of the POMs. The structure&#8208;photocatalytic activity relationships established in present work provide new research directions to both the photocatalysis and hybrid material fields, and will promote the integration of these areas to explore new materials with interesting properties.

         <title>Continuous Direct Mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling via Twin&#8208;Screw Extrusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study delves into the mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction within an extruder, elucidating the influence of parameters like temperature, catalyst position and contact time. Notably, multiple passes through the extruder yielded substantially improved reaction conversions. The research underscores the pivotal role of optimizing the interplay between catalyst contact time and energy input, offering crucial insights for industrial&#8208;scale applications of mechanochemical reactions.







Abstract
This work establishes the first direct mechanocatalytic reaction protocol within an extruder, focusing on the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Through the coating of either the extruder screws or barrel with Pd, we executed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction without the reliance on molecular catalyst compounds or powders, and solvents continuously. We identified the influence and interplay of crucial reaction parameters such as temperature, mechanical energy input, residence time, rheology, and catalyst contact time and finally obtained 36&#8201;% and 75&#8201;% of the reaction product after one and four reactor passes respectively.

Abstract
Utilization of well&#8208;defined siloxane molecules allows for the construction of functional siloxane&#8208;based nanoporous materials based on the molecular design. Herein, a novel class of siloxane&#8208;based porous materials is synthesized via cross&#8208;linking of dimethylsilyl&#8208; and dimethylvinylsilyl&#8208;functionalized cage siloxanes with double&#8208;6&#8208;ring (D6R) geometry. Compared with the conventional double&#8208;4&#8208;ring cage siloxane, this study highlights the characteristics of D6R siloxanes as building blocks, demonstrating their high surface area and chemical stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show their unique cation encapsulation ability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilization of well-defined siloxane molecules allows for the construction of functional siloxane-based nanoporous materials based on the molecular design. Herein, a novel class of siloxane-based porous materials is synthesized via cross-linking of dimethylsilyl- and dimethylvinylsilyl-functionalized cage siloxanes with double-6-ring (D6R) geometry. Compared with the conventional double-4-ring cage siloxane, this study highlights the characteristics of D6R siloxanes as building blocks, demonstrating their high surface area and chemical stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show their unique cation encapsulation ability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[2,2]Paracyclophane Bridged, Thiophene Based Macrocycles: Synthesis and Electronic Properties in Different Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) bridged, thiophene&#8208;based macrocycles were sythesisized, and their electronic properties at diffferent oxidation states were investigated. The dications are open&#8208;shell diradical dications, while the tetracations have closed&#8208;shell ground state. There is almost no through&#8208;space electronic coupling through the pCp units, and thus no global aromaticity.







Abstract
The study of through&#8208;space electronic coupling in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (1 and 2) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through&#8208;space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through&#8208;space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.

         <title>Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Therapy Induced by Pt&#8208;Coordination of Type&#8208;II Photosensitizers into Supramolecular Complexes</title>

Platinum coordination with type&#8208;II photosensitizer Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py enables type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy through exciton coupling between photosensitizer's ligands and enhanced spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC).







Abstract
Platinum supramolecular complexes based on photosensitizers have garnered great interest in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to Pt (II) centers as chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate tumor cells completely, which greatly improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. However, in comparison to precursor photosensitizer ligand, the formed platinum supramolecular complexes typically exhibit inferior outcomes in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. How to boost ROS generation in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes for enhanced PDT is an enticing yet highly challenging task. Here we report a Pt&#8208;coordination&#8208;based dimeric photosensitizer complex (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)2Pt(OTf)2. It is found that comparing with photosensitizer ligand Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py, the formed supramolecular complex exhibit redshifts of absorption wavelength as well as enhanced ROS generation efficiency. Moreover, type&#8208;I ROS generation (O2&#8901;&#8722;) is produced in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes mainly due to a reduced energy gap &#916;EST resulting from exciton coupling between two photosensitizer ligands. And type&#8208;I ROS (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generation significantly amplifies the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes. In&#8197;vitro evaluation shows excellent photochemotherapy performance of (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)2Pt(OTf)2 nanoparticles. We anticipate this work would provide a novel approach to design type&#8208;I photosensitizers for efficient PDT.

         <title>A Rational Design of Electrochemically and Photophysically Tunable Triarylamine Luminophores by Consecutive (Pseudo&#8208;)Four&#8208;Component Syntheses</title>

A single palladium catalyst catches two birds with one stone by multicomponent Suzuki and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling to give a library of redox&#8208;active triarylamine (TAA) luminophores. Redox potentials, absorption and emission energies together with (TD)DFT calculations of the electronic structure set the stage for structure&#8208;property relationships for a rational design of tunable TAAs.







Abstract
The concatenation of Suzuki coupling and two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination in sequentially palladium&#8208;catalyzed consecutive multicomponent syntheses paves a concise, convergent route to diversely functionalized para&#8208;biaryl&#8208;substituted triarylamines (p&#8208;bTAAs) from simple, readily available starting materials. An extensive library of p&#8208;bTAAs permits comprehensive investigations of their electronic properties by absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum chemical calculations, which contribute to a deep understanding of their electronic structure. The synthesized p&#8208;bTAAs exhibit tunable fluorescence from blue to yellow upon photonic excitation with quantum yields up to 98&#8201;% in solution and 92&#8201;% in the solid state. Furthermore, a pronounced bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by increasing solvent polarity indicates positive emission solvatochromism. Aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water mixtures causes the formation of intensely blue fluorescent aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry shows reversible first and second oxidations of p&#8208;bTAAs at low potentials, which are tunable by variation of the introduced para substituents. 3D Hammett plots resulting from the correlation of oxidation potentials and emission maxima with electronic substituent parameters emphasize the rational design of tailored p&#8208;bTAAs with predictable electrochemical and photophysical properties.

         <title>Analysis of the Unusual Chemical Bonds and Dipole Moments of AeF&#8722; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba): A Lesson in Covalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A careful bonding analysis of the anions AeF&#8208; shows that the fluorine anion F&#8722; is a very strong donor via charge&#8208;induced covalent interactions with alkaline earth atoms Ae, exhibiting triple bonds for Ae=Be, Mg and even quadruple bonds for the heavier atoms Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba due to their empty (n&#8208;1)d valence orbitals. The unusual dipole moments with the negative end at the Ae atom are decomposed into pairwise electron contributions that reveal the special role of the HOMO.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations of the anions AeF&#8722; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba) have been carried out using ab initio methods at the CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP level and density functional theory employing BP86 with various basis sets. The detailed bonding analyses using different charge&#8208; and energy partitioning methods show that the molecules possess three distinctively different dative bonds in the lighter species with Ae=Be, Mg and four dative bonds when Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba. The occupied 2p atomic orbitals (AOs) and to a lesser degree the occupied 2s AO of F&#8722; donate electronic charge into the vacant spx(&#963;) and p(&#960;) orbitals of Be and Mg which leads to a triple bond Ae
F&#8722;. The heavier Ae atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their vacant (n&#8208;1)d AOs as acceptor orbitals which enables them to form a second &#963; donor bond with F&#8722; that leads to quadruply bonded Ae
F&#8722; (Ae=Ca&#8722;Ba). The presentation of molecular orbitals or charge distribution using only one isodensity value may give misleading information about the overall nature of the orbital or charge distribution. Better insights are given by contour line diagrams. The ELF calculations provide monosynaptic and disynaptic basins of AeF&#8722; which nicely agree with the analysis of the occupied molecular orbitals and with the charge density difference maps. A particular feature of the covalent bonds in AeF&#8722; concerns the inductive interaction of F&#8722; with the soft valence electrons in the (n)s valence orbitals of Ae. The polarization of the (n)s2 electrons induces a (n)spx hybridized lone&#8208;pair orbital at atom Ae, which yields a large dipole moment with the negative end at Ae. The concomitant formation of a vacant (n)spx AO of atom Ae, which overlaps with the occupied 2p(&#963;) AO of F&#8722;, leads to a strong covalent &#963; bond.

The polarization of the (n)s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons induces a (n)sp&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized lone-pair orbital at atom Ae, which yields a large dipole moment with the negative end at Ae. The concomitant formation of a vacant (n)sp&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; AO of atom Ae, which overlaps with the occupied 2p(&#963;) AO of F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, leads to a strong covalent &#963; bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;based Functional Glycopolymeric Nanoparticles as Fluorescent Probes for Selective Imaging of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>

Naphthalimide&#8208;based glycopolymeric nanoparticles with dual tumor&#8208;targeting ability from glucose&#8208;segment and phenylboronic ester modification were designed and used as pH sensitive and AIEgen fluorescent probes for selective imaging of tumor cells.







Abstract
A series of functional glycopolymer nanoparticles with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motif was designed, synthesized and applied for tumor cell imaging. With the pH&#8208;sensitive and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide fluorescent probe, the presence of glucose&#8208;based glycopolymers enhanced its water&#8208;solubility and biocompatibility. Owing to the dual tumor&#8208;targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor with Contorted Hexabenzocoronene and Perylenediimide for Organic Solar Cells</title>

A conjugated molecular HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI with three&#8208;dimensional geometry is synthesized and applied as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor material in the active layer of organic solar cells.







Abstract
Although fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61/C71&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) have dominated the the photoactive acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades, they have several drawbacks such as weak absorption, limited structural tunability, prone to aggregation, and high costs of production. Constructing non&#8208;fullerene small molecules with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular geometry is one of the strategies to replace fullerenes in OSCs. In this study, a 3D molecule, contorted hexa&#8208;cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene tetra perylenediimide (HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI), was designed and synthesized. HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI shows a wide and strong light absorption in the whole UV&#8208;vis region as well as suitable energy levels as an acceptor for OSCs. More importantly, the 3D construction effectively reduced the self&#8208;aggregation of c&#8208;HBC, leading to an appropriate scale phase separation of the blend film morphology in OSCs. A preliminary power conversion efficiency of 2.70&#8201;% with a champion open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.06&#8197;V was obtained in OSCs with HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI as the acceptor, which was the highest among the previously reported OSCs based on c&#8208;HBC derivatives. The results indicated that HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI may serve as a good non&#8208;fullerene acceptor for OSCs.

         <title>Controlling Cyclic Dienamine Reactivity in Radical tert&#8208;Alkylation for Molecular Diversity to Synthesize Multicyclic Compounds Possessing a Quaternary Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective formation of the desired dienamines from &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone and their reaction with tertiary alkyl radicals generated from &#945;&#8208;bromoesters led to the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) with a quaternary carbon have been successfully synthesized. This OAC can be used as a common synthetic intermediate for fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles.







Abstract
Synthesis of diverse sterically congested molecules from a single important intermediate is one of the ideal synthetic strategies in organic synthesis. In this paper, we found that &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) possessing a quaternary carbon are a useful key intermediate to derive both congested fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles. For this purpose, we have established an efficient synthetic method to obtain OAC by tertiary alkylation of &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone derivatives using &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds as a tertiary alkyl source. The key to the success of this reaction is controlling the reactivity of the dienamine intermediate. While there have been many reports on enamine reactions, dienamine reactions have not been well studied. Herein, we report controlling reactivity of dienamines and molecular diversification from OAC.

B&#8722;N fusion induced extended conjugation and tetracoordinated boron caused twisted structure in &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis) exhibit red shifted absorption than non&#8208;fused compounds. The fused porphyrins are easier to reduce and easier to oxidize compared to compounds without B&#8722;N fusion.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design, synthesis, structure, and electrochemical study of doubly &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis). These compounds have been synthesized from A2B2 type dipyridyl Ni(II) porphyrins (Ar=Ph for 1&#8201;a; Ar=C6F5 for 2&#8201;a) via Lewis base&#8208;directed electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions. The solution state structures of these compounds have been established using 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and 19F&#8208;13C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis have revealed that 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, and 2&#8208;trans adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso&#8208;carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8722;N fused molecules are ~40&#8197;nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8722;N fusion have diminished the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although 1&#8208;trans and 1&#8208;cis, show four oxidation processes, 2&#8208;trans and 2&#8208;cis show only three oxidation processes. DFT studies have revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron has induced a twist in the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ganoderma Meroterpenoids Cochlearol B and Its Congeners Driven by Structural Similarity and Biological Homology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, driven by the high structural similarity between the homologous Ganoderma meroterpenoids cochlearol B and ganocin B, two chemically synthetic strategies were designed and investigated sequentially for the synthesis of cochlearol B from ganocin B. These strategies include intramolecular metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The aim was to reveal their potential biosynthetic conversion relationship using chemical synthesis methods. As a result, a highly efficient total synthesis of cochlearol B, cochlearol T, cochlearol F, as well as the formal total synthesis of ganocins A&#8211;B, and ganocochlearins C&#8211;D, has been achieved. Additionally, a novel synthetic approach for the synthesis of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;dibenzo[b,d]pyran and its analogues has been developed through palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type/cross&#8208;coupling cascade reactions.







Abstract
Secondary metabolites that have the same biological origin must share some relationship in their biosynthesis. Exploring this relationship has always been a significant task for synthetic biologists. However, from the perspective of synthetic chemists, it is equally important to propose, prove, or refute potential biosynthetic pathways in order to elucidate and understand the biosynthesis of homologous secondary metabolites. In this study, driven by the high structural similarity between the homologous Ganoderma meroterpenoids cochlearol B and ganocin B, two chemically synthetic strategies were designed and investigated sequentially for the synthesis of cochlearol B from ganocin B. These strategies include intramolecular metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition.

         <title>Regioselective Partial Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Tetracyclic (Hetero)aromatic Systems Using a Simple Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation is a powerful synthetic approach to biologically significant moieties. Herein, a hydrogenative, regioselective dearomatisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is described, using a simple Pd catalyst at atmospheric hydrogen pressure. Deuteration is also demonstrated and some initial mechanistic insights are revealed.







Abstract
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is a powerful synthetic approach. The abundance of starting materials and cross&#8208;coupling methodologies to access the precursors allows for highly diverse products. Subsequent selective partial reduction can alter the core structure in a manner of interest to medicinal chemists. Herein, we describe the precise, partial reduction of multicyclic heteroaromatic systems using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The approach can be extended to introduce deuterium (again at late&#8208;stage). Excellent yields can be obtained using simple reaction conditions.

Liquid metal (LM) with a low melting point is dispersed from a surface into nanodroplets by ultrasound and then blended with graphene oxide. By using a bubble template method, a new LM&#8208;modified graphene aerogel (GA/LM) was formed. LM provides more conductive paths on the surface of the graphene nanosheets. The resulting GA/LM has low density, good elasticity, and mechanical stability. It was used as a high&#8208;performance material to produce piezoresistive sensors: one example of the new avenues for applying porous materials and LM in a wide range of fields including wearable sensors, flexible electronics, and robotics. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Li, Q. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303594).

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Designable and Stabilized Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies for the construction of charge&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as well as recent advances form the focus of this review. The applications of these charge&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, and biological applications are highlighted, as well as prospects for future developments in this field.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a class of crystalline framework materials assembled by hydrogen bonds. HOFs have the advantages of high crystallinity, mild reaction conditions, good solution processability, and reproducibility. Coupled with the reversibility and flexibility of hydrogen bonds, HOFs can be assembled into a wide diversity of crystalline structures. Since the bonding energy of hydrogen bonds is lower than that of ligand and covalent bonds, the framework of HOFs is prone to collapse after desolventisation and the stability is not high, which limits the development and application of HOFs. In recent years, numerous stable and functional HOFs have been developed by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, highly interpenetrated networks, charge&#8208;assisted, ligand&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted, molecular weaving, and covalent cross&#8208;linking. Charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs introduce electrostatic attraction into HOFs to improve stability while enriching structural diversity and functionality. In this paper, we review the development, the principles of rational design and assembly of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs, and introduces the different building block construction modes of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs. Highlight the applications of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, biological applications, etc., and prospects for the diverse design of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs structures and multifunctional applications.

Since the bonding energy of hydrogen bonds is lower than that of ligand and covalent bonds, the framework of HOFs is prone to collapse after desolventisation and the stability is not high, which limits the development and application of HOFs. In recent years, numerous stable and functional HOFs have been developed by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, highly interpenetrated networks, charge-assisted, ligand-bond-assisted, molecular weaving, and covalent cross-linking. Charge-assisted ionic HOFs introduce electrostatic attraction into HOFs to improve stability while enriching structural diversity and functionality. In this paper, we review the development, the principles of rational design and assembly of charge-assisted ionic HOFs, and introduces the different building block construction modes of charge-assisted ionic HOFs. Highlight the applications of charge-assisted ionic HOFs in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, biological applications, etc., and prospects for the diverse design of charge-assisted ionic HOFs structures and multifunctional applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Research Progress in Liquid Phase Growth of GaN Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flux and ammonothermal methods are capable of the growth of large size, high quality GaN crystals, which are the main methods of liquid phase growth. The research progress of these two growth methods in terms of chemical additives and growth process is summarised, and their application prospects in industrial production are discussed.







Abstract
As a wide band gap semiconductor, gallium nitride (GaN) has high breakdown voltage, excellent structural stability and mechanical properties, giving it unique advantages in applications such as high frequency, high power, and high temperature. As a result, it has broad application prospects in optoelectronics and microelectronics. However, the lack of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;size GaN crystal substrates severely limit the improvement of electronic device performance. To solve this problem, liquid phase growth of GaN has attracted much attention because it can produce higher quality GaN crystals compared to traditional vapor phase growth methods. This review introduces two main methods of liquid phase growth of GaN: the flux method and ammonothermal method, as well as their advantages and challenges. It reviews the research history and recent advances of these two methods, including the effects of different solvents and mineralizers on the growth quality and performance of GaN crystals, as well as various technical improvements. This review aims to outline the principles, characteristics, and development trends of liquid phase growth of GaN, to provide more inspiration for future research on liquid phase growth, and to achieve further breakthroughs in its development and commercial application.

Carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) can take full advantage of sustainable power to reduce the continuously increasing carbon emissions. Recycling CO2 to produce formic acid or formate is a technologically and economically viable route to accomplish CO2 cyclic utilization. Developing efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts with high selectivity towards formate is prioritized for the industrialized applications of CO2RR electrolysis. From the previous explored CO2RR catalysts, Sn, Bi and In based materials have drawn increasing attentions due to the high selectivity towards formate. However, there are still confronted with several challenges for the practical applications of these materials. Therefore, a rational design of the catalysts for formate is urgently needed for the target of industrialized applications. In this progress report, we review the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress of CO2RR catalysts (Sn, Bi, and In based materials) for formate in recent two years. We specifically focus on Sn, Bi, and In based nanomaterials and modification strategies for formate conversion. Firstly, the fundamental mechanism of CO2RR is comprehensively discussed. Secondly, the progresses along with different optimization strategies of advanced Sn, Bi, and In based nanomaterials for enhanced CO2RR performances are presented in detail. Finally, opportunities and perspectives of the catalysts are summarized, including the catalyst design, mechanistic clarification, application of in&#8197;situ characterization techniques, as well as cell architecture optimization.

         <title>Exo&#8208;Selective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 17, March 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the uncommon exo&#8208;selectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, exploring strategies like using bulky structures, s&#8208;cis conformations, &#945;&#8208;substitutions, transient constraints, and thermodynamic equilibriums. The aim is to understand, predict, and guide the creation of new catalysts for exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, expanding the scope of synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction stands as one of the most pivotal transformations in organic chemistry. Its efficiency, marked by the formation of two carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and up to four new stereocenters in a single step, underscores its versatility and indispensability in synthesizing natural products and pharmaceuticals. The most significant stereoselectivity feature is the &#8220;endo rule&#8221;. While this rule underpins the predictability of the stereochemical outcomes, it also underscores the challenges in achieving the opposite diastereoselectivity, making the exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions often considered outliers. This review delves into recent examples of exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, shedding light on the factors inverting the intrinsic tendency. We explore the roles of steric, electrostatic, and orbital interactions, as well as thermodynamic equilibriums in influencing exo/endo selectivity. Furthermore, we illustrate strategies to manipulate these factors, employing approaches such as bulky substituents, s&#8208;cis conformations, transient structural constraints, and innovative control physics. Through these analyses, our aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to predict and design exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, paving the way for new diastereoselective catalyst systems and expanding the chemical scope of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

         <title>Designing Ionic Ir(III) Cyclometalated Complexes as Photocatalysts for Light Assisted ATRP of MMA. A Combined Experimental and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of ionic Ir(III)&#8208;complexes was designed, prepared and assessed for the visible light assisted ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA). A complete experimental and mechanistic study is performed to shed light on the key factors for the proper control of the polymerization process.







Abstract
A new family of ionic Ir(III) cyclometalated complexes with general formula [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br], was designed and prepared to be assessed as photocalysts for the visible light assisted ATRP polymerization of MMA. To this purpose, our design strategy involved both: i) the decoration of the cyclometalating (CN) and the ancillary (NN) ligands with various electron withdrawing and/or electron donor substituents and, ii) the use of Br&#8722; as the counter anion for these cationic Ir(III) species. After an extensive screening in which the [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br]&#8208;type compounds were compared to the model neutral complex fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3], the &#8220;fully&#8221; amino&#8208;substituted ion pairs abbreviated as [10][Br] and [11][Br], exhibited the best photocatalytic performances under irradiation with CFL lamps. It is worth noting that the outcomes of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments combined with theoretical DFT calculations, enlightened the role played by the Ir(III) complexes in the mechanism of the photoATRP process, and suggested the rationalization of the different performances that were highlighted by our Ir(III) catalyst in the visible light assisted photopolymerization of MMA.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Multicatalytic Cerium Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Cleavage of O&#8722;H Bearing Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach toward general &#946; C&#8722;C bond scission reactions of carboxylic acids and hemiacetals is presented. The present work demonstrates the power of a multicatalytic cerium&#8208;based photoredox platform to enable direct hydrodecarboxylation of carboxylic acids as well as redox&#8208;neutral ring cleavage of lactol derivatives.







Abstract
The need for synthetic methodologies capable of rapidly altering molecular structure are in high demand. Most existing methods to modify scaffolds rely on net exothermicity to drive the desired transformation. We sought to develop a general strategy for the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds &#946; to hydroxyl groups independent of inherent substrate strain. To this end we have applied a multicatalytic cerium photoredox&#8208;based system capable of activating O&#8722;H bonds in lactols to deliver formate esters. The same system is also capable of effecting hydrodecarboxylation and hydrodecarbonylation reactions. Initial mechanistic probes demonstrate atomic chlorine (Cl&#8901;) is generated under the reaction conditions, but substrate activation through cerium&#8208;alkoxides or &#8208;carboxylates cannot be ruled out.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Discharge Processes of Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article elucidates the significant factors affecting discharge intermediates and reaction pathways of the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries and highlights a *Li2O&#8208;mediated surface lithiation mechanism.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries facilitate renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, particularly in terms of the theoretical aspect. First, the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates are highlighted, and a surface lithiation mechanism predominantly applicable to catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption is proposed. Subsequently, the modeling of the chemical potential of Li++e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage, is detailed. Finally, challenges and future directions pertaining to the further development of Li&#8722;CO2 are discussed. In essence, this concept article seeks to inspire future experimental and theoretical studies in advancing the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method has been developed for the fabrication of gradient&#8208;structured actuators with cross&#8208;link variation by using two distinct photoinitiator systems to selectively trigger thiol&#8208;ene polymerization and acrylate homopolymerization. The gradient&#8208;structured actuator undergoes bending deformation in both air and solvent environments, and can be controlled by carefully tailoring the photopolymerization conditions.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have recently gained significant attention in the field of soft robotics, sensors, and biomimetic devices. The most facile way for the fabrication of such materials remains to endow bilayer structures which are fabricated with the combination of active and passive layers. Although, easily fabricated, these structures suffer from the generation of stress points between connection areas. In this work we develop a method to create a thin film with controlled cross&#8208;link variation across its thickness. The cross&#8208;link gradient is achieved through polymerization induced diffusion of dithiol molecules in thiol&#8208;ene network. As a result, the film exhibits bending deformation upon illumination with light or exposure to a chemical solvent, thereby demonstrating dual responsiveness. Light actuation of the film is achieved via photothermal effects due to the incorporation of dye into the system which can absorb UV light and heat the network. While solvent induced actuation is due to anisotropic swelling. Furthermore, the straightforward fabrication procedure allows for the creation of more complex deformations by patterning the film using a photomask during photopolymerization.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A density functional theory study of the ScIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation of ketones with diazo compounds unveils a novel substrate coordination mode driven by the trans influence of counterions. This sheds light on the origins of the stereoselectivity and suggests a new strategy for adjusting it. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Huang, Y.&#8208;D. Wu, and X.

         <title>Targeting of G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug development strategy: Re and 99mTc tricarbonyl complexes with a pyridostatin moiety as a G4&#8208;binding motif have been obtained through a post&#8208;conjugation strategy using Pz&#8208;COOH&#8208;M. Metalation was found to enhance the complexes&#8217; cytotoxicity in two cancer cell lines; the 99mTc congener was used to study binding and internalization. Possible uses of the complexes for DNA&#8208;interaction, cell and biodistribution studies are illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Palma, A. Paulo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400285).

         <title>Functional Plasticity of a Viral Terpene Synthase, OILTS, that Shows Non&#8208;Specific Metal Cofactor Binding and Metal&#8208;dependent Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>OILTS is a viral class I terpene synthase found from the giant virus Orpheovirus IHUMI&#8208;LCC2. It exhibits a unique structure and demonstrates high plasticity to metal cofactors, allowing it to biosynthesize different cyclic terpene frameworks. Notably, while OILTS produces only (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol with the most common cofactor, Mg2+, it also biosynthesizes a different cyclic terpene, (+)&#8208;cubebol, with Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+, presenting a rare instance of cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme catalysis. This is the first report of (+)&#8208;cubebol biosynthesis, to our knowledge. In addition, OILTS can uptake Zn2+ as a cofactor, which is uncommon among ordinary terpene synthases. These findings suggest that OILTS's functional plasticity may benefit the virus in diverse host environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Synthesis of Cobalt Polynitrides: Unveiling Intriguing Crystal Structures and Nitridation Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we conduct extensive high&#8208;pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt&#8208;nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, first&#8208;principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high&#8208;pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs&#8208;type CoN, and marcasite&#8208;type CoN2 within the pressure range of 50&#8208;90 GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co3N2, Pnma&#8208;CoN and two polynitrides, CoN3 and CoN5, within the pressure range of 90&#8208;120 GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN3 feature branched&#8208;type nitrogen trimers (N3) and CoN5 show &#960;&#8208;bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN6 polyhedral frameworks transit from face&#8208;sharing (in CoN) to edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and finally to isolated (in CoN5). Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between structure evolution, bonding arrangements, and high&#8208;pressure synthesis in polynitrides, expanding the knowledge for the development of advanced energy materials</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel photoswitchable ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Azobenz(metPA)2 (1) is used to prepare a [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 metallocycle (2), whose photoisomerization was characterized using static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. Optical studies demonstrate the highly quantitative and reproducible photoinduced cyclic E/Z switching without decay of the complex. Accordingly and best to our knowledge, [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 constitutes the first reversibly photoswitchable (3d)&#8209;metallocycle based on azobenzene. The photoinduced multiexponential dynamics in the sub&#8208;picosecond to few picosecond time domain of 1 and 2 have been assessed. These ultrafast dynamics as well as the yield of the respective photostationary state (PSSZ = 65%) resemble the behavior of archetypical azobenzene. Also, the innovative pump&#8208;probe laser technique of gas phase transient photodissociation (t&#8208;PD) in a mass spectrometric ion trap was used to determine the intrinsic relaxation dynamics for the isolated complex. These results are consistent with the results from femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) in solution, emphasizing the azobenzene&#8208;like dynamics of 2. This unique combination of fs&#8208;TA&#160; and t&#8208;PD enables valuable insights into the prevailing interplay of dynamics and solvation. Both analyses (in solution and gas phase) and quantum chemical calculations reveal a negligible effect of the metal coordination on the switching mechanism and electronic pathway, which suggests a non&#8208;cooperative isomerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing dimensionality in self&#8208;assembly. Toward two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different approaches to achieve 2D supramolecular polymers, as an alternative to the covalent bottom&#8208;up approaches reported for the preparation of 2D materials, are reviewed. The significance of the operation of weak non&#8208;covalent forces to induce a lateral growth of a number of self&#8208;assembling units is collected. The examples of both thermodynamically and kinetically controlled formation of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies (nanosheets, scrolls, porous surfaces) and showing elegant applications like chiral recognition, enantioselective uptake or asymmetric organic transformations. Furthermore, elaborated techniques like seeded or living supramolecular polymerizations have been demonstrated to give rise to complex 2D nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Spiro&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalenes: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties, Conformational Issues and Charge Transfer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within this work we have investigated spiro&#8208;based tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) obtained as mixtures of stereoisomers from racemic spiro[5.5]undeca&#8208;1,8&#8208;dien&#8208;3&#8208;one. Compared to previously described spiro&#8208;TTFs, enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric forms have been here separated by chiral HPLC and fully characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The two types of spiro&#8208;based chiral derivatives contain either one (2) or three (1) chiral centres out of each one is spiro&#8208;type. Experimental CD, supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations, shows differences in the optical activity between the 1 and 2 and their intermediates. The low optical activity of 2 and 3 (spiro alone chirality) was attributed to the presence of two conformers in the solution (ax and eq) of opposite Cotton effect whereas in the case of 1 and 5 (spiro and stereogenic centres) the spiro chirality seems to be responsible of the Cotton effect in the high energy region whereas the R and S chirality in the low energy region. Racemic and enantiopure forms have been successfully used for the synthesis of charge transfer complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) based acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferromagnetically coupled chromium(III) dimer shows luminescence and sensitizes photon upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There has been much progress on mononuclear chromium(III) complexes featuring luminescence and photoredox activity, but dinuclear chromium(III) complexes have remained underexplored in these contexts until now. We identified a tridentate chelate ligand able to accommodate both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III), to either access a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex depending on reaction conditions. This chelate ligand causes tetragonally distorted primary coordination spheres around chromium(III) in both complexes, entailing comparatively short excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the range of 400 to 800 ns in solution at room temperature and making photoluminescence essentially oxygen insensitive. The two chromium(III) ions in the dimer experience ferromagnetic exchange interactions that result in a high spin (S = 3) ground state with a coupling constant of +9.3 cm&#8208;1. Photoinduced energy transfer from the luminescent ferromagnetically coupled dimer to an anthracene derivative results in sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion. Based on these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies, dinuclear chromium(III) complexes seem attractive for the development of fundamentally new types of photophysics and photochemistry enabled by magnetic exchange interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary sites of the C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like fold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;type lectins are a large superfamily of proteins involved in a multitude of biological processes. In particular, their involvement in immunity and homeostasis has rendered them attractive targets for diverse therapeutic interventions. They share a characteristic C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain whose adaptability enables them to bind a broad spectrum of ligands beyond the originally defined canonical Ca2+&#8208;dependent carbohydrate binding. Together with variable domain architecture and high&#8208;level conformational plasticity, this enables C&#8208;type lectins to meet diverse functional demands. Secondary sites provide another layer of regulation and are often intricately linked to functional diversity. Located remote from the canonical primary binding site, secondary sites can accommodate ligands with other physicochemical properties and alter protein dynamics, thus enhancing selectivity and enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the biological response. In this review, we outline the structural determinants allowing C&#8208;type lectins to perform a large variety of tasks and to accommodate the ligands associated with it. Using the six well&#8208;characterized Ca2+&#8208;dependent and Ca2+&#8208;independent C&#8208;type lectin receptors DC&#8208;SIGN, langerin, MGL, dectin&#8208;1, CLEC&#8208;2 and NKG2D as examples, we focus on the characteristics of non&#8208;canonical interactions and secondary sites and their potential use in drug discovery endeavors.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Cellular Uptake with Unnatural Amino Acid for Inhibiting Immunosuppressive Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting immunosuppressive metastatic cancer cells is a key challenge in therapy. We recently have shown that a rigid&#8208;rod aromatic, pBP&#8208;NBD, that responds to enzymes and kill immunosuppressive metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells in mimetic bone microenvironment. However, pBP&#8208;NBD demonstrated moderate efficacy against CRPC cells. To enhance activity, we incorporated the unnatural amino acid L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;biphenylalanine (L&#8208; or D&#8208;BiP) into pBP&#8208;NBD, drastically increasing cellular uptake and CRPC inhibition. Specifically, we inserted BiP into pBP&#8208;NBD to target mOS (Saos2 and SJSA1) and CRPC (VCaP and PC3) cells with overexpressed phosphatases. Our results show that the D&#8208;peptide backbone with an aspartate methyl diester at the C&#8208;terminal offers the highest activity against these immunosuppressive mOS and CRPC cells. Importantly, imaging shows that the peptide assemblies almost instantly enter the cells and accumulate primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum of Saos2, SJSA1, and PC3 cells and at the lysosomes of VCaP cells. By using BiP to boost cellular uptake and self&#8208;assembly within cancer cells, this work illustrates an unnatural hydrophobic amino acid as a versatile and effective residue to boost endocytosis of synthetic peptides for intracellular self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acids to Their Cyclic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intramolecular electrochemical dehydration reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. This electrolysis allows dicarboxylic acids as naturally abundant, inexpensive, safe, and readily available starting materials to be transformed into carboxylic anhydrides under mild reaction conditions. No conventional dehydration reagent is required. The obtained cyclic anhydrides are highly valuable reagents in organic synthesis, and in this report, we use them in&#8208;situ for acylation reactions of amines to synthesize amides. This work is part of the recent progress in electrochemical dehydration, which &#8211; in contrast to electrochemical dehydrogenative reactions for example &#8211; is an underexplored field of research. The reaction mechanism was investigated by 18O isotope labelling, revealing the formation of sulfate by electrochemical oxidation and hydrolysis of the thiocyanate supporting electrolyte. This transformation is not a classical Kolbe&#8208;electrolysis, because it is non&#8208;decarboxylative, and all carbon atoms of the carboxylic acid starting material are contained in the carboxylic anhydride. In total, 20 examples are shown with NMR yields up to 71%.</dc:description>

         <title>The Utilization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives Composite in Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Up to now, the mainstream adoption of renewable energy has brought about substantial transformations in the electricity and energy sector. This shift has garnered considerable attention within the scientific community. Supercapacitors, known for their exceptional performance metrics like good charge/discharge capability, strong power density, as well as extended cycle longevity, have gained widespread traction across various sectors, including transportation and aviation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique traits including adaptable structure, highly customizable synthetic methods, and high specific surface area, have emerged as strong candidates for electrode materials. For enhancing the performance, MOFs are commonly compounded with other conducting materials to increase capacitance. This paper provides a detailed analysis of various common preparation strategies and characteristics of MOFs. It summarizes the recent application of MOFs and their derivatives as supercapacitor electrodes alongside other carbon materials, metal compounds, and conductive polymers. Additionally, the challenges encountered by MOFs in the realm of supercapacitor applications are thoroughly discussed. Compared to previous reviews, the content of this paper is more comprehensive, offering readers a deeper understanding of the diverse applications of MOFs. Furthermore, it provides valuable suggestions and guidance for future progress and development in the field of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic N2&#160;Reduction to NH3 by Enhancing N2 Activation via Interaction between Au Nanoparticles and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted much attention as a sustainable ammonia production technology, but it needs further exploration due to its slow kinetics and the existence of competitive side reactions. In this research, xAu/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) catalysts were obtained by loading gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto MIL&#8208;101(Fe) using a one&#8208;step reduction strategy. Herein, MIL&#8208;101(Fe), with high specific surface area and strong N2 adsorption capacity, is used as a support to disperse Au NPs to increase the electrochemical active surface area. Au NPs, with a high NRR activity, is introduced as the active site to promote charge transfer and intermediate formation rates. More importantly, the strong interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the electron transfer between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe), thereby enhancing the activation of N2 and achieving efficient NRR. Among the prepared catalysts, 15%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) has the highest NH3 yield of 46.37 &#956;g h&#8208;1mg&#8208;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 39.38 % at &#8208;0.4 V (vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ FTIR reveals that the NRR mechanism of 15%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) follows the binding alternating pathway and also indicates that the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) strengthens the activation of the N&#8801;N bond in the rate&#8208;limiting process, thereby accelerating the NRR process.</dc:description>

         <title>N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Sulfurdiimides are Strongly Redox Tuned</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 4&#8208; and 2,4,6&#8208;substituted diaryl sulfur diimides induce a large dependence on redox properties, such as the one&#8208;electron reduction CV waves shown here, that correlate linearly with the redox MO energies. One&#8208;electron transfers are confirmed using in&#8197;situ EPR spectroscopy, identifying radical anions that have longer lifetimes the more electron withdrawing the substituents.







Abstract
The synthesis and extensive characterization of nine aryl sulfur diimides (SDIs, Ar&#8722;NSN&#8722;Ar) are presented with a robust computational and experimental investigation of the fundamental properties of these important members of the thiazyl family of compounds, with particular attention paid to their highly tunable electrochemical behaviour. This is the first work to undertake a systematic comparison of the electrochemical profiles of a coherent series of SDIs to demonstrate and quantify the response of their reduction potentials to substituent electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing properties. This effect is found to be not only exceptionally strong, but also correlates very closely with computed orbital energies. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to determine the nature, localization, and qualitative lifetimes of the radical anions of SDIs. This work also addresses significant misconceptions about physical properties of SDIs. Experimental data and modern computational methods are employed to provide a resolute answer to the long&#8208;standing contention of the solution&#8208;state conformations of SDIs, and to correct historical mistakes in the assignment of infrared spectroscopic data. High&#8208;quality crystal structures of all SDIs in this work showcase the utility of the recently introduced structural refinement software NoSpherA2, enabling full anisotropic refinement of H&#8208;atoms with accurate C&#8722;H bond lengths.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Self&#8208;Supported Ge Anode for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode with enlarged surface area, enough spacing, and the shortened ions/electrons transporting path length would greatly facilitate the rapid kinetics and promote more Li ions reversibly stored in the Ge electrode during cycling, thus embrace improved energy&amp;power density and cyclability. This review highlights various strategies of constructing the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode and provides future perspectives.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high&#8208;performance binder&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shortened ions/electrons transporting distance of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode would be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge&#8208;based electrodes in energy storage systems.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional (3D) self-supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high-performance binder-free lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shortened ions/electrons transporting distance of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self-supported Ge electrode would be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self-supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self-supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge-based electrodes in energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimodal use of chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers: study of the position impact towards the helical screw&#8208;sense preference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of a chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine residue into Aib oligomers proved its effectiveness as a bimodal moiety, acting both as controller and 19F NMR reporter of the helical screw&#8208;sense preference. By varying its position along the chain and the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping, our study revealed the stereoelectronic properties of the CF3 group enabling the control of the helical conformation.







Abstract
Oligomers of the achiral &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) adopt a 310 helical conformation in which the screw&#8208;sense preference can be controlled by a single chiral residue. The use of the fluorinated residue &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw&#8208;sense preference of such oligomers acting as 19F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw&#8208;sense preference of poly&#8208;Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (N&#8208;terminal, central or C&#8208;terminal) as well as the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &#945;&#8208;TfmAla as a helical screw&#8208;sense controller.

         <title>Intramolecular Phenyl Transfer from a Boronate to Lithium in the Gas Phase Reveals Crucial Role of Solvation in Transmetalations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to common belief, transmetalation reactions are not simply controlled by the electronegativity difference of the involved metals/metalloids. A combination of gas&#8208;phase and solution experiments, together with quantum chemical calculations, reveals the crucial role of solvation in the transmetalation from lithium to boron. Only in the presence of solvent molecules, the reaction proceeds in the expected direction, whereas the formation of the organolithium compound is favored in the gas phase.







Abstract
In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; (pin=pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids. Instead, the individual coordination states and their changes over the course of the reaction must be taken into account.

         <title>Designing Powerful Biindole&#8208;Based Inherently Chiral Selectors: Enhancing Enantiodiscrimination by Core Functionalization with Additional Coordination Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a further coordination element to biindole&#8208;based inherent chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, by exploiting their peculiar advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms in the atropisomeric core, can powerfully enhance their remarkable enantiodiscrimination performances, as shown by tests with both model ferrocenyl and NSAIDs chiral probes.







Abstract
Among inherently chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, usually resulting in very good enantiodiscrimination performances, the biindole&#8208;based family has the additional advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms with a variety of substituents with desirable properties. Aiming to evaluate the possibility of exploiting such feature to enhance the enantiodiscrimination ability of the archetype structure, a series of three inherently chiral monomers were designed and synthesized, characterised by a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric core conjugated to bithiophene wings enabling fast and regular electrooligomerization, and functionalised at the nitrogen atoms with an ethyl, a methoxyethyl, or a hydroxyethyl substituent. Nitrogen alkylation was also exploited to obtain for the first time the chemical resolution of the biindole selectors without employing chiral HPLC. The enantiodiscrimination ability of the selector series was comparatively evaluated in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept chiral voltammetry experiments with a &#8220;benchmark&#8221; chiral ferrocenyl probe as well as with chiral non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs naproxen and ketoprofen. The large enantiomer potential differences for all probes increased in the ethyl &lt; methoxyethyl &#8810; hydroxyethyl sequence of selector substituents, supporting our assumption on the beneficial role of an additional coordination element. The powerful hydroxyethyl selector was also applied to ketoprofen in a commercial drug matrix.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Nano&#8208;Reservoir for Room Temperature RNA Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been studied for room&#8208;temperature storage of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs). The RNAs loaded in COFs maintained their structural integrity when stored in ambient conditions for weeks and were found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation in the presence of RNase.







Abstract
The emerging role of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as therapeutics is alluring. However, RNAs are extremely labile under ambient conditions and typically need to be stored in cryogenic conditions (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Hence, storage, stabilization, and transportation of RNA under ambient conditions have been an arduous task and remain an unsolved problem. In this work, a guanidinium&#8208;based ionic covalent organic framework (COF), TTGCl with nanotubular morphology, was synthesized and used as nano&#8208;reservoirs for room&#8208;temperature storage of RNA. To understand the role of the nanotubular morphology and chemical nature of TTGCl in stabilizing the RNA structure and for comparison purposes, a neutral COF, TMT&#8208;TT, is synthesized and studied. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed non&#8208;covalent interaction between the COFs and the RNA nucleobases, facilitating reversible storage of RNA. RNA loaded in COFs was found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation when treated with RNase. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the structural integrity of the recovered RNAs and their further processibility.

         <title>Remote Fluorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls via Silyl Dienol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general, regioselective, and metal free &#947;&#8208;fluorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls via silyl dienol ethers that are readily prepared from simple ketones and aldehydes. The transformation displays broad scope including 27 cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes providing &#947;&#8208;fluoro compounds in 28&#8211;91&#8201;% yield. Notably, the reported conditions are also suitable for the synthesis of challenging tertiary fluorides. The regioselectivity of the reaction was studied on a series of acyclic siloxydienes and was observed to be sensitive to the conformational flexibility of the substrate. Diversification of the &#947;&#8208;fluorocarbonyls demonstrates the promise of fluorine as a stereocontrol element.

     alt="Remote Fluorination of &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Carbonyls via Silyl Dienol Ethers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a general, regioselective, and metal free &#947;-fluorination of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyls via silyl dienol ethers that are readily prepared from simple ketones and aldehydes. The transformation displays broad scope including 27 cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes providing &#947;-fluoro compounds in 28&#8211;91&#8201;% yield. Notably, the reported conditions are also suitable for the synthesis of challenging tertiary fluorides. The regioselectivity of the reaction was studied on a series of acyclic siloxydienes and was observed to be sensitive to the conformational flexibility of the substrate. Diversification of the &#947;-fluorocarbonyls demonstrates the promise of fluorine as a stereocontrol element.

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of perfect polar dipole alignment in ferroelectric lattices of organic non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) materials demonstrates the potential for crystal engineering by rational design to craft materials with advanced optical performance. The methoxyphenyl series of acetophenone azines feature polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). These third&#8208;generation chromophores feature superior triple T&#8208;contacts and improved crystal growth, and they excel because of their enhanced NLO properties.







Abstract
An improved design is described for ferroelectric crystals and implemented with the &#8220;methoxyphenyl series&#8221; of acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines with Y=F (1), Cl (2), Br (3), or I (4). The crystal structures of these azines exhibit polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). Azines 1, 3, and 4 form true racemates whereas chloroazine 2 crystallizes as a kryptoracemate. Azines 1&#8211;4 are helical because of the N&#8722;N bond conformation. In true racemates the molecules of opposite helicity (M and P) are enantiomers A(M) and A*(P) while in kryptoracemates they are diastereomers A(M) and B*(P). The stacking mode of PBAMs is influenced by halogen bonding, with 2&#8211;4 showcasing a kink due to directional interlayer halogen bonding, whereas fluoroazine 1 demonstrates ideal polar stacking by avoiding it. Notably, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines display a stronger bias for dipole parallel alignment, attributed to the linearity of the biphenyl moiety as compared to the phenoxy series of (PhO, Y)&#8208;azines with their non&#8208;linear Ph&#8722;O&#8722;Ph moiety. The crystals of 1&#8211;4 all feature planar biphenyls and this synthon facilitates their crystallization through potent triple T&#8208;contacts and enhances their nonlinear optical (NLO) performance by increasing conjugation length and affecting favorable chromophore conformations in the solids.

         <title>Phenanthrothiophene&#8208;Triazine Star&#8208;Shaped Discotic Liquid Crystals: Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazine&#8208;based mesogens with three pending discoid arms have been shown to self&#8208;organize into rectangular columnar mesophases and form gels in various solvents. The solvatochromic&#8208;, acidochromic&#8208; and metal recognition&#8208;response photoluminescence of these mesogens offer applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting and as selective metal&#8208;ion recognition.







Abstract
Lipophilic biphenylthiophene&#8208; and phenanthrothiophene&#8208;triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn, respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent's polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON&#8208;OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self&#8208;assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0&#8197;mg/mL). Therefore, these star&#8208;shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.

A facile and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component reaction has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminonaphthothiazoles from 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes, elemental sulfur, and amines. This photochemical transformation can be conducted under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst to afford various naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines in moderate to excellent yields by using air as a green oxidant.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy has been explored for the synthesis of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines through ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H sulfuration of 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes with elemental sulfur and amines under external photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component reaction, which utilizes elemental sulfur as the odorless sulfur source, molecular oxygen as the clean oxidant, and visible light as the clean energy source, provides a mild and efficient approach to construct a series of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photoexcitation of reaction intermediates consisting of thioureas and DBU might be involved in this transformation.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships for Potential Inversion from Electron Acceptors Based on Thiophene&#8208;Fused Triptycene Quinones, 1,4&#8208;Diketones and their Malononitrile Adducts</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and properties of a series of 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane (TCAQ) inspired electron acceptors based on thiophene&#8208;fused quinone and triptycene motifs is presented. This has yielded insights into structure&#8208;property relationships for establishing and modulating simultaneous two electron reduction processes in TCAQ analogues. These new compounds were synthesised using a Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation between triptycene and thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarbonyl chloride. Isomeric para&#8208;quinones featuring a [c]&#8208;fused thiophene on one side and a &#946;,&#946;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;fused triptycene on the other were isolated alongside a thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;diketone which bears two triptycene fragments. Knoevenagel condensation of these products with malononitrile produced a quinoidal bis(dicyanomethylene), an oxo&#8208;dicyanomethylene and an acyclic bis(dicyanomethylene). This series of new electron accepting molecules has been studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography and the implications of their 3D structures on NMR and UV/vis absorbance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results have been ascertained with conclusions underpinned by computational methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Revision of a Natural Tetrasaccharide from Starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starfish provide important saponins with diverse bioactivities as the secondary metabolites, among which 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides are commonly found. Preparation of those 1,2&#8208;trans 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides usually relies on 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation requiring the selective installation and cleavage of 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl groups. A convergent synthesis using 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated oligosaccharide donors would be more straightforward but also pose greater challenges. Herein, we report a convergent synthesis of a distinctive tetrasaccharide isolated from starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell. Dual 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) groups at O3 and O4 on galactose moiety led to high &#946;&#8208;selectivities (&#946;/&#945; = 12/1 or &#946; only) in the challenging [2 + 2] glycosylation, giving the desired tetrasaccharides in &gt;90% yields from the 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated disaccharide donors. These synthetic studies have also unambiguously revised the structure of these natural tetrasaccharides. This work would facilitate further studies on new inhibitors of &#945;&#8208;glucosidase as hypoglycemic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Push&#8208;pull Bis&#8208;norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair represents a promising system for application in molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). Often, the NBD derivatives have very limited overlap with the solar spectrum, and substitution to redshift the absorption leads to a decrease in the gravimetric energy density. Dimeric systems mitigate this factor because two switches can &#8216;share&#8217; a substituent. Here, we present five new NBD dimers with red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. One dimer features the most red&#8208;shifted absorption onsets (539 nm) and a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption maximum (404 nm) for NBD systems reported so far, without compromising thermal half&#8208;life. Promising properties for high&#8208;performance MOST applications are demonstrated, such as high absorption onsets reaching 539 nm, and energy densities of 379 kJ/kg, while still maintaining long half&#8208;lives of the metastable isomer, up to 23 hours at 25 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>AuNP@ MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 nanocomposite for the valorization of nitroarene by green catalytic hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of a catalytic process is assessed based on conversion, yield, and time effectiveness. However, these parameters are insufficient for evaluating environmentally sustainable research. As the world is urged to shift towards green catalysis, additional factors such as reaction media, raw material availability, sustainability, waste minimization and catalyst biosafety, need to be considered to accurately determine the efficacy and sustainability of the process. By combining the high porosity and versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and the activity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), efficient, cyclable and biosafe composite catalysts can be achieved. Thus, a composite based on AuNPs and the nanometric flexible porous iron(III) aminoterephthalate MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 was successfully synthesized and fully characterized. This nanocomposite was tested as catalyst in the reduction of nitroarenes, which were identified as anthropogenic water pollutants, reaching cyclable high conversion rates at short times for different nitroarenes. Both synthesis and catalytic reactions were performed using green conditions, and even further tested in a time&#8208;optimizing one&#8208;pot synthesis and catalysis experiment. The sustainability and environmental impact of the catalytic conditions were assessed by green metrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Centered Reactivity of a Transition Metal Bound Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN). Despite no longer exhibiting a constrained geometry when coordinated to metal centres, the P(NNN) phosphine retains its ability to activate polar E&#8722;H bonds (including those of amines and ammonia).







Abstract
The electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar (C2v symmetric) acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN), are described. On complexation to metal centers, the phosphine was found to adopt a distorted trigonal pyramidal structure with a high barrier to pyramidal inversion (22.3&#8197;kcal/mol at 298&#8197;K for Au[P(NNN)]Cl). Spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations carried out at the density functional level of theory indicate that P(NNN) is a moderate &#963;&#8208;donor, with significant &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. Despite the distortion undergone by the phosphorus atom on coordination to metal centers, the P(NNN) ligand retains its ability to react with small molecule substrates with polar E&#8722;H bonds (MeOH, NH2Ph, NH3). It does so in a concerted fashion across one of the P&#8722;N bonds, and reversibly in the case of amine substrates. This cooperative bond activation chemistry may ultimately prove beneficial in catalysis.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlation of Five&#8208;Coordinate Trigonal Bipyramidal High Spin Cobalt(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of magnetometry and multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal large positive axial zero&#8208;field splitings, D&#8217;s, for 8 and 9 (24&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 32&#8197;cm&#8722;1), and in&#8208;depth ligand field analyses on top of wave function based ab initio calculations demonstrated that the Co(II) out&#8208;of&#8208;equatorial plane distance, &#948;, determines the sign and magnitude of D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal high spin Co(II) complexes.







Abstract
Here, we combined magnetometry, multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance, and wave function based ab initio calculations to investigate magnetic properties of two high spin Co(II) complexes Co(BDPRP) (BDPRP=2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;R)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidi&#8208;nyl)methyl)pyridine, R=H for 8; R=tBu for 9). Complexes&#8197;8 and 9 featuring effective D3h symmetry were found to possess D=24.0 and 32.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively, in their S=3/2 ground states of 
. Ligand field analyses revealed that the low&#8208;lying d&#8208;d excited states make either positive or vanishing contributions to D. Hence, total positive D values were measured for 8 and 9, as well as related D3h high spin Co(II) complexes. In contrast, negative D values are usually observed for C3v congeners. In&#8208;depth analyses suggested that lowering symmetry from D3h to C3v induces orbital mixing between 
 and 
 and admixes excited state 
 into the ground state. Both factors turn the total D value progressively negative with the increasing distance (&#948;) of the Co(II) center out of the equatorial plane. Therefore, &#948; determines the sign and magnitude of final D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal S=3/2 Co(II) complexes as measured for a series of such species with varying &#948;.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of magnetometry and multi-frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal large positive axial zero-field splitings, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;s, for &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; (24&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;32&lt;/i&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and in-depth ligand field analyses on top of wave function based ab initio calculations demonstrated that the Co(II) out-of-equatorial plane distance, &#948;, determines the sign and magnitude of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; values of five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal high spin Co(II) complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we combined magnetometry, multi-frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance, and wave function based ab initio calculations to investigate magnetic properties of two high spin Co(II) complexes Co(BDP&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;P) (BDP&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;P=2,6-bis((2-(S)-di(4-R)phenylhydroxylmethyl-1-pyrrolidi-nyl)methyl)pyridine, R=H for &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;; R=&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu for &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;). Complexes&#8197;&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; featuring effective &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; symmetry were found to possess &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;=24.0 and 32.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, in their &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=3/2 ground states of 
. Ligand field analyses revealed that the low-lying d-d excited states make either positive or vanishing contributions to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. Hence, total positive &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; values were measured for &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, as well as related &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; high spin Co(II) complexes. In contrast, negative &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; values are usually observed for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; congeners. In-depth analyses suggested that lowering symmetry from &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; induces orbital mixing between 
 and 
 and admixes excited state 
 into the ground state. Both factors turn the total &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; value progressively negative with the increasing distance (&#948;) of the Co(II) center out of the equatorial plane. Therefore, &#948; determines the sign and magnitude of final &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; values of five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=3/2 Co(II) complexes as measured for a series of such species with varying &#948;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TBADT&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Stereoselective Radical Alkylation of Chiral N&#8208;Sulfinyl Imines: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Diverse Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. It utilizes non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, yielding diverse chiral amines with excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This approach offers efficient access to a variety of relevant &#945;&#8208;amino acids or alcohols and 1,2 diamines.







Abstract
Herein we describe a sustainable and efficient photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. By employing readily available non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and the cost&#8208;effective TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, we successfully obtain diverse chiral amines with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This method provides an efficient approach for accessing a diverse array of medicinally relevant compounds, including both natural and synthetic &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl ethyl amines, and other structural motifs commonly found in approved pharmaceuticals and natural product.

         <title>A New Molybdenum Blue Structure Type: How Uranium Expands this Family of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding uranyl nitrate to a solution that would otherwise crystallize the MB wheel Mo154 instead directed the formation and crystallization of Mo72U8, a new MB structure type. Uranium(IV) can be used as both heterometal and reductant in the formation of Mo90U10 type MB wheels. A dehydration induced phase change leads to formation of a sheet of these wheels connected by uranyl oxygen to molybdenum bonds, the first reported of their kind.







Abstract
The assembly of molybdenum polyoxometalates (POMs) has afforded large discrete nanoclusters with varied degrees of reduction such as the ~20&#8201;% reduced molybdenum blues. While many heterometals have been incorporated into these clusters to afford new properties, uranium has yet to be reported. Here we report the first uranium containing molybdenum blue clusters and the unique properties exhibited by this incorporation. The uranyl ion (UO22+) directs formation of Mo72U8, a square POM comprised of two faces connected by eight edge&#8208;sharing molybdenum dimers. Mo72U8, a chiral cluster, crystallizes as a racemic mixture and, in the solid state, has a &#8216;negative&#8217; charge localized on one face of the cluster opposite the &#8216;positively&#8217; charged face of another cluster. Using U(IV) as both heterometal and molybdenum reductant afforded crystals of Mo97U10, a wheel cluster with a heptamolybdate cap on one face. Mo97U10 dissociates in solution, losing the heptamolybdate, to form Mo90U10. Using more solvent during synthesis afforded crystals of Mo90U10S4 which, instead of heptamolybdate, contains four sulfate ions. Crystals of Mo90U10S4 undergo a dehydration induced phase change where clusters form a sheet through oxide bridges. Half of the bridges are cation&#8208;cation interactions between the uranyl oxygen atom and molybdenum, the first reported of this kind.

         <title>Reversible Coupling of Germylone with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge(0) compound 5 undergoes coupling with isocyanates to afford imine&#8208;ligated alkyl carboxamido germylenes 7 and 8. Moreover, this addition is reversible, as evidenced by an exchange reaction of 8 with p&#8208;tolyl isocyanate and by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The germylone dimNHCGe (5, dimNHC=diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with isocyanates RNCO (R=4&#8208;tolyl or 3,5&#8208;xylyl) to furnish novel alkyl carboxamido germylenes 7 (R=4&#8208;tolyl) and 8 (R=3,5&#8208;xylyl), featuring a C&#8722;C bond between the former carbene carbon and the isocyanate moiety. Heating a mixture of 8 with 4&#8208;tolyl isocyanate to 100&#8201;&#176;C results in isocyanate metathesis, demonstrating reversible C&#8722;C bond formation on the reduced germanium compound. DFT calculations suggest that this process occurs via the reductive dissociation of isocyanate from 8 that regenerates the parent Ge(0) compound 5.

         <title>para&#8211;Phenylenediamine Dimer as a Redox&#8211;Active Guest for Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Para&#8211;phenylenediamine dimers with the biphenyl centrepieces form supramolecular complexes with multiple units of &#945;/&#946;/&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins and/or cucurbit[7/8]urils. Several redox agents were tested for switching between fully reduced colourless and partially oxidised deep blue diradical forms. The reducing effect of some agents was selectively inhibited by complexation with cucurbit[7]uril.







Abstract
Redox&#8211;active components are highly valuable in the construction of molecular devices. We combined two p&#8208;phenylenediamines (p&#8208;PDA) with a biphenyl (BiPhe) unit to prepare a supramolecular guest 4 consisting of three binding sites for cucurbit[7/8]uril (CBn) and/or cyclodextrins (CD). Supramolecular properties of 4 were investigated using NMR, UV&#8208;vis, mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our analysis revealed that 4 forms higher&#8211;order host&#8211;guest complexes, wherein a CD unit occupies the central BiPhe site, secured by two CBn units at the terminal p&#8208;PDA sites. Additionally, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CD, a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex with &#947;&#8208;CD and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with CB7 and CB8 were identified. Through UV&#8208;vis and cyclic voltammetry, redox processes leading to the formation of a stable, deep blue dication diradical of 4 are elucidated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that CB7 selectively protects oxidised 4 from reduction in the presence of a reducing agent. The supramolecular and redox properties of the structural motif represented by 4 render it an interesting candidate for the construction of supramolecular devices.

Through UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry, redox processes leading to the formation of a stable, deep blue dication diradical of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; are elucidated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that CB7 selectively protects oxidised &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; from reduction in the presence of a reducing agent. The supramolecular and redox properties of the structural motif represented by &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; render it an interesting candidate for the construction of supramolecular devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Structural, Optical and Magnetic Modifications in Lanthanide SMMs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets are fascinating objects that break magnetic performance records with observable magnetic bistability at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen, paving the way for potential applications in high&#8208;density data storage. The switching of lanthanide SMM has been successfully achieved using several external stimuli such as redox reaction, pH titration, light irradiation or solvation/desolvation thanks to the high sensitivity of the magnetic anisotropy to any structural change in the lanthanide surrounding. Nevertheless, the use of applied high pressure as an external stimulus is largely underused, especially considering that it can be combined with high pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction to establish a complementary structure&#8208;property relationship. This Concept article summarizes the few relevant examples of investigations of lanthanide SMMs under applied high pressure, provides conclusions on the effect of such stimulus on molecular structures and magnetic anisotropy, and finally draws perspective on the future development of magnetic measurements under applied pressure.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal reactions emerged a decade ago as a novel strategy to implement spatiotemporal control over enzymatic functions and pharmacological interventions. The use of this methodology in experimental therapy is driven by the ambition of improving the tolerability and PK properties of clinically&#8208;used therapeutic agents. The preclinical potential of bioorthogonal catalysis has been validated in vitro and in vivo with the in situ generation of a broad range of drugs, including cytotoxic agents, anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and anxiolytics. In this article, we report our investigations towards the preparation of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I)&#8208;microdevices and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. A range of ligand&#8208;functionalized polymeric devices and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. Last, we present a preliminary exploration of their use for the synthesis of PROTACs through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Dearomatizing Cyclizations of 5&#8208;Arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Samarium Diiodide &#8211; A Computational Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study analyzes the samarium diiodide&#8208;promoted cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones to dearomatized bicyclic products utilizing density functional theory. The reaction involves a single electron transfer to the carbonyl group, which occurs synchronously with the rate determining cyclization event, and a second subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. These redox reactions are accurately computed employing small core pseudo potentials explicitly involving all f&#8208;electrons of samarium. Comparison of the energies of the possible final products rules out thermodynamic control of the observed regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Kinetic control via appropriate transition states is correctly predicted, but to obtain reasonable energy levels the influence of the co&#8208;solvent hexamethylphosphortriamide has to be estimated by using a correction term. The steric effect of the bulky samarium ligands is decisive for the observed stereoselectivity. Carbonyl groups in para&#8208;position of the aryl group change the regioselectivity of the cyclization and lead to spiro compounds. The computations suggest again kinetic control of this deviating outcome. However, the standard mechanism has to be modified and the involvement of a complex activated by two SmI2 moieties is proposed in which two electrons are transferred simultaneously to form the new C&#8211;C bond. Computation of model intermediates show the feasibility of this alternative mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Oriented Asymmetric Catalysis: Conformational Modulation of Transition State Multivalency during a Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Assembly of a Pharmaceutically Relevant Atropisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of superbasic, bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts is presented, which enables the organocatalytic, atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral quinazolinediones. Computational modeling unveiled the conformational modulation of the catalyst by a novel phenyl urea N&#8208;cap, that preorganizes the structure into the active, folded state. A previously unanticipated noncovalent interaction involving a difluoroacetamide acting as a hybrid mono&#8208; or bidentate hydrogen bond donor emerged as a decisive control element inducing atroposelectivity. These discoveries spurred from a scaffold&#8208;oriented project inspired from a fascinating investigational BTK inhibitor featuring two stable chiral axes and relies on a mechanistic framework that was foreign to the extant lexicon of asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cavity Catalysis of an Enantioselective Reaction under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavity catalysis: Vibro&#8208;polaritonic states influence an enantioselective reaction under strong coupling. An increase in the conversion yield is obtained by coupling the carbonyl band of the reactant to an infrared cavity without affecting the enantiomeric excess. These experiments underline the use of polaritonic chemistry for selective control of chemical reactions by coupling to vacuum fluctuations.







Abstract
Strong light&#8208;matter interaction is emerging as an exciting tool for controlling chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate an L&#8208;proline&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric Aldol reaction under vibrational strong coupling. Both the reactants (4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone) carbonyl bands are coupled to an infrared photon and react in the presence of L&#8208;proline. The reaction mixture is eluted from the cavity, and the conversion yields and enantiomeric excess are quantified using NMR and chiral HPLC. The conversion yields increase by up to 90&#8201;% in ON&#8208;resonance conditions. Interestingly, a large increase in the conversion yield does not affect the enantiomeric excess. Further control experiments were carried out by varying the temperature, and we propose that the rate&#8208;limiting step may not be the deciding factor in enantioselectivity. Whereas the formation of the enamine intermediate is modified by cavity coupling experiments. For this class of enantioselective reactions, strong coupling does not change the enantiomeric excess, possibly due to the large energy difference in chiral transition states. Strong coupling can boost the formation of enamine intermediate, thereby favouring the product yield. This gives more hope to test polaritonic chemistry based on enantioselective reactions in which the branching ratios can be controlled.

         <title>Photosensitizers Enable the Formation of Biphenyls with UV&#8208;LEDs and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significantly improved method for metal&#8208;free biaryl synthesis through the photochemical extrusion of traceless linkers (photosplicing) is presented. An array of aldehydes and ketones have been identified as powerful photosensitizers that eliminate the requirement for UV&#8722;C light, allowing the use of UV LEDs and even sunlight. This advancement not only simplifies the reaction setup but also enables the scalable production of biphenyls.







Abstract
The regioselective synthesis of biphenyls, which are economically important pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and liquid crystals, is a challenging task. Current methods rely on metal&#8208;dependent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which unfortunately require the use of harmful halogenated aryls and heavy metal catalysts that are toxic and difficult to remove from the final products. Recently, we have circumvented these problems by developing a metal&#8208;free and broadly applicable photochemical method for biphenyl synthesis using UV&#8722;C light, called photosplicing. Here we present an improved method using photosensitizers in combination with UV&#8722;B, UV&#8722;A light, or sunlight. Using a high&#8208;precision flow reactor with deep&#8208;UV LEDs, we investigated the ability of commonly available organic photosensitizers to enhance the photosplicing reaction and identified a number of suitable photosensitizers with the required triplet energy. This method allows for easy batch synthesis of biaryls in borosilicate glassware and paves the way for their large&#8208;scale production without the need for flow reactors.

         <title>Bending a Cumulene with Electrons: Stepwise Chemical Reduction and Structural Study of a Tetraaryl[4]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bend or not to bend? The chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene using cesium gives the mono&#8208; and doubly&#8208;reduced cumulenes. Crystallographic analysis reveals dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene with cesium metal was explored, and the structural changes stemming from electron acquisition are detailed using X&#8208;ray crystallography. It is found that the [4]cumulene undergoes dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar. The structural deformation is consistent with early theoretical reports that suggest that the twisting should occur upon reduction of both even and odd [n]cumulenes. The current results, on the other hand, are inconsistent with a previous experimental study of a [3]cumulene in which the predicted twisting is not observed upon reduction. DFT calculations reveal that the barrier to deformation is an order of magnitude lower in a [3]cumulene than a [4]cumulene, allowing the barrier to be overcome in the solid&#8208;state.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidation of Polycyclic Aromatic Amines Towards Carbazoles and Phenazine&#8208;based Aza&#8208;helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;&#8208;conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary&#8208;, ternary&#8208;, and quaternary&#8208;fused PAAs as electro&#8208;oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K&#8208;region, Bay&#8208;region, and L&#8208;region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8208;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron&#8208;deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8208;C(&#945;)&#8208;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro&#8208;oxidative reaction of PAA.</dc:description>

         <title>64  Cu tumor labeling with hexadentate picolinic acid&#8208;based bispidine immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discussed are two picolinate appended bispidine ligands (3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives) in comparison with an earlier described bis&#8208;pyridine derivative, which are all known to strongly bind CuII. The radiopharmacological characterization of the two isomeric bispidine complexes includes quantitative labeling with 64CuII at ambient conditions with high radiochemical purities and yields (molar activities &gt; 200 MBq/nmol). Challenge experiments in presence of EDTA, cyclam, human serum and SOD demonstrate high stability and inertness of the 64Cu&#8208;bispidine complexes. Biodistribution studies performed in Wistar rats indicate a rapid renal elimination for both 64Cu&#8208;labeled chelates. The bispidine ligand with the picolinate group in N7 position was selected for further biological experiments, and its backbone was therefore substituted with a benzyl&#8208;NCS group at C9. Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS&#8208;functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor&#8208;bearing mice showed very good and specific accumulation of the 64Cu&#8208;labeled TMs in tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>A pH&#8208;Sensitive Double Chromophore Fluorescent Dye for&#160;Live&#8208;Tracking of Lipophagy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid droplet (LD) degradation provides metabolic energy and important building blocks for various cellular processes. The two major LD degradation pathways include autophagy (lipophagy), which involves delivery of LDs to autolysosomes, and lipolysis, which is mediated by lipases. While abnormalities in LD degradation are associated with various pathological disorders, our understanding of lipophagy is still rudimentary. In this study, we describe the development of a lipophilic dye containing two fluorophores, one of which is pH&#8208;sensitive and the other pH&#8208;stable. We further demonstrate that this &#8220;Lipo&#8208;Fluddy&#8221; can be used to visualize and quantify lipophagy in living cells, in an easily applicable and protein label&#8208;free approach. After estimating the ability of compound candidates to penetrate LDs, we synthesized several BODIPY and (pH&#8208;switchable) rhodol dyes, whose fluorescence properties (incl. their photophysical compatibility) were analyzed. Of three Lipo&#8208;Fluddy dyes synthesized, one exhibited the desired properties and allowed observation of lipophagy by fluorescence microscopy. Also, this dye proved to be non&#8208;toxic and suitable for the examination of various cell lines. A method was developed to quantify the lipophagy process using flow cytometry, which could be applied in the future in the identification of lipophagy&#8208;related genes or in the screening of potential drugs against lipophagy&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

We further demonstrate that this &#8220;Lipo-Fluddy&#8221; can be used to visualize and quantify lipophagy in living cells, in an easily applicable and protein label-free approach. After estimating the ability of compound candidates to penetrate LDs, we synthesized several BODIPY and (pH-switchable) rhodol dyes, whose fluorescence properties (incl. their photophysical compatibility) were analyzed. Of three Lipo-Fluddy dyes synthesized, one exhibited the desired properties and allowed observation of lipophagy by fluorescence microscopy. Also, this dye proved to be non-toxic and suitable for the examination of various cell lines. A method was developed to quantify the lipophagy process using flow cytometry, which could be applied in the future in the identification of lipophagy-related genes or in the screening of potential drugs against lipophagy-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predisposition in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Assembly of Tetrahedral Boronate Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directional bonding strategies guide the design of complex molecular architectures, yet challenges arise due to emergent behavior. Rigid structures face geometric constraints and sensitivity to mismatches, hindering the efficient assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs). Harnessing intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions offers a promising solution, broadening geometrical possibilities and enhancing adaptability to boost assembly yields. However, identifying these interactions remains challenging, with their full potential sometimes latent until final assembly. This study explores these challenges by synthesizing boronic acid tripods with varied oxygen positions at the tripodal feet and investigating their role in assembling tetrahedral boronate MOCs. Our results reveal substantial differences in the assembly efficiency among tripods. While the building blocks with oxygen in the benzylic position relative to the central aromatic ring form the MOCs in high yields, those with the oxygen atom directly bound to the central aromatic ring, only yield traces. Through X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analyses, we elucidate how intramolecular interactions profoundly influence the geometry of the building blocks and cages in a relay&#8208;like fashion, highlighting the importance of considering intramolecular interactions in the rational design of (supra)molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Fingerprints of Chalcogen Bonding Revealed Through 77Se&#8208;NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>77Se&#8208;NMR is used to characterise several chalcogen bonded complexes of derivatives of the organoselenium drug ebselen, exploring a range of electron demand. NMR titration experiments support the intuitive understanding that chalcogen bond donors bearing more electron withdrawing substituents give rise stronger chalcogen bonds. The chemical shift of the selenium nucleus is also shown to move up&#64257;eld as it participates in a chalcogen bond. Solid&#8208;state NMR is used to explore chalcogen bonding in co&#8208;crystals. Due to the lack of molecular reorientation on the NMR timescale in the solid state, the shape of the chemical shift tensor can be determined using this technique. A range of co&#8208;crystals are shown to have extremely large chemical shift anisotropy, which suggests a strongly anisotropic electron density distribution around the selenium atom. A single crystal NMR experiment was conducted using one of the co&#8208;crystals, affording the absolute orientation of the chemical shift tensor within the crystal. This showed that the selenium nucleus is strongly shielded in the direction of the chalcogen bond, and strongly deshielded in the perpendicular direction, consistent with the presence of a second &#963;&#8208;hole which is not participating in a chalcogen bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Crystalline Iodinated Eumelanin Monomer</title>

         <dc:description>We report the room temperature phosphorescence upon iodination on a crystalline eumelanin monomer with shielded hydroxyl moieties, ethyl 5,6&#8208;dimethoxyindole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (DMICE). Ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) is observed in the iodinated (IDMICE) as well as brominated (BDMICE) analogues of the eumelanin monomer derivative in solution. The triplet quantum yields (&#981;T) and intersystem crossing rates (kISC) of the halogenated eumelanin derivatives are

The halogen and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with distinct excitonic coupling and higher ISC rate promotes phosphorescence in IDMICE molecular crystals.

Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the asymmetric construction of an oxa&#8208;quaternary stereocenter via an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael (IOM) reaction in &#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone by the formation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;squaramide catalyst. Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone provide (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran with excellent stereospecificity. In general, excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee) were obtained. Furthermore, the resulting 1,1&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuran or phthalan was converted to corresponding chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides without losing the enantioselectivity. This methodology provides the core moiety of the (S)&#8208;citalopram drug.

         <title>Achieving Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes via Molecule Anchoring and lon&#8208;Transport pumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential for scale&#8208;up application has been acknowledged by researchers for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Nonetheless, the progress of the development is significantly impeded due to the instability of the interface between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Herein, efficient and environmentally benign valine (Val) were introduced as aqueous electrolyte additive to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) via functional groups in additive molecules, thus achieving reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. The amino groups present in Val molecules have a strong ability to adsorb on the surface of zinc metal, enabling the construction of anchored molecular layer on the surface of zinc anodes. The strongly polar carboxyl groups in Val molecules can act as ion&#8208;transport pumps to capture zinc ions in the double electrical layer (DEL) through coordination chemistry. Therefore, this reconstructed EEI could modulate the zinc ion flux and simultaneously suppress side reactions and dendritic growth of Zn. Consequently, a long stable cycling up to 1400 h at a high current density of 20 mA cm&#8208;2 is achieved. Additionally, Zn//V2O5 full cell with Val additive exhibit enhanced cyclability, retaining 77% capacity after 3000 cycles, displaying significant potential in promoting the commercialization of ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetically Fusing Order&#8208;Promoting and Thermoresponsive Building Blocks to Design Hybrid Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique biophysical and biochemical properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their recombinant derivatives, intrinsically disordered protein polymers (IDPPs) offer opportunities for producing multistimuli&#8208;responsive materials; their sequence&#8208;encoded disorder and tendency for phase separation facilitate the development of multifunctional materials. This review highlights the strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs), and their self&#8208;assembled structures via genetic fusion to ordered motifs such as helical or beta sheet domains. In particular, this review describes approaches that harness the synergistic interplay between order&#8208;promoting and thermoresponsive building blocks to design hybrid biomaterials, resulting in well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials ordered on the nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Sniffing Out the Sustainable Future: The Renewability Revolution in Fragrance Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What will the Sustainable Future smell like? The way into a resource&#8208;friendly economy will have different impact on the various perfumery families, but it will not be an avenue to all&#8208;natural fragrances as these have the highest carbon footprint. In this report, you can find out what a world with 100&#8201;% renewable and biodegradable fragrances smells like, and which opportunities for new ingredients arise.







Abstract
In this review, the impact of the transition from today's resource&#8208;wasting petrochemical economy towards a 100/100 renewable and biodegradable future is discussed with respect to the fragrance families: &#8220;citrus&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;fruity&#8221;, &#8220;floral&#8221;, &#8220;floriental&#8221;, &#8220;oriental&#8221;, &#8220;woody&#8221;, &#8220;chypre&#8221; and &#8220;foug&#232;re&#8221;. After benchmark data on ingredients usage, definitions on biodegradation and sustainability are given. Celebrating the 150th anniversary of synthetic vanillin, its historic synthesis from renewable starting materials serves as introduction. In the grand scheme of things, citrus scents upcycled from the beverages industry, are already an ideal case for 100/100 with new opportunities for artificial essential oils. In the fruity domain, transparent and lactonic ingredients are available in a sustainable manner. However, in the domain of green odorants, there is a lack of green chemistry for important key materials. In the floral family, renewability is more critical than biodegradability, but cost is an issue. Thanks to Ambrox and maltol, florientals and orientals will persist, while woody notes severely lack an Iso E Super replacer. In the chypre genre, patchouli became the new moss, but more musks are increasingly in demand. With their high percentage of linalool and dihydromyrcenol, the construction of foug&#232;res could well become a precedent for other families, despite challenges in vetiver and salicylates. Still, the challenges exemplified here create immense opportunities for new perfumery materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Superbulky Amide Ligands by Addition of Polar Reagents to Sila&#8208;Imine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of extremely bulky amide ligands is troubled by difficulties in deprotonation of the parent amine. As an alternative route to superbulky amide reagents, the addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8208;imine has been investigated. Attempts to synthesize the superbulky amide anion (tBu3Si)2N&#713; by addition of tBuLi to tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) failed and gave tBu3Si(tBu2HSi)NLi and isobutene. Reaction of the sila&#8208;imine with KOtBu successfully led to tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NK which crystallized as a separated ion&#8208;pair. Reaction with the slightly bulkier KOAd (Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl) led in presence of THF to ether ring&#8208;opening. Reaction with tBuOH gave tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NH but this amine cannot be easily deprotonated. Reaction with (BDI*)MgnBu in presence of THF gave (BDI*)Mg+&#183;(THF)2 and the non&#8208;coordinating anion tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#713;; BDI* = b&#8208;diketiminate ligand HC[C(tBu)N&#8208;DIPP]2, DIPP = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl. Reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) led to a Mg complex with one amide ligand: tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#713;. The other superbulky amide anion isomerized by internal deprotonation of a tBu&#8208;substituent to give a primary carbanion that is also coordinated to Mg. Although the amide&#8208;to&#8208;carbanion isomerization is highly contrathermodynamic, it allows for coordination of both anions to a single Mg center. The new bulky amides are rare cases of halogen&#8208;free weakly coordinating anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments of Nontraditional Single&#8208;Molecule Toroics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the nontraditional perspective, the exciting advances of SMTs are reviewed ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8211;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. The understanding of key design principles and the outlook on nontraditional SMTs will contribute to the design of novel SMTs.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule toroics (SMTs), defined as a type of molecules with toroidal arrangement of magnetic moment associated with bi&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic ground states, are promising candidates for high&#8208;density information storage and the development of molecule based multiferroic materials with linear magneto&#8211;electric coupling and multiferroic behavior. The design and synthesis of SMTs by arranging the magnetic anisotropy axis in a circular pattern at the molecular level have been of great interest to scientists for last two decades since the first detection of the SMT behavior in the seminal Dy3 molecules. DyIII ion has long been the ideal candidate for constructing SMTs due to its Kramer ion nature as well as high anisotropy. Nevertheless, other LnIII ions such as TbIII and HoIII ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8211;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful in designing novel SMTs.

         <title>QM/MM Study Into the Mechanism of Oxidative C=C Double Bond Cleavage by Lignostilbene&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dioxygenase</title>

Insert text for Table of Contents here: A QM/MM study on the lignin activating nonheme iron enzyme lignostilbene&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;dioxygenase is presented and shows that the mechanism is driven by electrostatic interactions in the protein pocket that trigger an early electron transfer and guides the reaction to a dioxetane intermediate.







Abstract
The enzymatic biosynthesis of fragrance molecules from lignin fragments is an important reaction in biotechnology for the sustainable production of fine chemicals. In this work we investigated the biosynthesis of vanillin from lignostilbene by a nonheme iron dioxygenase using QM/MM and tested several suggested proposals via either an epoxide or dioxetane intermediate. Binding of dioxygen to the active site of the protein results in the formation of an iron(II)&#8722;superoxo species with lignostilbene cation radical. The dioxygenase mechanism starts with electrophilic attack of the terminal oxygen atom of the superoxo group on the central C=C bond of lignostilbene, and the second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in the substrate binding pocket guide the reaction towards dioxetane formation. The computed mechanism is rationalized with thermochemical cycles and valence bond schemes that explain the electron transfer processes during the reaction mechanism. Particularly, the polarity of the protein and the local electric field and dipole moments enable a facile electron transfer and an exergonic dioxetane formation pathway.

         <title>Interfacial Bonding Induced Charge Transfer in Two&#8208;dimensional Amorphous MoO3&#8208;x/Graphdiyne Oxide Non&#8208;van der Waals Heterostructures for Dominant SERS Enhancement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown to be an effective substrate for Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. However, the enhancement factor (EF) tends to be relatively weak compared to that of noble metals and does not allow for trace detection of molecules. In this work, we report the successful preparation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous non&#8208;van der Waals heterostructures MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO nanomaterials using supercritical CO2. Due to the synergistic effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the charge transfer effect, it exhibits excellent SERS performance in the detection of methylene blue (MB) molecules, with a detection limit as low as 10&#8208;14&#160;M while the enhancement factor (EF) can reach an impressive 2.55 &#215; 1011. More importantly, the chemical bond bridging at the MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO heterostructures interface can accelerate the electron transfer between the interfaces, and the large number of defective surface structures on the heterostructures surface facilitates the chemisorption of MB molecules. And the charge recombination lifetime can be proved by a ~1.7&#8208;fold increase during their interfacial electron&#8208;transfer process for MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO@MB mixture, achieving highly sensitive SERS detection.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Free radicals are increasingly recognized as active intermediate reactive species that can participate in various redox processes, significantly influencing the mechanistic pathways of reactions. Numerous researchers have investigated the generation of one or more distinct photogenerated radicals, proposing various hypotheses to explain the reaction mechanisms. Notably, recent research has demonstrated the emergence of photogenerated radicals in innovative processes, including organic chemical reactions and the photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals. To harness the potential of these free radicals more effectively, it is imperative to consolidate and analyze the processes and action modes of these photogenerated radicals. This conceptual paper delves into the latest advancements in understanding the mechanics of photogenerated radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;Phenalenyls: the Yin and Yang of Heteroatom&#8208;doped &#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of NBN&#8208;phenalenyls are experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically investigated, shedding light on the substituent&#8208;dependent emission characteristics of these compounds. Co&#8208;aggregation of a suitable NBN&#8208; with its complementary BNB&#8208;phenalenyl in a microsuspension leads to a drastic red&#8208;shift in emission wavelength compared to the emission of an equimolar mixture in solution.







Abstract
NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;doped phenalenyls are isoelectronic to phenalenyl anions and cations, respectively. They represent a pair of complementary molecules that have essentially identical structures but opposite properties as electron donors and acceptors. The NBN&#8208;phenalenyls 1&#8211;4 considered here were prepared from N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron&#8208;containing building blocks (i.&#8201;e., BH3&#8901;SMe2 (1), p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4B(OH)2 (2), C6H5B(OH)2 (3), or MesBCl2/iPr2NEt (4)). Treatment of 1 with 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H2Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative 5. The BNB&#8208;phenalenyl 6 was synthesized from 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl&#8208;bridged diborane(6), PhNH2, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of 1, 4, and 5 originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl fragments, while that of 2 is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl to the p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4 fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &#952; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound 3 emits mainly from a less polar LE (&#952; &gt;55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&#952; &lt;55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used. An equimolar aggregate of the NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;phenalenyls 3 and 6 (in THF/H2O) shows a distinct red&#8208;shifted emission compared to that of the individual components, which originates from an intermolecular CT state.

         <title>Bimodal glycosyl donors as an emerging approach towards a general glycosylation strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic synthesis provides an accessible route to preparative scale biological glycans, although schemes to access these complex structures are often complicated by preparation of multiple monosaccharide building blocks. Bimodal glycosyl donors capable of forming both&#160;&#945;&#8208;&#160;and&#160;&#946;&#8208;anomers selectively, are an emerging tactic to reduce the required number of individual synthetic components in glycan construction. This review discusses examples of bimodal donors in the literature, and how they achieve their stereocontrol for both anomers. Notable examples include a bespoke&#160;O&#8208;2 benzyl protecting group, a strained glycal for reaction using organometallic catalysis, and a simple perbenzylated donor optimised for stereoselective glycosylation through extensive reaction tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>From Criegee to Breslow: How &#960;&#8208;Donors Steer the Route of Olefin Ozonolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While &#960;&#8208;bonds typically undergo cycloaddition with ozone, resulting in the release of much&#8208;noticed carbonyl O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates, lone&#8208;pairs of electrons tend to selectively accept a single oxygen atom from O3, producing singlet dioxygen. We questioned whether the introduction of potent electron&#8208;donating groups, akin to N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, could influence the reactivity of double bonds &#8722; shifting from cycloaddition to oxygen atom transfer or generating lesser&#8208;known, yet stabilized, donor&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates. Consequently, we conducted a comparative computational study using density functional theory on a series of model olefins with increasing polarity due to (asymmetric) &#960;&#8208;donor substitution. Reaction path computations indicate that highly polarized double bonds, instead of forming primary ozonides in their reaction with O3, exhibit a preference for accepting a single oxygen atom, resulting in a zwitterionic species formally identified as a carbene&#8208;carbonyl adduct. This previously unexplored reactivity potentially introduces aldehyde umpolung chemistry (Breslow intermediate) through olefin ozonolysis. Considering solvent effects implicitly reveals that increased solvent polarity further directs the trajectories toward a single oxygen atom transfer reactivity by stabilizing the zwitterionic character of the transition state. The competing modes of chemical reactivity can be explained by a bifurcation of the reaction valley in the post&#8208;transition state region.</dc:description>

         <title>The application of porous organic polymers as metal free photocatalysts in organic synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on our environment highlight the urgent need for new sustainable technologies. Visible light photocatalysis allows the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. The more widespread adoption of the current generation of photocatalysts, particularly those using precious metals, is hampered by drawbacks such as their cost, toxicity, difficult separation, and limited recyclability. This is driving the search for alternatives, such as porous organic polymers (POPs). This new class of materials is made entirely from organic building blocks, can possess high surface area and stability, and has a controllable composition and functionality. This review focuses on the application of POPs as photocatalysts in organic synthesis. For each reaction type, a representative material is discussed, with special attention to the mechanism of the reaction. Additionally, an overview is given, comparing POPs with other classes of photocatalysts, and critical conclusions and future perspectives are provided on this important field.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Vanadium Doping and External Modification Design of P2&#8208;Type Layered Mn&#8208;Based Oxides as Competitive Cathodes toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F, featuring synergistic modification through doping and coating. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8211;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
P2&#8208;type layered manganese&#8208;based oxides have attracted considerable interest as economical, cathode materials with high energy density for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their potential, these materials still face challenges related to sluggish kinetics and structural instability. In this study, a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F was developed by surface&#8208;coating P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2 with a thin layer of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F to enhance both the electrochemical sodium storage and material air stability. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8208;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. These findings validate the significant enhancement of ion diffusion capabilities and rate performance in the P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material conferred by the composite cathode.

         <title>From Neutral Diarsenes to Diarsene Radical Ions and Diarsene Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable main&#8208;group element&#8208;centered radicals have attracted tremendous attention. We report here the synthesis and molecular structures of both an arsenic&#8208;centered radical anion and a radical cation. In addition, the synthesis of base&#8208;coordinated and base&#8208;free diarsene dications is presented.







Abstract
Diarsene [L(MeO)GaAs]2 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, 4) reacts with MeOTf and MeNHC (MeNHC=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetra&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to the diarsene [L(TfO)GaAs]2 (5) and the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L] (6). The NHC&#8208;coordination results in an inversion of the redox properties of the diarsene 4, which shows only a reversible reduction event at E1/2=&#8722;2.06&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1, whereas the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene 6 shows a reversible oxidation event at E1/2=&#8722;1.31&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1. Single electron transfer reactions of 4 and 6 yielded [K[2.2.2.]cryp][L(MeO)GaAs]2 (8) and [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)&#8208;Ga(OMe)L][B(C6F5)4] (9) containing the radical anion [L(MeO)GaAs]2&#8901;&#8722; (8&#8901;&#8722;) and the NHC&#8208;coordinated radical cation [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L]&#8901;+ (9&#8901;+), respectively, while the salt&#8208;elimination reaction of the triflate&#8208;coordinated diarsene 5 with Na[B(C6F5)4] gave [LGaAs]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (11) containing the dication [LGaAs]22+ (112+). Compounds 1&#8211;11 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, EPR (8, 9), IR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). DFT calculations provided a detailed understanding of the electronic nature of the diarsenes (4, 6) and the radical ions (8&#8901;&#8722;, 9&#8901;+), respectively.

         <title>Constructing Hollow Microcubes SnS2 as Negative electrode for Sodium&#8208;ion and Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change.







Abstract
Sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs and KIBs) are considered the most promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy storage fields. Tin sulfide (SnS2) is regarded as an attractive negative candidate for NIBs and KIBs thanks to its superior power density, high&#8208;rate performance and natural richness. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics, the enormous volume change and the decomposition of polysulfide intermediates limit its practical application. Herein, microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change. The effect of the carbon additives (Super P/C65) on the electrochemical properties were investigated thoroughly. The in operando and ex&#8208;situ characterization provide a piece of direct evidence to clarify the storage mechanism of such conversion&#8208;alloying type negative electrode materials.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Glycosylation, Functionalization and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini review article provides an overview on the advantages and versatility of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis. We will focuse on the application of HICs in glycosylation, oxidation, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
This mini review article provides an overview on the use of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis, focusing on their chemistry and recent applications. HICs are similar to transition metals in their reactivity but have the added benefit of being environmentally benign, and are therefore commonly used as selective oxidants and eco&#8208;friendly reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we summarize various synthetic uses of hypervalent iodine reagents in reactions such as glycosylation, oxidations, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the advantages and versatility of using HICs as an environmentally sustainable alternative to heavy metals in carbohydrate chemistry.

         <title>Non&#8208;Templated Assembly of D5h&#8208;Symmetric Pd5L10 Rings by Precise Ligand Angle Adjustment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic angle variation in bis&#8208;monodentate ligands allowed the first non&#8208;templated synthesis of Pd5L10 rings. Across different PdnL2n ring sizes, the nuclearity n is correlated to the ligand binding angle, with conformational strain being the decisive factor.







Abstract
We report a series of Pd(II)nL2n coordination rings for which nuclearity is controlled by the binding angle of the corresponding bis&#8208;monodentate bridging ligands. Judicious choice of the angle within a family of rather rigid ligands allowed for the first&#8208;time to synthesize a homoleptic five&#8208;membered Pd5L10 ring that does not require any template to form. We demonstrate that control over the ring size is maintained both in the solid&#8208;, solution&#8208;, and gas&#8208;phase. Two X&#8208;ray structures of five&#8208;membered rings from ligands with ideal angles (yielding a perfect pentagonal ring) vs. suboptimal angles (resulting in a highly distorted structure) illustrate the importance of the correct ligand geometry. A mathematical model for estimating the expected ring size based on the ligand angle was derived and DFT computations show that ring&#8208;strain is the major factor determining the assembly outcome.

         <dc:description>
The reaction of rhodium enalcarbenoids with &#945;&#8208;amino ketones has led to the discovery of chemodivergent [3+3] annulations. Acyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones reacted via a protic ammonium ylide resulting in 1,2&#8208;dihydropridines (1,2&#8208;DHPs). In contrast, cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminoketones gave fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines via a vinylogous protic ammonium ylide due to a topology&#8208;driven regioselectivity switch. The 1,2&#8208;DHP and 1,4&#8208;oxazine products serve as precursors to diverse N&#8208;heterocycles. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;K. Mandal and S. Katukojvala (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303862).

         <title>Design and Asymmetric Control of Orientational Chirality by using the Combination of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) Levers and Achiral N&#8208;Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New chiral targets of orientational chirality have been designed and asymmetrically synthesized by taking advantage of N&#8208;sulfinylimine&#8208;directed nucleophilic addition/oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Orientation of single isomers has been selectively controlled by using aryl/alkynyl levers [C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) axis] and tBuSO2&#8208; protecting group on nitrogen as proven by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The key structural characteristic of resulting orientational products is shown by remote through&#8208;space blocking manner. seventeen examples of multi&#8208;step synthesis were obtained in modest to good chemical yields and complete orientational selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Masters of Mediation: MN(SiMe3)2 in Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H Latent Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoalkali compounds have undergone a far&#8208;reaching transformation being a coupling partner to a mediator in unusual organic conversions which finds its spot in the field of sustainable synthesis. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has always been the priority in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization, however alternatively, in recent times this has been seriously challenged by earth&#8208;abundant alkali metals and their complexes arriving at new sustainable organometallic reagents. In this line, the importance of MN(SiMe3)2 (M = Li, Na, K &amp; Cs) reagent revived in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization over recent years in organic synthesis is showcased in this minireview. MN(SiMe3)2 reagent with higher reactivity, enhanced stability, and bespoke cation&#8208;&#960; interaction have shown eye&#8208;opening mediated processes such as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling, radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling, aminobenzylation, annulation, aroylation, and other transformations to utilize readily available petrochemical feedstocks. This article also emphasizes the unusual reactivity of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent in unreactive and robust C&#8722;X (X = O, N, F, C) bond cleavage reactions that occurred alongside the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Overall, this review encourages the community to exploit the untapped potential of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent and also inspires them to take up this subject to even greater heights.</dc:description>

         <title>Unrevealing the nitrogen elusive chirality of 3&#8208;sulfanyl and 3&#8208;sulfinyl N&#8208;tosyl isoindolinones by ECD spectra: an experimental and theoretical investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitrogen&#8208;hybridization/pyramidalization of two solvated N&#8208;tosylisoindolinone derivatives having chiral residues in adjacent (I) or adjacent and distal (II) position has been investigated by a theoretical&#8208;computational procedure based on Molecular Dynamics simulations and Quantum&#8208;Chemical calculations. After validation of our strategy in providing a reliable repertory of conformations through the modeling of the electronic circular dichroism (EDC) spectra, the electronic features associated with N&#8208;pyramidalization were further characterized by Natural Bond Order (NBO) analysis. Using the N&#8208;geometry found in crystal structures as a reference, our findings reveal that the presence of neighbouring chiral centers generates sharper N&#8208;pyramidalization in solution than in the solid state, both in I and II. Furthermore, although NBO analysis confirms that the N&#8208;lactam mostly retains the sp2 character, its slight configurational distortion (&#958;I = 13&#176;; &#958;II = 21&#176;) emerges significantly in the chiroptical activities exhibited by I and II in ECD spectra, thereby substantiating these N&#8208;lactams as configurationally stable chiral centers.</dc:description>

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Topological Switch Based on a DNA Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotide based on a human telomeric sequence but with the first three&#8208;nucleotide intervening stretch replaced by a putative 15&#8208;nucleotide hairpin&#8208;forming sequence shows a pH&#8208;dependent folding into different quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrids in a potassium containing buffer. At slightly acidic pH, the quadruplex domain adopts a chair&#8208;type conformation. Upon increasing the pH, a transition with a midpoint close to neutral pH to a major and minor (3+1) hybrid topology with either a coaxially stacked or orthogonally oriented duplex stem&#8208;loop occurs. NMR&#8208;derived high&#8208;resolution structures reveal that an adenine protonation is prerequisite for the formation of a non&#8208;canonical base quartet, capping the outer G&#8208;tetrad at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface and stabilizing the antiparallel chair conformation in an acidic environment. Being directly associated with interactions at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface, this unique pH&#8208;dependent topological transition is fully reversible. Coupled with a conformation&#8208;sensitive optical readout demonstrated as a proof of concept using the fluorescent dye thiazole orange, the present quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrid architecture represents a potentially valuable pH&#8208;sensing system responsive in a physiological pH range of 7&#177;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Driving triplet state population in benzothioxanthene imide dyes: Let&#8217;s twist!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the formation of photoexcited triplet states is critical for many (photo)chemical and physical applications. Here, we demonstrate that a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) dye promotes intersystem crossing by increasing spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This manipulation was achieved through a subtle chemical modification, specifically the bay&#8208;area methylation. Consequently, this simple yet efficient approach expands the catalog of known molecular engineering strategies for synthesizing heavy atom&#8208;free, dual redox&#8208;active, yet still emissive and synthetically accessible photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Divergent Synthesis of Indole Alkaloid Derivatives by an Atypical Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an Ugi multicomponent approach to explore the chemical space around Aspidosperma&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. By variation of the isocyanide and carboxylic acid inputs we demonstrate the rapid generation of molecular diversity and the possibility to introduce handles for further modification. The key Ugi three&#8208;component reaction showed full diastereoselectivity towards the cis&#8208;fused ring system, which can be rationalized by DFT calculations. &#160;Moreover indicating that the reaction proceeds via a Passerini&#8208;type hydrogen bonding mechanism. Several post&#8208;Ugi modifications were also performed, including Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to highly complex nonacyclic natural product hybrid scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Control of the Temperature Responsiveness of Fluorescent Macrocyclic Molecular Rotamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To fully harness the potential of molecular machines, it is crucial to develop methods by which to exert control over their speed of motion through the application of external stimuli. A conformationally strained macrocyclic fluorescent rotamer, CarROT, displays a reproducible and linear fluorescence decrease towards temperature over the physiological temperature range. Through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation, the compound can access four discreet rotational speeds via supramolecular interactions (very slow, slow, fast and very fast) which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system. Through comparison with analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom, the high thermosensitivity of CarROT over the physiological temperature range was determined to be due to conformational strain, which causes a high energy barrier to rotation over this range.&#160; Analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom display lower sensitivities towards temperature over the same temperature range. This study provides an example of an information rich small molecule, in which programable rotational speed states can be observed with facile read&#8208;out.</dc:description>

Through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation, the compound can access four discreet rotational speeds via supramolecular interactions (very slow, slow, fast and very fast) which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non-radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system. Through comparison with analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom, the high thermosensitivity of CarROT over the physiological temperature range was determined to be due to conformational strain, which causes a high energy barrier to rotation over this range.&#160; Analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom display lower sensitivities towards temperature over the same temperature range. This study provides an example of an information rich small molecule, in which programable rotational speed states can be observed with facile read-out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Complexation with Fe(0) of a Tight&#8208;bite Bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, reactivity, and complexation with Fe(0) precursor of a tight&#8208;bite bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) (bis(NHSi)) ligand 1 are reported. The reaction of 1 with p&#8208;toluidine led to the activation of both N&#8211;H bonds across Si(II) atoms to afford a rare four&#8208;membered heterocyclic cyclodisilazane 2, with hydride substituents attached to five&#8208;coordinate Si atoms. A 1:2 reaction of 1 with Fe(CO)5 led to an intriguing dinuclear complex 3 featuring a five&#8208;membered (N&#8208;Si&#8208;Fe&#8208;Fe&#8208;Si) ring with a Fe&#8211;Fe bond distance of 2.6892(13) &#197;. All compounds (1&#8208;3) were thoroughly characterized by various spectro&#173;scopic methods and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies conclusively established their molecular structures. DFT calculations were carried out to shed light on bonding and energetic aspects in 1&#8208;3.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208; and Alkoxybenziodoxoles: Facile Preparation and Use as Arynophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here on the facile synthesis of amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes supported by a benziodoxole (BX) template and&#160;their use as arynophiles. The amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX derivatives can be readily synthesized by reacting the respective amines or alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole in the presence of a suitable base. Unlike previously known nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;bound iodane compounds, which have primarily been employed as electrophilic group transfer agents or oxidants, the present amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX reagents manifest themselves as nucleophilic amino and alkoxy transfer agents toward arynes. This reactivity leads to the aryne insertion into the N&#8211;I(III) or O&#8211;I(III) bond to afford ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and ortho&#8208;alkoxyarylbenziodoxoles, iodane compounds nontrivial to procure by existing methods. The BX group in these insertion products exhibits excellent leaving group ability, enabling diverse downstream transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea&#8208;Comprising Single Core Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives: Exploring the Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly and Charge Transport Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and charge transport properties of two urea&#8208;containing single core thiophene&#8208;capped diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives. The subtle differences in molecular design dictate the superior electronic properties of the lactam&#8208;functionalized analogue







Abstract
Supramolecular electronics exploits the distinctive features stemming from noncovalent interactions, guiding the self&#8208;assembly of molecules to craft materials endowed with customized electronic functionalities. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded materials, characterized by their capacity to establish dynamic and stable networks, introduce an extra dimension to the development of supramolecular electronic systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of two remarkably small semiconductors utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalized with urea units as hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs, strategically positioned at opposing ends of the conjugated core. We show how the subtle distinction in functionalization not only influences morphology and self&#8208;assembly dynamics via hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking formation, but also holds significant consequences for ultimate charge transport properties. Our observations into the interplay of noncovalent interactions provide valuable insights and strategic pathways for the design of novel materials with enhanced electronic characteristics.

         <title>Layer by Layer Spraying Fabrication of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Thin Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) thin film were prepared by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) based ligand through a liquid&#8208;phase epitaxial (LPE) layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) spraying method, which is named AIE surface&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks thin film (AIE&#8208;SURMOF). The obtained AIE&#8208;SURMOF has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property. Furthermore, by loading chiral guest in the MOF pore, the formed chiral encapsulated AIE&#8208;SURMOF can clearly indicate obvious circularly polarized luminescence performance.







Abstract
The development of new metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) thin films is important for expanding their functions and applications. Herein, we first report a new kind of MOF thin film by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) dicarboxyl ligand through a liquid&#8208;phase epitaxial (LPE) layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) spraying method (named AIE surface&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks thin film, AIE&#8208;SURMOF). The obtained AIE&#8208;SURMOF Zn4O(TPE)3 (ZnTPE) has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property. Furthermore, by loading chiral guest in the MOF pore, the formed chiral encapsulated AIE&#8208;SURMOF can clearly indicate obvious circularly polarized luminescence performance with glum of 0.01. This study provides new MOF thin film and new strategy for expanding function and application of MOF materials.

         <title>From the Total Synthesis of Semi&#8211;Viriditoxin, Semi&#8211;Viriditoxic Acid and Dimeric Naphthopyranones to their Biological Activities in Burkitt B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various naphthopyranones were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxicity and apoptotic activity. The synthesis was carried out using two building blocks, which were prepared from enantiomerically pure oxiranes and methyl acetoacetate and then reacted with each other to form naphthopyranones. Monomeric and dimeric naphthopyranones were synthesized and then a structure&#8211;activity relationship study was carried out.







Abstract
Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8211;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (Ghosez&#8211;cyclization and Grubbs ring&#8211;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8211;Michael&#8211;Dieckmann reaction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.

         <title>Stabilization of Lantern&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs) by Protective Control of Ligand Exchange Rates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stability of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) in solution depends on steric bulk and hydrophobicity proximal to the paddlewheel nodes. Increased bulk from alkyl side chains increases the effective half&#8208;life of the cages in competitive &#8220;MOC+MOC&#8221; equilibrations from thirty minutes to three hours. Solvent coligands play a similar role in protecting the metal nodes and reducing exchange rates.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling systems in nature display remarkable complexity with assemblies of different sub&#8208;units to generate functional species. Synthetic analogues of such systems are a challenge, often requiring the ability to bias distributions that are under thermodynamic assembly control. Using lantern&#8208;type MOCs (metal&#8208;organic cages) as a prototypical self&#8208;assembling system, herein we explore the role that steric bulk plays in controlling the exchange rate of ligands in paddlewheel&#8208;based assemblies, and thus the stability of cages, in competitive self&#8208;assembling scenarios. The effective lifetime of the lantern&#8208;type MOCs varies over an order of magnitude depending on the steric bulk proximal to the metal nodes with lifetimes of the cages ranging from tens of minutes to several hours. The bulk of the coordinating solvents likewise reduces the rate of ligand exchange, and thus yields longer&#8208;lived species. Understanding this subtle effect has implications for controlling the stability of complex assemblies in competitive environments with implications for guest release and application.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Solvatochirochromism of Single Benzene Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents is reported. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.







Abstract
Solvents influence the structure, aggregation and folding behaviors of solvatochromic compounds. Ultrasensitive solvent mediated chiroptical response is conducive to the fabrication of molecular platform for sensing and recognition, which however, remains great challenges in conceptual or applicable design. Here we report a cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents. Compared to the ratiometrically responsive systems, the chiroptical activities could be triggered or inverted depending on the substituents of chiral entities with an ultralow solvent volume fraction (&lt;1&#8197;vol&#8201;%). One drop of dipolar solvents shall significantly induce the emergence or inversion of chiroptical signals in bulky phases. Based on the experimental and computational studies, the ultrasensitivity is contributed to the intimate interplay between solvents and chiral compounds that anchors the specific chiral conformation. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complex of the Parent Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;reactive complex (HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl) in prototype phosphinidene insertion reactions has been observed in the photoreaction between the parent phosphinidene PH and HCl in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 10&#8197;K. This hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is highly unstable, as its structure varies in the presence of other weak hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors such as N2 and HCl.







Abstract
The diatomic molecule PH is very reactive, and it serves as the parent compound for phosphinidenes featuring a monovalent phosphorus atom. Herein, we report the characterization and reactivity of a rare hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex of PH. Specifically, the molecular complex between PH and HCl has been generated by photolysis of chlorophosphine (H2PCl) at 254&#8197;nm in a solid Ar&#8208;matrix at 10&#8197;K. The IR spectrum of the complex HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl and quantum chemical calculations at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/haTZ level consistently prove that the phosphorus atom acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor with a binding energy (D0) of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In line with the observed absorption at 341&#8197;nm for the binary complex, the triplet phosphinidene PH undergoes prototype H&#8722;Cl bond insertion by reformation of H2PCl upon photoexcitation at 365&#8197;nm. However, this hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is unstable in the presence of N2 and HCl, as both molecules prefers stronger interactions with HCl than PH in the observed complexes HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N2 and HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;2HCl.

         <title>Selectivity in Adduct Formation of a Bidentate Boron Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adduct formation of a bidentate boron Lewis acid with diamines and &#8208;phosphines with an increasing linker length was observed in solution by NMR experiments and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction. This study offers insight into the selectivity of the host&#8208;guest adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with host molecules of varying size.







Abstract
A bidentate boron Lewis acid based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene has been studied in detail with respect to its adduct formation with diamines and diphosphanes of different linker lengths between the donor functions. A clear correlation between the linker length of the bifunctional base and the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adducts or oligomers was found. The adducts were characterized in solution by NMR titration experiments and structurally by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, adduct formation and competition experiments of the host system with ZR3 (Z=N, P; R=H, Me) demonstrated the generally higher stability of alkylphosphane adducts compared to alkylamine adducts with boron functions. The results provide a general insight into the adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with guests of different sizes as well as the differences in stability between borane&#8208;amine and borane&#8208;phosphane adducts.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Eosin Y&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Organic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed Eosin Y was prepared by radical photopolymerization to obtain new heterogeneous photocatalyst with a well&#8208;defined morphology. Taking advantage of the 3D&#8208;printing technology, the heterogeneous EY was designed to fit around the magnetic stirring bar to facilitate both implementation of various organic transformations and catalyst recovery. This very robust photocatalyst is easily recycled and the efficiency was still very high even after 8 reactions.







Abstract
Heterogenization of Eosin Y by 3D&#8208;printing and its application in photocatalysis are reported. The approach allows a fine tuning of the photocatalyst morphology and its rapid preparation. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated through model organic reactions involving oxidation, reduction, and photosensitization pathways. The efficiency, recyclability and stability of 3D printed EY is remarkable paving the way to new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts with a perfect control of their shape and adaptable to any photoreactors.

         <title>Ultrafast Halogen Dance Reactions of Bromoarenes Enabled by Catalytic Potassium Hexamethyldisilazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen&#8208;dance&#8208;type reactions to provide bromoarenes without aryne formation. KHMDS exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu, which is used stoichiometrically in the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed, demonstrating the potential of new catalytic reactions based on highly reactive mixed organometallic species.







Abstract
Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base, a stoichiometric combination of nBuLi and KOtBu, is commonly used as a superbase for deprotonating a wide range of organic compounds. In the present study, we report that catalytic potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu for successive bromine&#8211;metal exchanges. Accordingly, 1&#8211;10&#8197;mol% of KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen dance reactions to introduce various electrophiles to bromopyridine, bromoimidazole, bromothiophene, bromofuran, and bromobenzene derivatives with the bromo group translocated from the original position. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed to explain the ultrafast bromine transfer.

         <title>First Potassium Fluoroaluminate Ionic Exchanger for Rapid and Selective Removal of Sr2+ with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Remarkable potassium fluoroaluminate possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of (qm=~120.32&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions.







Abstract
90Sr, as a typical artificial radionuclide, poses a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment. The selective removal of this radionuclide from industrial nuclear waste is crucial for our environment. Here we report a novel potassium fluoroaluminate, K2[(AlF5)H2O], which was synthesized by a simple low&#8208;temperature one&#8208;step method. It adopts a 1D AlF6&#8208;chain structure, which consists of exchangeable potassium ions in between the infinite chains of octahedral Al centers. As a remarkable inorganic ionic exchanger, K2[(AlF5)H2O] has a high chemical stability (resistance of pH=~3&#8208;12) and thermal stability (&#8805;~300&#8201;&#176;C). It possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of qm=~120.32&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions. K2[(AlF5)H2O] is the first example of fluoroaluminate ionic exchange materials that can capture Sr2+. This result opens up a new way to design and synthesize inorganic ionic exchangers for the selective removal of Sr2+ ions from radioactive waste water.

         <title>Backside versus Frontside SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Triflates and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One way or another! Our quantum chemical calculations show how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the backside SN2 pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual frontside SN2 substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles in substitution reactions with alkyl triflates.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitution reactions are elementary reactions in organic chemistry that are used in many synthetic routes. By quantum chemical methods, we have investigated the intrinsic competition between the backside SN2 (SN2&#8208;b) and frontside SN2 (SN2&#8208;f) pathways using a set of simple alkyl triflates as the electrophile in combination with a systematic series of phenols and partially fluorinated ethanol nucleophiles. It is revealed how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the SN2&#8208;b pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual SN2&#8208;f substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles. Activation strain analyses disclose that the SN2&#8208;b pathway is favored for strong alcohol nucleophiles because of the well&#8208;known intrinsically more efficient approach to the electrophile resulting in a more stabilizing nucleophile&#8211;electrophile interaction. In contrast, the preference of weaker alcohol nucleophiles shifts to the SN2&#8208;f pathway, benefiting from a stabilizing hydrogen bond interaction between the incoming alcohol and the leaving group. This hydrogen bond interaction is strengthened by the increased acidity of the weaker alcohol nucleophiles, thereby steering the mechanistic preference toward the frontside SN2 pathway.

         <title>Prism[2]dihydrophenazines: Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, and Supramolecular Tessellation through Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of macrocyclic arenes (prism[2]dihydrophenazines) with tunable flexibility have been fabricated by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions between methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives of dihydrophenazine subunits and paraformaldehyde in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Cocrystallization of the flexible prism[2]dihydrophenazine with the electron&#8208;deficient guest tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone resulted in regular parallelogram&#8208;like supramolecular tessellation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic arenes have gained considerable attention for their structural diversity and widespread applications. In this research, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes, namely prism[2]dihydrophenazines (anti&#8208;P2P20, syn&#8208;P2P20, and P2P22), composed of two dihydrophenazine derivatives subunits bridged by methylene groups, were conveniently synthesized by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot condensation in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Both anti&#8208;P2P20 and its isomer syn&#8208;P2P20 exhibited flexible and convertible conformation with narrow cavity, while P2P22 possessed rigid and rhombic&#8208;like skeleton due to the more steric hindrance on subunits. In addition, the selection of electron&#8208;deficient guest was found to influence the outside binding behavior of syn&#8208;P2P20.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of macrocyclic arenes (prism[2]dihydrophenazines) with tunable flexibility have been fabricated by AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed Friedel-Crafts reactions between methyl-substituted derivatives of dihydrophenazine subunits and paraformaldehyde in 1,2-dichloroethane. Cocrystallization of the flexible prism[2]dihydrophenazine with the electron-deficient guest tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone resulted in regular parallelogram-like supramolecular tessellation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrocyclic arenes have gained considerable attention for their structural diversity and widespread applications. In this research, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes, namely prism[2]dihydrophenazines (&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;P2P20&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;syn-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P2P20&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;P2P22&lt;/b&gt;), composed of two dihydrophenazine derivatives subunits bridged by methylene groups, were conveniently synthesized by AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed one-pot condensation in 1,2-dichloroethane. Both &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;P2P20&lt;/b&gt; and its isomer &lt;i&gt;syn-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P2P20&lt;/b&gt; exhibited flexible and convertible conformation with narrow cavity, while &lt;b&gt;P2P22&lt;/b&gt; possessed rigid and rhombic-like skeleton due to the more steric hindrance on subunits. In addition, the selection of electron-deficient guest was found to influence the outside binding behavior of &lt;i&gt;syn-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P2P20&lt;/b&gt;. Fantastic regular supramolecular tessellation was fabricated by tiling of &lt;i&gt;syn-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P2P20&lt;/b&gt; with tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone (&lt;b&gt;TFB&lt;/b&gt;) through the exo-wall interactions. Using 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (&lt;b&gt;DFN&lt;/b&gt;) as a linker, only the regular 2D network superstructure with periodic units in a plane was obtained through cocrystallization. This work not only reports the construction of supramolecular tessellations by using prism[2]dihydrophenazines as building blocks, but also provides a new perspective for the design of macrocyclic arenes and fabrication of 2D supramolecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction for the Synthesis of Diindolylmethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation &#8211; organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes is presented. The synthesis of 21&#8197;derivatives with overall yields of up to 85&#8201;% showed that we were able to expand the range of readily accessible diidolylmethanes while demonstrating the utility of our presented method.







Abstract
Herein, we present an efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes. Classic syntheses have relied on (Lewis) acid activation of aldehydes, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive in handling. In contrast, the combination of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and subsequent organocatalytic activation of the in&#8208;situ formed aldehydes allows the use of readily available and stable alkenes with various functional groups while avoiding acidic conditions to expand the range of available diindolylmethanes. A broad scope of diindolylmethanes was prepared in yields up to 85&#8201;% demonstrates the utility of the presented method.

         <title>Reversibly Tuning the Viscosity of Peptide&#8208;Based Solutions Using Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8211;switchable merocyanine photoacid has been used to induce reversible pH drops during the assembly of the modified dipeptide molecule 1ThNapFF. As the pH is decreased, protonation of 1ThNapFF leads to increased aggregation and increased viscosity. These reversible viscosity changes can be used to design systems where flow can be controlled in a non&#8211;invasive and localised way.







Abstract
Light can be used to design stimuli&#8211;responsive systems. We induce transient changes in the assembly of a low molecular weight gelator solution using a merocyanine photoacid. Through our approach, reversible viscosity changes can be achieved via irradiation, delivering systems where flow can be controlled non&#8208;invasively on demand.

         <title>Effect of Benzo&#8208;Annelation on Triplet State Energies in Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbons&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a series of earlier studies, the effect of benzo&#8208;annelation was found to be a useful tool for tuning the aromaticity in polycyclic conjugated compounds to desired level. In this work we studied the (anti)aromaticity of benzo&#8208;annelated derivatives of three conjugated hydrocarbons (anthracene, fluoranthene and biphenylene) in their lowest lying singlet (S0) and triplet (T1) states by means of the energy effect (ef), harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), multicentre delocalization indices (MCI), magnetically induced current densities (MICDs) and nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS). We showed that benzo&#8208;annelation is a topology&#8208;based effect which can be used to modify the T1 state excitation energies (E(T1)). A quantitative model was established being able to accurately predict the E(T1) based only on the numbers of angularly, linearly and geminally annelated benzene rings. In addition, it was demonstrated that the E(T1) can be directly related to the (anti)aromatic character of the central ring in the studied molecules in their S0 state.</dc:description>

         <title>20&#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Benziphthalocyanines with Absorption Reaching the Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1500 nm) light has attracted considerable attention, especially for life sciences applications, the development of organic dyes with NIR&#8208;II absorption remains a formidable challenge. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and electronic properties of 20&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines (BPcs) that exhibit intense absorption bands in the NIR region. The strong, low&#8208;energy absorption of the antiaromatic BPcs is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transitions with narrow band gaps, enabled by the reduced structural symmetry of BPc compared with regular porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The combination of peripheral substituents and a central metal decreases the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the extension of the absorption bands into the NIR&#8208;II region (reaching 1100 nm) under reductive conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Functional Groups in Carbon for Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed great research interests in developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8211;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that enables the sustainable and flexible synthesis of H2O2. Carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts exhibit attractive catalytic performance for the 2e&#8211; ORR, where oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) play a decisive role. However, current understanding is far from adequate, and the contribution of OFGs to the catalytic performance remains controversial. Therefore, a critical overview on OFGs in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8211; ORR is highly desirable. Herein, we go over the methods for constructing OFGs in carbon including chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, and precursor inheritance. Then we review the roles of OFGs in activating carbon toward the 2e&#8211; ORR, focusing on the intrinsic activity of different OFGs and the interplay between OFGs and metal species or defects. At last, we discuss the reasons for inconsistencies among different studies, and personal perspectives on the future development in this field are provided. The results provide insights into the origin of high catalytic activity and selectivity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8211; ORR and would provide theoretical foundations for the future development in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition of Amino Acid Salts by Temperature&#8208;Dependent Allosteric Binding with Stereodynamic Urea Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positive homotropic artificial allosteric systems are important for the regulation of cooperativity, selectivity and nonlinear amplification. Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors can transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first ligand binding to axial chirality between two chromophores. We herein report stereodynamic allosteric urea receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites. NMR titration experiments revealed that the receptor can bind two carboxylate guests in a positive homotropic allosteric manner attributed to the inactivation by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between urea units within the receptor. In addition, the VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding of the urea receptor with L&#8208; or D&#8208;amino acid salts in MeCN showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects, based on the differences of the receptor shaft unit and the guest structure. The successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acid salts indicated that the input of chiral and steric information for the guest was amplified as outputs of the Cotton effect and the temperature&#8208;dependence of VT&#8208;CD spectra through cooperativity of positive allosteric binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free selective synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes and formaldehyde catalyzed by dimethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated aldehydes are important building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers. The synthesis of these molecules from cheap feedstocks such as alkenes remains a scientific challenge, mainly due to the low reactivity of alkenes. Here we report a selective and metal&#8208;free access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes with formaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by dimethylamine and affords &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in yields of up to 80%. By combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, we elucidate the reaction mechanism which is based on a cascade of hydride transfer, hydrolysis and aldolization reactions. The reaction can be performed under very mild conditions (30&#8208;50&#160;&#176;C), in a theoretically 100% carbon&#8208;economical fashion, with water as the only by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully applied to non&#8208;activated linear 1&#8208;alkenes, thus opening an access to industrially relevant &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from cheap and widely abundant chemicals at large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Azetidine&#8208;Containing Small Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are increasingly important structures in drugs but their development can be impeded by difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here, we introduce the 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) subunit as a new turn&#8208;inducing element for the efficient synthesis of small head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclic peptides. Greatly improved cyclizations of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexapeptides (28 examples) under standard reaction conditions are achieved by introduction of this element within the linear peptide precursor. Post&#8208;cyclization deprotection of the amino acid side chains with strong acid is realized without degradation of the strained four&#8208;membered azetidine. An special feature of this chemistry is that further late&#8208;stage modification of the resultant macrocyclic peptides can be achieved via the 3&#8208;AAz unit.&#160;&#160;This is done by: (i) chemoselective deprotection and substitution at the azetidine nitrogen, or by (ii) a click&#8208;based approach employing a 2&#8208;propynyl carbamate on the azetidine nitrogen. In this way, a range of dye and biotin tagged macrocycles are readily produced. Structural insights gained by XRD analysis of a cyclic tetrapeptide indicate that the azetidine ring encourages access to the less stable, all&#8208;trans conformation. Moreover, introduction of a 3&#8208;AAz into a representative cyclohexapeptide improves stability towards proteases compared to the homodetic macrocycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction between bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane derivatives and nBuLi and various aldehydes, yielded novel neutral ligand precursors incorporating alcohol functional groups. The resulting compounds exhibited distinct characteristics depending on the steric hindrance of the aldehyde employed. In instances where aromatic aldehydes were utilized, functionalization occurred at the methine group bridging both triazole rings. Conversely, the use of pivalic aldehyde prompted functionalization at the C5 position of the triazole ring. These compounds were subsequently employed as ligand precursors in the synthesis of organometallic aluminum and zinc complexes, yielding dinuclear complexes with high efficiency. The structural elucidation of all compounds was accomplished through spectroscopic methods and validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Preliminary catalytic investigations into the coupling reaction of cyclohexene oxide and CO2 revealed that aluminum and zinc complexes catalyzed the selective formation of polyether and polycarbonate materials, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Capturing N&#8208;Methylbenzene Sulfonamide&#8208;Phenothiazine Incorporating Strong Electron Acceptor Push&#8208;Pull Systems: Photochemical Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of symmetrical and asymmetrical ynamide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores exhibiting strong intramolecular charge transfer have been designed, synthesized, and insight into their ultrafast carrier dynamics is investigated. Broadly tunable absorption extending even in the near&#8208;infrared region coupled with novel excited state dynamical processes brightens their prospect of utilization in advanced photonic applications.







Abstract
Unraveling the intriguing aspects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon of multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems are of paramount importance considering their promising applications, particularly in solar energy harvesting and light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores 1&#8211;6, are designed and synthesized by the Corey&#8208;Fuchs reaction via Evano's condition followed by [2+2] cycloaddition retroelectrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction with strong electron acceptors TCNE and TCNQ in good yields (~60&#8211;85&#8201;%). The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ) with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor. An additional low&#8208;lying broad absorption band extended towards the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region suggests charge polarization after the introduction of the electron acceptors in both symmetrical and asymmetrical systems, leading to such strong ICT bands. The electrochemical properties reveal that reduction potentials of 3 and 6 are lower than those of 2 and 5, suggesting DCNQ imparts more on the electronic properties and hence largely contributes to the stabilization of LUMO energy levels than TCBD, in line with theoretical observations. Relative positions of the frontier orbitals on geometry&#8208;optimized structures further support accessing donor&#8208;acceptor sites responsible for the ICT transitions. Eventually, ultrafast carrier dynamics of the photoinduced species are investigated by femtosecond transient absorption studies to identify their spectral characteristics and target analysis further provides information about different excited states photophysical events including ICT and their associated time profiles. The key findings obtained here related to excited state dynamical processes of these newly synthesized systems are believed to be significant in advancing their prospect of utilization in solar energy conversion and related photonic applications.

The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ) with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor.
