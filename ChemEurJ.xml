         <title>Structure&#8208;Binding Relationship of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthyridine Dimers: Role of Linkage Positions on DNA and RNA Recognition</title>

Altering the connecting positions of two 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine units modulates binding to distinct DNA and RNA motifs. This structural variation influences molecular interactions, affecting stacking tendencies and hydrogen bonding. The positional differences determine how these molecules recognize cytosine&#8208;rich sequences, impacting their ability to stabilize nucleic acid structures and paving the way for designing RNA&#8208;targeted small molecules.







Abstract
The study explores the synthesis, structural analysis, and binding properties of eight analogs of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine dimers (ANPxys) targeting DNA and RNA. These dimers, derived from ANP77, are connected at varying positions to investigate how positional alterations influence molecular conformations and their interactions with nucleic acids. The primary focus lies on evaluating the effects of these structural variations on DNA and RNA binding through fluorescence quenching and thermal denaturation assays. Absorption and fluorescence measurements revealed distinct electronic states for ANPxys, with emission maxima between 389.5 and 398.5&#8197;nm. Conformational analysis indicated that most ANPxys adopt unstacked conformations in aqueous solutions, though some, like ANP47 and ANP67, showed higher probabilities of stacked conformations. Thermal denaturation studies demonstrated ANPxys bind and stabilize cytosine&#8208;rich DNA motifs with varying affinities, with ANP77 showing the strongest effects. RNA binding studies targeting U/CC motifs across 256 sequences revealed unique fluorescence quenching patterns for each ANPxy, reflecting sequence specificity. Hierarchical clustering grouped ANPxys into parallel&#8208;stacked and twisted&#8208;stacked clusters, correlating their conformations with binding preferences. This work highlights the critical role of connection positions in determining ANPxy binding specificity and conformational behavior. The findings provide a basis for designing small molecules with tunable structures and enhanced RNA&#8208;binding capabilities, paving the way for the development of RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutics.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Evolution Catalyzed by Co(II) Complexes of N5&#8208;Donor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt(II) complexes of three related pentadentate ligands have been investigated as photoelectrochemical catalysts for proton reduction/hydrogen gas evolution in the presence of ruthenium, iridium, or copper&#8208;based photosensitizers. Potential mechanisms for hydrogen evolution have been investigated by time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and computational modelling.







Abstract
Three new cobalt complexes of the general formula [Co(II)(L)(CH3CN) ]2+, where L is one of three pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;donor ligands based on the N4Py framework, have been synthesized and characterized. The capacity of the three complexes to effect photocatalytic proton reduction has been examined. Their photocatalytic activities in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, acting as a photosensitizer, and ascorbic acid, acting as a sacrificial electron donor, were screened in a water/acetonitrile mixture. The photochemical mechanism, as revealed by nanosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, involves reaction of the excited sensitizer with ascorbic acid to yield [Ru(bpy)3]+ as a primary photogenerated reductant, capable of electron transfer to the cobalt catalyst(s). Under the experimental conditions used, partial decomposition of both the sensitizer and the catalyst is the main deactivation channel for photocatalysis. Optimization of reaction conditions indicated that the use of more reducing iridium or copper&#8208;based photosensitizers had a beneficial effect on the catalytic performance. The effect of the different ligands on the catalytic activities of the corresponding cobalt complexes have been investigated by DFT calculations.

An umpolung and inverse conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides or esters with BrCF2CO2R and halogen nucleophilic reagents via a photocatalytically generated &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocation, producing diverse biologically important &#945;&#8208;halo substituted 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic derivatives.







Abstract
Here, we disclose a halogen &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition via photocatalytic oxidation of the in&#8208;situ generated &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical of amides or esters to corresponding &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cation. The &#945;&#8208;carbon radical is generated by the &#946;&#8208;addition of difluoroalkyl radical, formed by the photocatalytic reduction of BrCF2CO2R, to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides/esters. This umpolung strategy enables an efficient three&#8208;component difluoroalkyl&#8208;halogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides or esters with BrCF2CO2R and Cl/F&#8208;nucleophiles to produce diverse biologically important CF2&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208;1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic derivatives under mild conditions.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hydroquinolines from Nitroaldehydes and Ketones by Hydrogenation Sequences and Condensations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a novel complex chemical reaction namely the synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes and ketones and hydrogen. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed condensation leading to a quinoline intermediate and selective quinoline hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic reaction discovery or methodology development is preferably performed with homogeneous catalysts, but heterogeneous catalysts allow the design of complex multistep syntheses based on their reusability. We introduce here the catalytic synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes, ketones and hydrogen. The reaction is complex and proceeds via multiple selective hydrogenation and condensation steps. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed Friedl&#228;nder synthesis and selective quinoline hydrogenation. The starting materials are inexpensive, simple regarding their structure and diversely available, and the hydroquinoline motif is part of numerous biologically active compounds. A nanostructured earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst mediates our reaction most efficiently.

         <title>Cover Feature: Supergelation via Weak Interactions: An Efficient Method for the Fabrication of Hydrophobic Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral hydrophobic supergelators exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence were developed by using a host&#8211;guest approach. The colour of the chiral light emission was tuned by incorporating luminophores emitting at specific wavelengths. The resulting composite supergels, being highly stable and water repellent, have the potential to be used in the fabrication of optoelectronic and light emitting devices. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Kumar and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500646).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of lanthanoid species with carbodiimides (RN=C=NR) show considerable variety. Thus, treatment of divalent, [Sm(OArEt)2(thf)3]&#183;PhMe with carbodiimides of differing steric bulk resulted in the formation of an oxalamidinatosamarium(III) complex or a formamidinatosamarium(III) complex. Reactions between Yb/Eu metals with bis(phenylethynyl)mercury and N,N'&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide yielded trivalent (Yb) and divalent (Eu) C&#8208;phenylethynylamidinate complexes. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#160;C. Junk and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500759). The authors acknowledge Thimira Jayasari for help with the artwork.

This review provides an overview of recent advancements in MOF&#8722;based dual&#8722;atom catalysts (DACs) for CO2 reduction. It covers strategies for designing MOF&#8722;DACs, their role in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the influence of dual&#8722;metal synergistic catalysis on catalytic performance for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
In recent years, the development of efficient catalysts for photo&#8722;/electro&#8722;catalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has become a major research focus due to growing environmental concerns and energy demands. Dual&#8722;atom catalysts (DACs), composed of two metal atoms with suitable metal&#8722;metal distance integrated into the supports, have shown great promise in enhancing catalytic performance via the dual&#8722;metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) effect. This review highlights the advancements in Metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8722;based DACs, which combine the high atomic efficiency of DACs with tunable and defined structures and high metal loadings. In this review, we summarized the recent developments on the synthesis strategies of MOF&#8722;based DACs and their applications in CO2RR, focusing on the role of DMSC effect in improving catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. Additionally, we also discuss the influence of the local electronic structure, coordination environment, and metal atom interactions on catalytic performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of MOF&#8722;based DACs and offers insights into their future potential in sustainable energy conversion.

This review discusses cutting&#8208;edge sorbents emphasizing on material design with critical evaluation of performance metrics, limitations, and future possibilities, establishing a robust foundation for advancing scalable DAC technologies and contributing to global efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality.








Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) is of immense current interest, as a means to facilitate CO2 capture at low concentrations (&#8764;400&#160;ppm) directly from the atmosphere, with the aim of addressing global warming caused by excessive anthropogenic CO2 production. Traditionally, DAC of CO2 has relied on amine scrubbing and metal carbonate /hydroxide solutions. However, recent years have seen notable progress in DAC sorbents, with key advancements aimed at improving efficiency, capacity, and regenerability while reducing energy consumption. This review delivers an exhaustive analysis of contemporary developments in DAC sorbents, addressing the innovations in material design and consequent performance enhancement. The limitations of the sorbents have also been discussed, with future perspectives for improving sustainable CO2 capture strategies. We anticipate that this overview will help lay the groundwork for further development and large&#8208;scale implementation of sustainable sorbents and cutting&#8208;edge technologies toward attaining carbon neutrality.

COFs exhibit great potential in photocatalysis for energy production and environmental remediation. This review highlights their advancements in hydrogen production, hydrogen peroxide generation, uranium extraction, carbon dioxide reduction and antibiotic degradation, emphasizing their mechanisms, structure&#8208;performance relationships, and future challenges.







Abstract
Photocatalytic technology has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its significant potential in environmental protection and energy conversion. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel class of porous materials, demonstrate remarkable photocatalytic performance owing to their high surface areas, tunable pore sizes, permanent porosities, and customizable functionalities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of COFs in photocatalysis. In energy&#8208;related applications, COFs effectively catalyze hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, and uranium (U(VI)) extraction from seawater, thereby offering new avenues for sustainable energy generation.

&lt;p&gt;COFs exhibit great potential in photocatalysis for energy production and environmental remediation. This review highlights their advancements in hydrogen production, hydrogen peroxide generation, uranium extraction, carbon dioxide reduction and antibiotic degradation, emphasizing their mechanisms, structure-performance relationships, and future challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic technology has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its significant potential in environmental protection and energy conversion. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel class of porous materials, demonstrate remarkable photocatalytic performance owing to their high surface areas, tunable pore sizes, permanent porosities, and customizable functionalities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of COFs in photocatalysis. In energy-related applications, COFs effectively catalyze hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation, and uranium (U(VI)) extraction from seawater, thereby offering new avenues for sustainable energy generation. In environmental remediation, COFs exploit photocatalytic properties to reduce carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions and degrade antibiotics in wastewater, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas mitigation and the enhancement of water quality. The review further explores the underlying mechanisms of COFs in photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation, U(VI) reduction, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, and antibiotic degradation, emphasizing the pivotal role of the COF structure in governing photocatalytic performance. Nevertheless, challenges persist concerning the stability, catalytic efficiency, and scalability of COFs. Future research should prioritize optimizing synthesis methods, tuning structural features, and enhancing the stability and performance of COFs to facilitate their practical applications.

         <dc:description>
The properties of liquid water were investigated along the isobar of 25&#160;MPa from ambient to near&#8208;critical temperatures, using molecular dynamics simulations. Noticeable changes in the shape of the radial distribution functions, in several structural order parameters and entropic quantities, as well as in the reorientational and HB dynamics were observed around 423.15 K and 498.15 K.








Abstract
The properties of high&#8208;pressure liquid water were investigated along the isobar of 25&#160;MPa and in the temperature range 298.15&#8208;623.15 K using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Particular attention has been given to the changes in the local structural and related dynamic properties of liquid water. The results obtained have revealed noticeable changes in the shape of the calculated radial distribution functions, as well as the existence of local extrema or crossovers in several structural descriptors and entropic quantities at temperatures around 423.15 K and 498.15 K, where also significant changes in the hydrogen bond network of liquid water have also been observed. The temperature dependence of translational, reorientational, and hydrogen bond dynamics of liquid water has also been investigated by calculating the translational self&#8208;diffusion and the corresponding O&#8208;H vector Legendre reorientational correlation times and hydrogen bond lifetimes. The corresponding activation energies for each investigated relaxation process have also been presented and discussed.

         <title>Homogeneous Coating of Al&#8208;Doped Spinel Oxides on Ni Mesh for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immersion&#8208;infrared drying&#8208;calcination method enables scale&#8208;up preparation and maintains homogeneity for the NiAl0.5Co1.5O4 electrode, which exhibits superior performance for oxygen evolution reaction. The Al doping modulates the intrinsic electronic configuration and induces metal&#8208;oxygen bond contraction to improve the electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Industrial alkaline water electrolysis requires a catalyst electrode with high alkaline resistance and scalability due to the high alkaline concentration, frequent gas desorption, and high hydrogen production power involved. However, most high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are poorly adhered to conductive substrates, such as nickel foam or carbon paper, leading to detachment and performance degradation under harsh industrial conditions. Here, we report a simple and scalable strategy of &#8220;immersion&#8208;infrared drying&#8208;calcination&#8221; to fabricate Al&#8208;doped spinel oxides in situ grown on mechanically robust Ni mesh. By further simple cation substitution, we effectively modulate the metal&#8208;oxygen bond length in the octahedral center and the valence state of active sites, significantly enhancing OER activity. Electrochemical tests (1 M KOH, 25&#176;C) show that NiAl0.5Co1.5O4 exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 234&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, under industrial conditions (6 M KOH, 60&#176;C), it achieves an overpotential of only 448&#160;mV at a current density of 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is superior to that of commercial Raney Ni catalysts. Moreover, the scalable electrode demonstrates excellent resistance to concentrated alkaline solutions and high current densities.

         <title>Polyacrylamide&#8208;Grafted MXenes Prepared via on&#8208;Surface Polymerization Demonstrated Enhanced Aqueous Dispersion and Colloidal Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble initiator was introduced onto the surface of the Ti3C2 MXenes via diazonium chemistry and used to initiate atom transfer radical polymerization to graft a bunch of hydrophilic polymers. The introduction of polymer bunch endowed the MXenes with sufficient stability and dispersity in biological media without attenuating their photothermal conversion capacities which made them hold great application potentials for biomedical sciences.








Abstract
As a novel type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes demonstrated great potential for biomedical applications due to their excellent photothermal and photodynamic properties. However, their exposed unmodified surface cannot ensure sufficient stability for MXene in a biological environment. Here, we developed an efficient method to modify the surface of MXenes in aqueous medium. A water&#8208;soluble initiator was designed and covalently anchored onto MXene surfaces, which was used to initiate copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization to introduce a layer of water&#8208;soluble polyacrylamide on MXene surfaces (PAM&#8208;MXenes). Impressively, it was found that the grafting of the polymer layer on MXene surfaces greatly enhanced the colloidal stability of modified MXenes which remained well dispersed in cell culture medium for over 7 days and for over one month in water without aggregation or sedimentation. Furthermore, their photothermal properties were not influenced as the PAM&#8208;MXenes demonstrated uncompromised heat&#8208;generating capacities upon irradiation at 808&#160;nm nor did they cause marked toxicity to cells. Thus, our work provided an effective approach to ameliorate the surface properties of MXene materials.

         <dc:description>
Twisted aromatic amine cages are well known in the literature for a wide array of applications including catalysis, sensing, imaging, etc. In this work, we report the first example of amine cages with the capacity to exhibit two&#8208;step light&#8208;harvesting behavior. The aforementioned property was further utilized to achieve anticounterfeiting properties.








Abstract
A new platinum (II)&#8208;triphenylamine tetra aldehyde&#8208;based barrel&#8208;shaped rectangular covalent cage was prepared using dynamic imine condensation and subsequent reduction. The cage was found to exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in 60% water in THF solvent composition and the AIE property was successively utilized to achieve excellent sequential light&#8208;harvesting behavior in aggregate form in the presence of acceptors such as Eosin Y and Nile Red. Moreover, the light&#8208;harvesting capability was employed to prepare a new type of security ink whose potential was demonstrated using TLC plates and commercial banknotes.

         <title>Chlorosulfenic Acid: An Important Linker in the Coupled Sulfur and Chlorine Chemistry in the Venusian Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive chlorosulfenic acid (HOSCl) has been synthesized in the gas phase and spectroscopically characterized. The photochemistry of HOSCl reveals that it is very likely involved in the Venus&#8217; atmosphere, where its photofragments hydrogen chloride (HCl) and sulfur monoxide (SO) are known as abundant reactive chlorine and sulfur gases, respectively.








Abstract
The coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry plays an important role in the chemical cycle of the Venusian atmosphere. However, the reactivity of sulfur monoxide (SO) toward hydrochloric acid (HCl), two abundant reactive gases in the Venusian atmosphere remains hitherto unknown. In this work, we report the generation, spectroscopic characterization, and photochemistry of chlorosulfenic acid (HOSCl), a simple molecule that acts not only as a potential candidate for the near&#8208;UV absorber but also as an important linker in the coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry in the Venusian atmosphere. This molecule has bright absorption from 330 to 440&#160;nm. The photochemistry of HOSCl at 365&#160;nm yields SO and HCl as a novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular complex in a cryogenic Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K, and the subsequent irradiation at 193&#160;nm leads to recombination of the two fragments by reformation of HOSCl. The photochemistry of HOSCl underscores its importance in the photochemical models of the sulfur and chlorine species in Venusian atmosphere.

Bis(germylenes) 5&#8211;9 and bis(germacarbonyl) compounds 10&#8211;12, which exhibit stability in air and water, have been isolated for the first time. This accomplishment was made possible by the stabilization offered by the bulky bis(dipyrromethene) ligand framework.








Abstract
The first examples of air and water stable bis(germylenes) 5&#8211;9 and bis(germacarbonyl) compounds 10&#8211;12 are reported. Bis(germylene monochloride) 5 is isolated by starting from bis(dipyrromethene) 4, which in turn has been synthesized by oxidizing bis(dipyrromethane) 3 using DDQ. Terephthaldehyde 1 and mesityl pyrrole 2 were the precursors for compound 3. Bis(germylene monochloride) 5 reacts with alcohols and phenol in the presence of a mild base (Cs&#8322;CO&#8323;) to afford bis(germylene alkoxides) 6&#8211;7 and bis(germylene phenoxide) 8, respectively. Compound 5&#8242;s reaction with sodium pyrrolide has resulted in bis(germylene pyrrolide) 9. Further, compounds 7 and 9 react with elemental sulfur and selenium under ambient conditions, resulting in bis(germacarbonyl) compounds 10&#8211;12. The UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic investigations on compounds 4&#8211;12 are done experimentally and computationally.

         <title>Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of an Adaptive Ni Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with 1D Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D [Ni(L&#8208;cam)(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpe)]n with 1D helical chains exhibits a highly anisotropic thermal expansion behavior, which is associated with the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion of the 1D helical chains and the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe. This study deepens our comprehension of the NTE of 3D MOFs and offers new strategies for the molecular design of novel NTE materials.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually becoming an ideal platform for investigating negative thermal expansion (NTE) owing to their designability and framework flexibility. In this work, we studied the thermal expansion (TE) phenomenon of the orthorhombic [Ni(L&#8208;cam)(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpe)]n (L&#8208;cam = L&#8208;camphoric acid and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpe = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine) with 1D helical chains through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;PXRD), and variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;SCXRD). The synergistic effect of the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe and the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion elucidated the mechanism of NTE along the c&#8208;axis. The positive thermal expansion (PTE) along the b&#8208;axis can be attributed to the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion of the helical chains. The a&#8208;axis was nearly unchanged, exhibiting zero thermal expansion (ZTE). The PTE happened in the unit cell volume due to the larger deformation along the b&#8208;axis compared to the c&#8208;axis. This study deepens our comprehension of the NTE of 3D MOFs and provides a point of view for the design and synthesis in the development and investigation of other NTE materials.

         <title>Preassembly&#8208;Controlled Radical Recombination at Bismuth: Decarboxylative C&#9472;N Coupling with Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical processes involving bismuth hold great potential, but innovative strategies are required to control the reactivity of bismuth intermediates. Herein, we report a direct photochemical decarboxylation with molecular bismuth for C&#9472;N coupling of benzylic carboxylic acids and sulfonamides. While highly reactive and hard&#8208;to&#8208;control bismuth radicals are formed, preassembly exerts control over the reaction outcome.








Abstract
Persistent transition metal radicals form the foundation for many metallaphotoredox protocols. Their ability to efficiently trap organic radicals and convert them into various coupling products has inspired the exploration of selective radical reactions even beyond the d&#8208;block. Radical processes involving bismuth hold great potential, but innovative strategies are required to control the reactivity of bismuth intermediates. Herein, we report preassembly as a powerful strategy to enforce a selective recombination of a bismuth(II) radical and an organic radical. As a result, an inner&#8208;sphere pathway is accessed, enabling the formation of C&#9472;N coupling products.

         <title>A Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Radiotheranostic Agent for Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator in Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three cyclic peptide&#8208;based radioligands for uPA&#8208;targeted theranostics are designed, synthesized, and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Outperforming the clinically used [64Cu]DOTA&#8208;AE105, [64Cu]CAP&#8208;1 exhibits enhanced tumor uptake and reduced off&#8208;target accumulation in tumor model mice. In addition, mice treated with [64Cu]CAP&#8208;1 exhibit significant tumor growth inhibition. These findings indicate the potential of cyclic peptide&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals for uPA&#8208;targeting theranostics.








Abstract
The plasminogen activator system is critically involved in tumor progression regulation. Aberrant activation of urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) induces proteolytic degradation of cellular membranes and the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Consequently, uPA has emerged as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target. Herein, we designed and evaluated three cyclic peptide&#8208;based radioligands ([&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;2, and [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;3) as potential PET tracers for uPA visualization in mouse tumor models, assessing their binding ability, specificity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Among them, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, featuring a native disulfide bond, emerged as the optimal candidate. This radioligand demonstrated superior tumor uptake and reduced hepatic accumulation compared to the clinically advanced uPAR&#8208;targeted tracer [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]DOTA&#8208;AE105, currently in Phase 2 trials. A single administration of [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 (2 mCi/mouse) significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mouse models. These findings position [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 as a potent radiotheranostic agent for uPA&#8208;overexpressing tumors, offering a novel strategy for precision targeting of the uPA/uPAR axis.

&lt;p&gt;Three cyclic peptide-based radioligands for uPA-targeted theranostics are designed, synthesized, and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;The plasminogen activator system is critically involved in tumor progression regulation. Aberrant activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) induces proteolytic degradation of cellular membranes and the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor invasion and metastasis.

         <title>A Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Ratiometric Sensor for Detection of Anions in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent chemosensors that respond to anions via vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) have emerged as powerful tools to identify and quantify closely related species. However, VIE&#8208;based anion sensors have been limited to use in non&#8208;competitive organic solvents. Here, we introduce a VIE&#8208;based sensor, ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC, that provides a highly sensitive ratiometric response to quantify citrate and phosphate anions in aqueous solvent mixtures.








Abstract
Sensors that respond to anions via vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) have recently emerged as effective tools for discrimination between closely related carboxylate species in non&#8208;competitive, organic solvents. However, the utility of this sensing mechanism has not yet been demonstrated for anions in aqueous media. Here, we prepared two sensors, monoZnDPA&#8208;DPAC and ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC, with either one or two anion&#8208;binding motifs. These systems are capable of binding to anions in water. Dual emission via VIE is maintained in solvent mixtures of up to 70% water. ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC provides a unique, ratiometric response to citrate and phosphate, which was used for the accurate quantification of aqueous solutions of these anions.

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes Supported by a Functionalized PC(sp3)P Pincer Ligand: Properties and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of interconvertible high&#8208;valent nickel complexes supported by a rigid pincer ligand is described. The nickel center exhibits remarkable stability and predictable coordination in oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. Notably, the Ni(III) complex functions as an efficient and selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkenes.








Abstract
This article presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of robust high&#8208;valent organometallic nickel (Ni) complexes stabilized by a functionalized PC(sp3)P pincer ligand. Notably, the nickel center, covalently confined within the 3D ligand framework, demonstrates predictable coordination and redox behavior, coupled with remarkable stability across oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. These states were found to interconvert via one&#8208;electron transfer reactions. Among these complexes, the Ni(III)&#8208;PC(sp3)P species was identified as an efficient catalyst for the mild and selective hydrosilylation of alkenes, operating through a nonoxidative reaction mechanism.

         <title>Supergelation via Weak Interactions: An Efficient Method for the Fabrication of Hydrophobic Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral hydrophobic supergelators were developed using a host&#8211;guest approach. Incorporation of non&#8208;polar chromophores into a chiral gel led to the fabrication of composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with tunable properties. The sign of chiral emission was governed by the optical activity of the gel, whereas the wavelength of chiral luminescence was controlled by the fluorophore emission.








Abstract
The hydroxylated derivative of stearic acid, 12&#8208;hydroxy stearic acid (12&#8208;HSA), is derived from castor oil and possesses a unique chemical structure that renders it noteworthy in the field of cosmetics and medicine. Being derived from renewable sources, it aligns with the growing demand for sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly material. While the gelation properties of 12&#8208;HSA are known, its chiroptical properties remain unexplored. Herein, a host&#8211;guest approach is adopted for the induction of optical activity in achiral chromophores using 12&#8208;HSA as a chiral template. The induction of optical activity from the host gelator to the guest chromophores resulted in the generation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from hybrid nanocomposites. This strategy was effective in generation of chiral luminescence in non&#8208;polar chromophores, a class of molecules unexplored in CPL. The use of red&#8208; and blue&#8208;emitting chromophores led to the fabrication of chiral light&#8208;emitting materials in the respective spectral range. The structural attributes of the gelator imparted hydrophobic character to the co&#8208;assembled nanostructures. The robustness of the nanocomposites helped derive self&#8208;standing chiral luminescent soft materials of desired sizes and shapes. The readily available raw materials and ease of operation make this an effective approach for the fabrication of CPL active materials for diverse applications.

         <title>Liquid PEG and PEGDA as Protective Matrices for TTA&#8208;UC Functioning in Air and Their Application in Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photochemically deoxygenating compounds, PEG&#8208;200 and PEGDA&#8208;575, have been used as solvents for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion in air, with both serving as sensitized singlet oxygen scavengers. A high&#8208;level information encryption platform has been developed using Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575 or Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575/PEG&#8208;200 ink that enables data to be read under specific light or at a certain time and erased by light exposure.








Abstract
Photochemical deoxygenation offers a promising solution to the oxygen sensitivity issue in Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC). This study utilized polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;200 and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA)&#8208;575 as solvents and singlet oxygen scavengers for TTA&#8208;UC conducted in air. The upconversion efficiency of Pt(OEP)/DPA in aerated PEG&#8208;200 is similar to that in nitrogen&#8208;saturated PEG&#8208;200. Prolonged 532&#160;nm light irradiation causes a PEGDA&#8208;575 solution of Pt(OEP)/DPA to undergo photoinitiated polymerization via homomolecular TTA, leading to a reduction in DPA's upconversion emission and an increase in Pt(OEP)&#8217;s phosphorescence. These results enabled the development of a high&#8208;level information encryption platform using the direct&#8208;writing method with Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575 or Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575/PEG&#8208;200 ink. The information is only readable under certain lighting conditions or at specific times and can be erased by exposure to light.

         <title>Making and Breaking Supramolecular Synthons for Modular Protein Frameworks</title>

Calixarenes are useful tools for protein crystal engineering. With the model protein RSL, different calixarene dimers generate distinct frameworks. An N&#8208;terminal macrocycle binding tag serves to expand the structural landscape.








Abstract
Anionic calixarenes are useful mediators of protein assembly. In some cases, protein &#8211; calixarene cocrystallization yields multiple polymorphs. Ralstonia solanacearum lectin (RSL) cocrystallizes with p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[8]arene (sclx8) in at least four distinct pH&#8208;dependent arrangements. One of these polymorphs, occurring at pH &#8804; 4, is a cubic framework in which RSL nodes are connected by sclx8 dimers. These dimers are supramolecular synthons that occur in distinct crystal structures. Now, we show that the discus&#8208;shaped dimer of p&#8208;phosphonato&#8208;calix[6]arene (pclx6), can replace the sclx8 dimer yielding a new assembly of RSL. Remarkably, just one type of RSL &#8211; pclx6 cocrystal was formed, irrespective of pH or crystallization condition. These results with pclx6 contrast starkly with sclx8 and suggest that the calixarene type (e.g., phosphonate versus sulfonate) dictates the synthon durability, which in turn exerts control over protein assembly and polymorph selection. Breaking the pclx6 dimer required a mutant of RSL with an affinity tag for macrocycle binding. This highly accessible, dicationic site resulted in a significantly altered and porous framework with pclx6 (but not with sclx8). Experiments with ternary mixtures of RSL, pclx6, and sclx8 provide evidence of pH&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting. Thus, the &#8220;mix&#8208;and&#8208;match&#8221; of protein and supramolecular synthons is a promising approach to protein crystal engineering.

         <title>Coexistence of the Perfluorinated Cp* Anion With Oxidizing and Electrophilic Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluorinated Cp* [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is known for its unique ligand/counteranion switchability and is now introduced as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA). Its extraordinarily low nucleophilicity, combined with its pronounced oxidative stability, allows for the coexistence with reactive cations and the formation of unprecedented salts.








Abstract
The air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable perfluorinated Cp* [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is presented as a candidate for the vastly underexplored group of weakly coordinating carbanions (WCCAs). Its extreme electron deficiency, combined with the stabilization of the negative charge within an aromatic system, results in a low basicity, yielding a very weak coordination ability. As Cp anions usually possess a strongly pronounced carbanionic character, the perfluorinated Cp* resembles an extraordinary exception for both the WCA and Cp chemistry. However, the coordination ability remains ambivalent due to the substitution lability of many of its complexes, allowing for the formation of unique ligand&#8208;WCA switches. Due to the low reactivity, there is a need for new transfer reagents containing the perfluorinated Cp* in combination with reactive cations. Thus, we report the synthesis and complete characterization of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; salts with hydride&#8208;accepting [(C6H5)3C]+, valuable Ag(I) reagents, oxidizing [Fe(C5H5)2]+ or [N(p&#8208;C6H4Br)3]+ and Br&#248;nsted acidic [H(m,m&#8208;NC5H3F2)2]+. Notably, these unprecedented ion pairs are exclusively accessible and stabilized by the low coordination affinity and pronounced oxidative resistance of the perfluorinated Cp*.

Reactions of lanthanoid species with carbodiimides show considerable variety. Treatment of the divalent complex, [Sm(OArEt)2(thf)3] with N,N'&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrNCNiPr) resulted in the formation of the oxalamidinatosamarium(III) complex [(OArEt)&#8322;Sm(&#956;&#8208;C&#8322;N&#8324;iPr&#8324;)Sm(OArEt)&#8322;]&#183;2PhMe. In contrast, the use of the bulkier N,N'&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (CyNCNCy) led to the formation of a formamidinatosamarium(III) complex [Sm(OArEt)2(CyNC(H)NCy)(thf)2]&#183;2thf. Reactions between rare earth metals (RE = Yb, Eu) with Hg(PhCC)2 and N,N'&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (CyNCNCy) yielded trivalent [YbIII{CyNC(C&#8801;CPh)NCy}3]&#8901;2thf and divalent [Eu{CyNC(C&#8801;CPh)NCy}&#8322;(thf)&#8322;].

[Sm(OArEt)2(thf)3].PhMe was obtained from SmI2(thf)2 and the in situ generated potassium aryl oxide and is a five&#8208;coordinate monomer with a stereochemistry between trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal.

The nature of the central spacer and the topology of the chelator plays a crucial role in the stability of [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ OCTAPA derivatives relevant for radiopharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/90Y]Y3+ and [nat/177Lu]Lu3+ with the new acyclic chelator H4CHXOITAPA. This octadentate chelator forms nine&#8208;coordinated Y3+ and Lu3+ complexes thanks to the coordination of a water molecule, as demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray structure of [Y(HCHXOITAPA)(H2O)] and 1H, 13C, and 89Y NMR studies in solution. These complexes display slightly higher thermodynamic stabilities compared with those of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, reaching log KYL and log KLuL values of 21.24(5) and 21.96(1), respectively. Kinetic studies indicate that these complexes dissociate mainly through the spontaneous and proton&#8208;assisted pathways at pH 7.4. The chelator can be readily radiolabeled with [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ at room temperature in 10&#160;min. The radio&#8208;complexes are stable in human serum at 37 &#176;C, in contrast with the analogues of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, which experience significant dissociation under these conditions. Thus, the H4CHXOITAPA chelator represents the most promising candidate among the H4OCTAPA family for the development of 90Y&#8208; and 177Lu&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Negative Cooperativity in the UHRF1 TTD&#8208;PHD Dual Domain Masks the Contributions of Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions between Trimethyllysine and the TTD Aromatic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the comparative interaction of the UHRF1 TTD or dual domain (TTD&#8208;PHD) with a histone 3 tail containing trimethyllysine, Kme3, or its neutral isostere. We show that the TTD alone binds K9me3 via electrostatically tunable cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, whereas with the TTD&#8208;PHD, binding of R2 to the PHD dominates, demonstrating negative cooperativity and masking the electrostatic tunability of K9me3 binding.








Abstract
UHRF1 is a promising epigenetic target in oncology, but inhibitor development has proven challenging due to the interplay between its tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and plant homeodomain (PHD). The TTD binds trimethyllysine (Kme3) at position 9 while the PHD binds Arg at position 2 on histone 3. Herein, we report how the PHD influences TTD recognition of the histone 3 tail containing Kme3 (H3K9me3) versus its neutral isostere, tert&#8208;butyl norleucine (tBuNle). Our findings show that the dual domain binds both peptides equally, supporting tBuNle's potential for inhibitor development. However, unexpectedly, the binding mechanism of H3K9me3 differs between the single and dual domains. In the TTD alone, Kme3 is bound in the aromatic cage via electrostatically tunable cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, but in the dual domain, Kme3 binding is independent of electrostatics in the aromatic cage&#8212;an unprecedented observation. Computational studies suggest cation&#8208;&#960; interactions should contribute in both cases. The contrasting experimental and computational results point to an unusual example of negative chelate cooperativity: interactions between the histone and PHD mask the mechanism of TTD recognition of K9me3. This work underscores the complexity of histone post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) readout in multi&#8208;domain proteins and demonstrates the first example of a masked cation&#8208;&#960; interaction.

Four metal&#8208;free quasi&#8208;chain crystals&#8212;(C5H6NO)+(NO3)&#8208; (4HPN), (C5H6NO)+(HC2O4)&#8208; (4HPO), (C4N3H6)+(NO3)&#8208; (2APMN), and (C4N3H6)+(HC2O4)&#8208;&#183;H2O (2APMO)&#8212;exhibit both giant birefringence and wide bandgaps and were readily grown as centimeter&#8208;scale crystals via a mild aqueous solution approach.








Abstract
Birefringence, a vital property of anisotropic crystals, is indispensable for advanced optical technologies. Quasi&#8208;1D structures, with their inherent structural anisotropy, offer fertile ground for discovering materials with exceptional optical anisotropy. In this work, we report four metal&#8208;free quasi&#8208;1D crystals&#8212;(C5H6NO)+(NO3)&#8208;(4HPN), (C5H6NO)+(HC2O4)&#8208;(4HPO), (C4N3H6)+(NO3)&#8208;(2APMN), and (C4N3H6)+(HC2O4)&#8208;&#183;H2O (2APMO)&#8212;designed to feature pseudo&#8208;chain structures and grown as centimeter&#8208;scale crystals via a facile aqueous&#8208;solution method. These crystals display wide bandgaps (3.40&#8211;4.48&#160;eV) and exceptional birefringence, with calculated values up to 0.555@546&#160;nm and an experimental maximum of 0.597@546&#160;nm for 4HPN. The giant birefringence stems from their quasi&#8208;1D architectures, high&#8208;spatial density, and optimal arrangement of the birefringence&#8208;active groups (BAGs). This study highlights the promise of metal&#8208;free quasi&#8208;1D materials for next&#8208;generation miniaturized polarization optics and laser&#8208;driven applications.

         <title>A Reversible Nitroamino&#8208;Based Switch Modulates Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising nitroamino&#8208;based switch has been introduced into energetic compounds that can effectively coordinate twin crystals induced by hydrogen&#8208;bonding competition, thereby leading to explosives with excellent overall performance as a result of constrained planarity. This nitroamino&#8208;based switching is also expected to have applications in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#160;self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in molecular switches is critical for adaptive materials. However, most of the reported molecular switches are not capable of modulating hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in energetic materials, limiting high&#8208;demand applications in explosives. In this work, the first high&#8208;energy nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch is reported. It can control the complex hydrogen&#8208;bonding systems of energetic materials by reversible cycling for property modulation.

     alt="A Reversible Nitroamino-Based Switch Modulates Hydrogen-Bonding Networks in Energetic Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising nitroamino-based switch has been introduced into energetic compounds that can effectively coordinate twin crystals induced by hydrogen-bonding competition, thereby leading to explosives with excellent overall performance as a result of constrained planarity. This nitroamino-based switching is also expected to have applications in hydrogen-bonding&#160;self-assembly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation of hydrogen-bonding networks in molecular switches is critical for adaptive materials. However, most of the reported molecular switches are not capable of modulating hydrogen-bonding networks in energetic materials, limiting high-demand applications in explosives. In this work, the first high-energy nitroamino-based molecular switch is reported. It can control the complex hydrogen-bonding systems of energetic materials by reversible cycling for property modulation. Through alkali-acid stimulation, the nitroamino-based switch undergoes dynamic transitions, which reconfigure H-bond networks and separate twin crystals (in x-ray verification). Supported by crystallography and theoretical modeling (e.g., the density of states), this switching mechanism modulates molecular planarity (&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#952;&#160;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;&#160;60&#176;) and optimizes the energy-stability balance, obtaining a compound &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;-&#946; with comprehensive properties comparable to classical explosives (e.g., RDX and HMX). By linking hydrogen-bonding engineering and energetic materials science through the nitroamino-based molecular switch, it facilitates superior energetic compounds that can be applied to defense equipment. In addition, our work establishes the nitroamino-based switch as a generalized tool for molecular engineering, bridging dynamic hydrogen-bonding control and self-assembly materials design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Drug Loading Pillar[5]Arene&#8208;Based Nanodrug Delivery System Enhances Anticancer Efficacy and Reduces Toxicity</title>

Thioether pillar[5]arene and 6&#8208;hexylpyridinium self&#8208;assemble into a supramolecular nanocarrier system with ultra&#8208;high drug loading efficiency 97% for doxorubicin (DOX), reducing toxicity to normal cells and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor activity. In H2O2, thioether pillar[5]arene transforms into a more water&#8208;soluble derivative, minimizing excipient accumulation and offering new insights for designing safer drug delivery systems.








Abstract
Nanodrug delivery is a critical approach in cancer therapy; however, the deposition of excipients often exacerbates the toxic burden of drugs. Herein, a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (WP5&#8835;C6Py@DOX) has been developed to enhance cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects. This system, constructed through host&#8211;guest interactions between a thioether&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene derivative (WP5) and a pyridinium salt derivative (C6Py), exhibited a remarkable 97% drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). It showed remarkable stability in both aqueous solutions and bovine serum, effectively minimizing premature drug leakage and reducing associated toxicity. The thioether modification of WP5 reacted with H2O2 to generate derivatives with improved water solubility, significantly enhancing biocompatibility while minimizing excipient deposition within endosomes. Cellular experiments revealed that the system not only reduced the toxicity of DOX to normal cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) but also significantly enhanced its antitumor activity against cancer cells (HepG2), with an IC50 of 1.2 &#181;m, markedly outperforming free DOX (IC50: 6.3 &#181;m). Furthermore, laser confocal imaging confirmed that the supramolecular drug delivery system effectively enters and accumulates in cancer cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential.

         <title>Chemical Protein Engineering: Backbone Cyclization Rescues Folding of a 183&#8208;Residue Truncated Domain of Malaria Parasite Protein PfAMA1</title>

We report the first chemical synthesis of a 183&#8208;residue functional truncated cyclic PfAMA1 domain I protein using multi&#8208;segment native chemical ligation and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization to introduce conformational constraints, thereby facilitating protein folding and providing novel strategies for miniature protein engineering.

Abstract
The interaction between apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) and rhoptry neck protein 2 (PfRON2) is crucial for Plasmodium falciparum red blood cell invasion, making it a key target for anti&#8208;malarial drug development strategies. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of PfAMA1 domain I (PfAMA1&#8208;DI) in both linear and backbone&#8208;circularized forms, employing a six&#8208;segment convergent synthesis approach exploiting one&#8208;pot chemistries and solubilizing tags. The chemically synthesized linear PfAMA1&#8208;DI construct exhibited incomplete disulfide bond formation during folding, likely due to increased terminal flexibility in the absence of domain II. To address this, we employed backbone cyclization of the large 180&#8208;residue polypeptide chain, with 3&#8208;residue linker sequence, as a unique strategy to conformationally restrict its termini and facilitate correct disulfide bond formation. Introducing a multipurpose affinity and solubility tag to the cyclicPfAMA1&#8208;DI construct further improved the folding yield by mitigating aggregation. The predicted structure using ColabFold&#8208;Alphafold2 indicated that PfRON2 ligand binds within the hydrophobic groove of the cyclicPfAMA1&#8208;DI construct similar to the native interactions. These findings underscore the potential of large protein backbone cyclization to stabilize protein structure, offering a compelling strategy for the chemical synthesis of otherwise unstable protein domains with broad applications in miniature protein engineering.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Induced by Achiral Dyes in Organogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CPL signals inversion in two binary supramolecular gels were observed which was attributed to the different hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced assemblies in two organogels, implying the interaction between chiral gelator and non&#8208;chiral fluorophore could regulate the sign of CPL signals.








Abstract
Supramolecular assembly strategy is widely applied to develop circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, especially for centrally chiral systems. The CPL sign of supramolecular gels based on a centrally chiral compound is generally regulated by employing the opposite chiral enantiomers. However, controlling CPL signals by regulating the interaction model between the achiral fluorophore and chiral gelator, accompanied by the adjustment of the emission wavelength, remains challenging. Herein, we have developed binary supramolecular gels based on achiral cyanostilbene derivatives and a chiral gelator. Two binary supramolecular gels have displayed achiral fluorophore&#8208;induced CPL sign inversion, attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction between the carboxyl group of two fluorophores and the amino group of chiral gelator. This work reveals a rational approach to the design of CPL material with tunable CPL sign and CPL emission wavelength.

         <title>The Careful Combination of Bismuth Compounds and CAAC: Formal Halonium and Nitrenium Transfer via Radical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental bismuth compounds such as BiCl3 and BiBr(NMe2)2 form simple, colorful adducts with cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes. They undergo facile and selective formal X+ and (NMe2)+ transfer from bismuth to the carbene via peerless radical pathways.








Abstract
Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) are key compounds en route to a plethora of unprecedented low&#8208;valent and radical complexes of transition metals and main group elements. For p&#8208;block elements of the sixth period, however, low&#8208;valent and radical complexes of CAACs are extremely rare, and even simple adducts with CAACs are difficult to access. Here we report the full characterization of the first adduct between a CAAC and a bismuth trihalide, [BiCl3(Me2CAAC)] (1), which has previously only been spectroscopically characterized. 1 and its in situ generated bromido analog form intensely colored solutions in solvent molecule (THF) and undergo formal halonium ion (i.e., X+) transfer from the Bi atom to the carbene carbon atom to give the complex cations [CAAC&#9472;X]+ (X = Cl, Br). Starting from bismuth amide complexes, formal nitrenium ion (i.e., [NR2]+) transfer reactions are observed to give [CAAC&#9472;NR2]+. EPR spectroscopic reaction monitoring indicates the viability of radical processes and suggests the involvement of unprecedented &#945;&#8208;aminyl radicals and mononuclear Bi0 species. Our investigations reveal easily accessible radical pathways via peerless molecular complexes, which proceed in the absence of external reducing agents, as a key factor on the way to exploit the full potential of carbene ligands in the chemistry of sixth row p&#8208;block elements.

Starting from bismuth amide complexes, formal nitrenium ion (i.e., [NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) transfer reactions are observed to give [CAAC&#9472;NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. EPR spectroscopic reaction monitoring indicates the viability of radical processes and suggests the involvement of unprecedented &#945;-aminyl radicals and mononuclear Bi&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species. Our investigations reveal easily accessible radical pathways via peerless molecular complexes, which proceed in the absence of external reducing agents, as a key factor on the way to exploit the full potential of carbene ligands in the chemistry of sixth row p-block elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Activated on&#8208;Surface Self&#8208;Metalation of Pd&#8208;Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surfaces enable scalable reactions. Here, Pd(001) drives the self&#8208;metalation of H2Pc${\rm H}_2{\rm Pc}$, where the molecule captures a substrate atom to form PdPc. Spectroscopy reveals the reaction pathway, marking the first demonstration of phthalocyanine self&#8208;metalation on&#160;Pd.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are essential organic molecules with wide&#8208;ranging applications in fields such as catalysis and optoelectronics, owing to their stable aromatic structure and exceptional thermal stability. Equally important is their versatility, which can be achieved by modifying the central metal atom. In this context, metalation&#8212;the process by which a central metal atom is incorporated into the macrocycle&#8212;plays a critical role in tailoring both the electronic and structural properties of Pcs. In this work, we investigate the thermally activated on&#8208;surface synthesis of palladium phthalocyanine (PdPc) by depositing metal&#8208;free phthalocyanine (H2Pc${\rm H}_2{\rm Pc}$) onto a Pd(001) surface in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Using temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), we analyze the evolution of the N 1s$1s$ core level signal, confirming the successful formation of PdPc. The appearance of a secondary peak in the Pd 3d$3d$ core level, attributed to Pd atoms coordinated within the phthalocyanine molecule after metalation, provides further evidence for the PdPc synthesis. Additionally, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) reveals that no desorption or chemical degradation occurs during the process. We believe this study represents a significant step forward in the scalable synthesis of PdPc, which, like other Pd&#8208;containing organic molecules, holds great potential for applications in catalysis and cancer&#160;therapy.

         <title>&#8220;Living Detergents&#8221;: An in Situ Detergent Tailoring Strategy for Efficient Membrane Protein Stabilization and Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living detergents, distinct from traditional detergents, enable in situ modifications and thus refresh the physical properties for accommodating diverse membrane protein studies. This innovation is achieved through integrating functional tags into traditional detergents which allows bioorthogonal reactions with external structural elements to generate a versatile detergent library. Living detergents represent a flexible, robust platform for detergent customization, advancing the study of structure&#8208;function relationships

Abstract
Detergents are essential molecular tools for membrane protein (MP) research, yet traditional detergents with static properties often fail to address the diverse and evolving needs of MP studies. To this end, this study introduces &#8220;living detergents&#8221;, an innovative class of detergents equipped with functional tags that enable bioorthogonal modifications with externally introduced structural elements. This approach allows for not only the parallel generation of new detergents, but also in situ tuning of MP samples within freshly formed detergents. The efficacy of this strategy was demonstrated through the rapid identification of optimal detergents for high&#8208;quality electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. Overall, this flexible and robust platform enables efficient tailoring of detergents, advancing the exploration of detergent structure&#8208;function relationships in MP research and opening pathways for more specialized solutions for diverse experimental demands.

Electrochemical decarboxylative late&#8208;stage functionalization of the C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminus of natural amino acids is presented. Metal and catalyst&#8208;free protocol widely explored the synthesis of hindered ethers, amines, or di&#8208;peptide.








Abstract
A unified electrochemical decarboxylative strategy for the site&#8208;selective construction of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds is disclosed herein. The metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free decarboxylation provides access to the functionalization of C&#8208; and N&#8208;terminus from the simple amino acid feedstock. A wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary acids or alcohols were well tolerated. Late&#8208;stage functionalization using &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose, di&#8208;peptide, steroid derivatives, and bio&#8208;active drug molecules established the robustness and synthesis potential of our approach.

Abstract
A Lewis base&#8208;free trialumane having a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Tip) substituent was synthesized by a reaction of alumanyl anion with TipAlBr2. The structure, bonding, and electronic properties of the Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane were estimated by NMR spectra, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, DFT calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, and electrochemical study to reveal its two consecutive Al&#9472;Al covalent bonds and overlapped vacant orbitals of three Al atoms. Chemical reduction of Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane gave a series of alumanyl anions via the cleavage of the Al&#9472;Al bonds. This study shows the low&#8208;lying characteristic LUMO that consists of vacant orbitals of three Al atoms in the base&#8208;free trialumane.

         <title>Ammoxidation of Unprotected Glycosides: A One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Alcohols to Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 28, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient C5&#8208;selective ammoxidation of minimally protected carbohydrates enables direct access to nitrile sugars, valuable in bioorthogonal chemistry and drug development. Using TEMPO, PIDA, and ammonium acetate in aqueous acetonitrile, this method offers high selectivity without protecting groups. Mechanistic insights reveal iminoiodinane intermediates, explaining the reaction's remarkable precision.








Abstract
Functionalized carbohydrates are important in various fields, but protection&#8208;free selective functionalization often remains challenging. We demonstrate that the primary hydroxy group in minimally protected carbohydrates can be directly converted into a nitrile group with TEMPO, PIDA, and ammonium acetate. Both nitrile hexopyranoses and nitrile pentofuranoses are obtained and subsequent derivatizations of the nitrile group to other versatile functional groups are demonstrated. Combined evidence from literature and in&#8208;situ reaction progress monitoring with Raman spectroscopy led to the proposal that iminoiodinanes derived from PIDA play an important role in the mechanism of ammoxidation.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient C5-selective ammoxidation of minimally protected carbohydrates enables direct access to nitrile sugars, valuable in bioorthogonal chemistry and drug development. Using TEMPO, PIDA, and ammonium acetate in aqueous acetonitrile, this method offers high selectivity without protecting groups. Mechanistic insights reveal iminoiodinane intermediates, explaining the reaction's remarkable precision.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionalized carbohydrates are important in various fields, but protection-free selective functionalization often remains challenging. We demonstrate that the primary hydroxy group in minimally protected carbohydrates can be directly converted into a nitrile group with TEMPO, PIDA, and ammonium acetate. Both nitrile hexopyranoses and nitrile pentofuranoses are obtained and subsequent derivatizations of the nitrile group to other versatile functional groups are demonstrated. Combined evidence from literature and in-situ reaction progress monitoring with Raman spectroscopy led to the proposal that iminoiodinanes derived from PIDA play an important role in the mechanism of ammoxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immunological and Toxicological Assessment of Triterpenoid Saponins Bearing Lewis&#8208;X&#8208; and QS&#8208;21&#8208;Based Trisaccharides</title>

The synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring QS&#8208;21 minimal immunogenic motif is reported. These chimeric saponins, together with previously synthesized Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins and a rhamnose&#8208;modified saponin, were assessed for their toxicological and immunological profiles in wild&#8208;type and/or hDC&#8208;SIGN transgenic mice.

Abstract
The search for safer and more effective vaccine adjuvants has intensified in recent years, with triterpenoid saponins like QS&#8208;21 and its analogues emerging as promising candidates. We report the synthesis of a novel QS&#8208;21 analogue featuring betulinic acid as aglycone, a lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid with low toxicity derived from white birch bark. Two convergent synthetic routes, involving different protecting groups and glycosyl donors (bromide and trichloroacetimidate), were optimized to construct the QS&#8208;21&#8208;based linear trisaccharide motif critical for adjuvant activity. This strategy also enabled efficient preparation of the structurally similar echinocystic acid analogue reported by Gin. The immunological and toxicological profiles of these chimeric saponins, along with Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing and rhamnose&#8208;modified derivatives, were evaluated in C57BL/6 wild&#8208;type and hDC&#8208;SIGN transgenic mice. While the synthetic saponins exhibited low toxicity in vitro and in vivo, replacing echinocystic acid with betulinic acid reduced immunogenicity when tested with ovalbumin as a model antigen compared to alhydrogel and QS&#8208;21. These findings provide a foundation for developing saponin&#8208;based adjuvants and demonstrate the utility of advanced glycosylation strategies for synthesizing complex unnatural triterpenoid saponins.

A convenient strategy by synergistic delivering DNA and DNA photocleavage agents to tumor cells was developed for effective photodynamic immunotherapy under hypoxia.








Abstract
Plasmid DNAs intercalated with Ru(II) complexes were encapsulated in liposomes to create nano&#8208;photosensitizers. Upon light exposure, the ruthenium complex photo&#8208;cleavages DNA. The DNA fragments specifically stimulate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and induce immunogenic death. This study presents a convenient strategy for photodynamic immunotherapy against cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells under hypoxia.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; Liquids as Condensed&#8208;State Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids are non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state functional materials that generate singlet oxygen (1O2) at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. Chromophores can be incorporated into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that produce 1O2 and membrane impregnated systems can be fabricated to generate 1O2 that migrates across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential for water decontamination.








Abstract
Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short&#8208;lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitizer into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi&#8208;component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids), non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state fluidic materials, as photosensitizers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that are suitable for 1O2 production and analyze the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid photosensitizers. The alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of 1O2 production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate 1O2 within an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.

         <title>Affinity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling Reveals IDH2 as a Mitochondrial Target of Cannabinol in Receptor&#8208;Independent Neuroprotection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical probe CBN&#8208;P based on the neuroprotective cannabinoid cannabinol (CBN) was developed and synthesized. CNB&#8208;P was found to have a similar mechanism of action as the parent compound and was used in click&#8208;CLEM microscopy studies and affinity&#8208;based protein profiling to identify the mitochondrial protein isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as one target of CBN.








Abstract
Phytocannabinoids are attracting growing attention because of their potential for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, the &#8220;minor&#8221; cannabinoid, cannabinol (CBN), has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent, acting independently of classical cannabinoid receptors through as&#8208;yet unidentified mitochondrial targets. To uncover the molecular basis of its neuroprotective effects, we designed and synthesized a chemical probe based on CBN, incorporating a minimalist diazirine linker. Functional assays confirmed that the probe retains CBN's mitochondrial activity and exhibits strong mitochondrial enrichment, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and click&#8208;correlative light and electron microscopy (click&#8208;CLEM). By affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP), we identified isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as a key mitochondrial target of CBN. This finding was further substantiated by siRNA knockdown studies, which revealed that the absence of IDH2 partially phenocopies CBN's effects, validating its role as a critical mediator of CBN's neuroprotective activity.

         <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Crystalline Hydrophobic Alkylated Poly(ethyleneimine)s</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of polyethyleneimine (PEI) induces crystalline hydrophobic domains, critical for CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. Structural evolution during acid/base treatment and ion exchange is revealed by PXRD, SAXS, and inelastic neutron scattering. Findings highlight reversible domain disruption and nanostructure formation, enabling recyclable polymer performance in water purification and CO&#8322; capture.








Abstract
Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a widely used polymer in catalysis, gas separation, water treatment, drug delivery, textiles, and paper production. Carbon dioxide can act as a molecular stimulus for amine&#8208;rich polymers such as PEIs, a property that has been exploited in CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. This process entails amine&#8208;mediated CO&#8322; capture and the in situ formation of bicarbonate ions, which subsequently undergo ion exchange with chloride ions present in both model and real seawater. In this study, we prepared a series of alkylated PEIs with different chainlengths (C4&#8208;C18) and degrees of alkylation (10&#8208;40% alkylation) via simple alkylation as previously reported. The obtained hydrophobic PEI, specifically PEI&#8208;C16, was further investigated in terms of its crystalline structure using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, and inelastic neutron scattering. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the subtle structural changes of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine)s were induced by acid&#8208;mediated protonation and ion exchange, while the polymer maintained its integrity across multiple desalination cycles. These findings advocate for the employment of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine) in CO&#8322;&#8208;responsive processes and carbon capture applications.

&lt;p&gt;Alkylation of polyethyleneimine (PEI) induces crystalline hydrophobic domains, critical for CO&#8322;-mediated desalination. Structural evolution during acid/base treatment and ion exchange is revealed by PXRD, SAXS, and inelastic neutron scattering. Findings highlight reversible domain disruption and nanostructure formation, enabling recyclable polymer performance in water purification and CO&#8322; capture.

         <title>Stereodynamism in Chiral Polyaromatic Phosphepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoid scaffolds can be used to afford diastereoisomers of polyaromatics fused with a chiral seven&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring. In particular, a complex interplay between the inversion at the P centre and helicenoid epimerization, as well as a competition with a rearomatization reaction, takes place.








Abstract
In the present experimental&#8208;computational study, we demonstrate that the stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoids&#160;can be used to afford diastereoisomers of chirally perturbed polyaromatics fused with a phosphepine ring (seven&#8208;membered P&#8208;cycle). The phosphahelicenoids have been synthesized through a stereospecific approach from commercially available BINAPs. In particular, using the combination of NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and chiral HPLC experimental techniques with DFT and higher level ab initio calculations, we highlight a complex interplay between the inversion at the phosphorus stereocenter and the epimerization of the helicenoid framework, as well as a competition with a rearomatization reaction through P&#8208;extrusion. The impact of the conformational modifications on the structure have been studied through X&#8208;ray diffraction. The spectroscopic properties, in particular, of chiroptical nature, including circularly polarized luminescence, are also discussed in detail and compared to DFT and ADC(2) models.

         <title>Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Functionalization of Phenols via &#960;&#8208;Coordination Activation: Mechanochemical Access to N&#8208;Aryl Amides and &#945;&#8208;Aryl Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mkrtchyan and Iaroshenko et al. report a convenient approach for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides and &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids/esters/ketones via Ru&#8208;catalyzed expected and unexpected dehydrative cross&#8208;coupling of unprotected phenols with primary amides or alkyl carboxylic acids/esters/ketones. The present protocol involves Ru&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative functionalization of phenols via &#960;&#8208;coordination activation.








Abstract
Given the vast occurrence and availability of both primary amides and phenols, the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via direct coupling between these starting materials would be much attractive. Herein, we report an efficient method for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed direct amidation of unprotected phenols with primary amides with water as the sole byproduct. Unexpectedly, replacing amides with methyl carboxylic acids, esters, or ketones, the same reaction led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives instead of the anticipated aryl carboxylates. The synthetic strategy accepts a wide scope of primary amides, alkyl carbonyls, and phenolic substrates to deliver 28 expected N&#8208;aryl amides and 14 unexpected &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives with good to excellent yields. The developed synthetic approach would serve as the better alternative to the classical cross&#8208;coupling reactions in context to the PASE (pot, atom, and step economy) synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Efficient and Rapid Arylation of NH&#8322;&#8208;Unprotected Bromobisindole Ethanamines via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling: Generating New Leads Against Leishmania</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of novel bisindole derivatives was synthesized through an optimized rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindole ethanamines and boronic acids with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against L. infantum promastigotes. In particular, bisindole 3af demonstrated potent antileishmanial activity with a higher selectivity index compared to the reference drug miltefosine.








Abstract
Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which presents significant global health challenges due to the lack of effective vaccines and the limitations of existing chemotherapeutics in view of their toxicity, resistance, and high costs. In this study, we realized a library of novel bisindole derivatives as potential antileishmanial agents through a rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindole ethanamines and boronic acids. Optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the efficient and selective arylation of these substrates, with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against Leishmania infantum promastigotes. Among the tested bisindole derivatives, 3af (bearing a 4&#8208;vinylphenyl moiety) demonstrated potent antileishmanial activity (IC50 = 1.1 &#181;M) with a higher selectivity index (21.8) compared to the reference drug miltefosine (9.8). A significant activity was also retained against intracellular amastigotes. This study establishes a robust methodology for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bisindoles, also highlighting these derivatives' potential as promising leads for antileishmanial drug development.

         <title>Salt or Cocrystal Puzzle Solved by Mechanochemistry: The Role of Solvent in the Pamoic Acid Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pamoic acid:quinoline cocrystal and pamoate:quinolinium salts can be synthetized by mechanochemistry tuning the reaction conditions. Computational analysis of the crystal packing reveals the main factors driving the formation of either forms. This approach and subsequent rationalization pave the way to the synthesis of pharmaceutically active multicomponent systems with tunable properties.








Abstract
Many drugs are nowadays marketed as salts. Cocrystallization is also emerging as a convenient tool to modify in vivo activity of pharmacologically active compounds. Given the marked difference in physicochemical properties between salts and cocrystals, the possibility of obtaining crystalline systems composed of the same building blocks in their neutral or charged form is desirable. Pamoic acid (PAM) is widely used in pharmaceutical formulation as pamoate salt, and we here propose a unique synthetic strategy to obtain a cocrystal of PAM rather than a salt by tuning mechanochemical conditions. Our findings have been corroborated by means of computational analyses, relating to the noncovalent interactions in the crystal structure with the formation of the different crystalline forms. A detailed analysis of the structure containing PAM in its neutral, anionic or dianionic form present in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) helped generalizing our results.

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Motion of Tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone within Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystals Through Variation of the Donor: An Entropic and Enthalpic Point of View.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a detailed investigation on the factors affecting the in&#8208;plane motion of tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFBQ) within a series of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals formed with various fused aromatic donors. Six crystalline materials were obtained, including four cocrystals, a polymorph, and a solid solution. These were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state NMR, FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. All cocrystals exhibited short p&#8208;stacking interactions and varied non&#8208;covalent interactions modulating the in&#8208;plane motion of TFBQ. 19F T&#8321; relaxation measurements allowed the quantification of the activation enthalpies (&#916;H&#8225;) and entropies (&#916;S&#8225;), with theoretical calculations backing these results. Cocrystal 4 is the solid with the most restricted motions due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, cocrystal 3a depicts the highest in&#8208;plane motional frequencies (up to 2.2 MHz at 300 K), owing to the weak contacts around TFBQ. Surprisingly, a solid solution (5), which resembled a mixture of cocrystals 2 and 3a, displayed no significant in&#8208;plane motions, despite having similar packing and relaxation behavior to the binary cocrystals. This work illustrates how subtle variations in donor structure affect the in&#8208;plane motions and photophysical properties of CT cocrystals, providing valuable insight into the rational design of functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polypyrrole as a photothermal reactor to conduct solvent&#8208;free pericyclic reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent&#8208;free organic reactions have proved to be sustainable and efficient strategy in organic synthesis. Current solvent&#8208;free approaches include mechanochemical, microwave&#8208;assisted, and ultrasound&#8208;irradiated methods. As a complementary strategy, photothermal materials may also be used in solvent&#8208;free chemistry, offering the advantage of utilizing eco&#8208;friendly solar energy. Polypyrroles, the black conjugated polymers, feature facile synthesis, high stability and excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability, enabling it to server as photothermal reactors to conduct solvent&#8208;free thermal&#8208;induced reactions. Here, a series of polypyrrole materials have been synthesized in the presence of various surfactants. The usage of dodecyl dimethyl betaine afforded PPy&#8208;BS, which achieved a highest photothermal performance (241&#176;C under 100 W halogen&#8208;lamp irradiation). On this basis, PPy&#8208;BS was employed as a photothermal reactor for Diels&#8208;Alder, dipolar cycloaddition, and electrocyclization reactions under solvent&#8208;free conditions. All trials work well, affording good to excellent yields up to 90%. Notably, PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactor exhibits excellent recyclability (over eight cycles without loss of the yields of the conducted model reactions), high loading amount of substrates, and upscaling to 1000 mg per batch. In brief, this study highlights the advantages of PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactors for pericyclic reactions, offering a recyclable, up&#8208;scalable, and solvent&#8208;free platform for sustainable organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Helical Metallocryptand for Size&#8208;Selective Recognition of Amino Acid Derivatives with Aliphatic Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was designed and synthesized. Its crystallographic analysis revealed the presence as a helical enantiomeric pair, right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) forms, rather than the meso&#8208;form, which was energetically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This LNi3 host was capable of recognizing amino acid derivatives by several non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. Its shape&#8208;persistent nature of the cryptand facilitated the size&#8208;based discrimination, which was clearly demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration studies. Recognition of some of the guests caused the emergence of CD signals, indicating the biased P/M helix inversion equilibrium of LNi3. Three aliphatic side&#8208;chain guests, Val, Ile, and Leu, caused an M&#8208;favored shifting, while two &#960;&#8208;containing side&#8208;chain guests, Arg and Trp, showed the preference to the P&#8208;form. This metallocryptand, LNi3, overcomes the limitation in recognition of less polar amino acids having an alkyl side chain and provided future applications in molecular recognition, biochemical sensing, and enantiomeric sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Inorganic&#8208;Organic Rotaxanes and Related Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extension of previous studies of heterometallic rings (HMRs) is described, including new synthetic chemistry and physics. These HMRs feature a ring of, typically, eight&#8208;metal centres with a central charge balancing cation. New HMRs and related molecules are described, varying the number of metals present. The eight&#8208;metal HMRs have been used as components of larger supramolecular assembly, most often by making the HMRs into [2]rotaxanes or pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes, where the thread of the rotaxane is terminated by a binding group such as pyridine. This allows the formation of [n]rotaxanes, where n = 3, 4, 5,7, 13 or 1014. Mass spectrometry and NMR studies of the HMRs have given greater understanding of the host&#8208;guest chemistry of these metal analogues of crown ethers. Physical studies have included 4D&#8208;inelastic neutron scattering and continuous wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure magnetic interactions between spin components of the supramolecular assemblies. The use of the HMRs as resists for high resolution lithography is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Double Perovskites Doped with Sb3+/Er3+ as Stable and Effective Luminescence Materials in the Vis&#8208;NIR Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The luminescence properties of stable halide double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI &#8211; 40% Ag, 60% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ in the region 250&#8208;1600 nm were investigated for the first time and reveal significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman Spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3+ ions emit blue light at 450 nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3+ ions. Notably, the Er3+ emit radiation at 1540 nm, a wavelength particularly advantageous for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525 nm, 552 nm, 665 nm and 805 nm are observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3+ ions. These compelling results have been supported by calculations based on Modified Crystal Field Theory, elucidating the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3+ and Er3+ on the crystal structure and luminescent properties. Leveraging the synthesized materials, we successfully have developed a LED prototype that utilizes a UV chip &#160;combined with the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.9Er0.01Sb0.09Cl6 powder as a stable and effective luminophore for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Reducibility&#8208;tunable Carbon Dots for Efficient Radicals Scavenging and Material&#8208;controlled Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient, nontoxic and low&#8208;cost nano&#8208;antioxidants has attracted extensive attentions in food preservation, but still remains greet challenges in materials design and mechanism exploration. Herein, a novel reductive carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) was successfully synthesized via a simple pyrolysis technique using sucrose as the precursor. The experimental results show that&#160;r&#8208;CDs possess excellent reducibility, and can effectively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). So, the r&#8208;CDs exhibits remarkable preservation effect on apple and strawberry, and significantly extends their shelf&#8208;life. Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon&#8208;core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process.&#160;More interestingly, the reducibility of r&#8208;CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N&#8208;doped CDs (N&#8208;CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material&#8208;controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development&#160;of non&#8208;toxic, efficient carbon nano&#8208;antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material&#8208;controlled synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies and Phosphorus&#8208;Doped P&#8208;WO 3&#8208;x /CC&#160;Electrocatalysts Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>Constructing non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts with good hydrogen evolution activity is crucial for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. The synergistic optimization of the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption steps presents a challenge for the HER.&#160;Here,&#160;we &#160;have synthesized&#160;phosphorus&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide with oxygen vacancies (P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x) using a simple but&#160;effective hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination annealing.&#160;Interestingly, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x material exhibits unique characteristics that set it apart from conventional tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The introduction of oxygen vacancies and phosphorus doping creates an optimal structure that significantly improves the electronic properties and the catalytic sites. The oxygen vacancies enhance the material&#8217;s ability to adsorb and activate water molecules, while phosphorus doping further modifies the electronic structure, facilitating more efficient hydrogen desorption. Meanwhile, the catalyst demonstrates a favorable urchin&#8208;like morphology&#160;with excellent supportability. Remarkably, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x&#160;electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent HER performance and excellent durability.&#160;We indicate that P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x exhibits&#160;a small overpotential (155.42 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2), a low Tafel slope (74.97 mV dec&#8208;1), and excellent durability over 12 hours. This work presents a significant advance for the development of tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#160;with&#160;anion doping and oxygen vacancies&#160;for HER in acidic media.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Exploration of Stereoelectronic Relationships in Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed computational investigation of stereoelectronic effects in enantioselective manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions uncovered two general routes to improved selectivity; namely extension of &#960;&#8208;system and increased steric bulk (quantified through occupied volume in quadrants). Electronic effects were evaluated through Hammett correlations, revealing opposing electronic demands on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the key catalytic step of H2 activation.








Abstract
Stereoelectronic effects governing Mn&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions have been deconvoluted through the analysis of a series of in silico catalyst modifications using DFT (PBE0&#8208;D3PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;TZVP//RI&#8208;BP86PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;SVP level of theory). Computations were performed on the Mn&#8208;catalyzed reduction of indanone based on a catalyst from the Clarke group, consisting of a tridentate ligand with pyridine, amine, and phosphine donors and a ferrocenyl linker in the backbone. Enantioselectivity enhancements were found through two pathways; first, with the stabilization of aromatic substrates by means of an extended &#960;&#8208;system, enhancing &#960;&#8208;stacking noncovalent interactions; second, by the introduction of steric bulk around the active site to destabilize one of the diastereomeric hydride transfer transition states. Electronic effects were differentiated from sterics by modification of the phenyl groups at the phosphine, trans&#8208; to the metal&#8208;hydride bond. While electron&#8208;withdrawing groups increased the thermodynamic driving force, the highest activity is predicted with electron&#8208;donating groups due to the improved basicity of the nitrogen lone pair, required for the initiation of hydrogen activation. Based on these observations, promising routes for synthetic catalyst design may involve donating groups which improve activity, coupled with enantiodiscrimination via steric bulk as a more general strategy than being limited to &#960;&#8208;containing substrates.

         <title>Role of Symmetry to Dictate Pathway&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;assembly in Photoresponsive Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the role of molecular symmetry with respect to azobenzene and the effect of local microenvironment in governing the self&#8208;assembly and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of peptide amphiphiles, revealing distinct aggregation pathways.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides offer interesting structural space in the realm of emergent pathway&#8208;driven supramolecular polymerization toward designing functional nanomaterials with precise structure&#8208;function characteristics. However, the role of molecular symmetry in such peptides to govern the self&#8208;assembly pathway dynamics remains less explored. We design amyloid&#8208;inspired, azobenzene&#8208;functionalized symmetric (P1) and asymmetric (P2) peptide amphiphiles in the E form of the azobenzene motif to systematically investigate the interplay of molecular symmetry, solvent composition, and temperature to guide supramolecular organization. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses reveal distinct aggregation pathways, with E&#8208;P1 exhibiting rapid nucleation&#8208;elongation toward robust and stable nanofibers, while E&#8208;P2 assembles into a kinetic state (E&#8208;P2(KS)) that subsequently transforms into thermodynamically favored nanoribbons, E&#8208;P2(TS), via a &#8220;good and bad solvent&#8221; modulation strategy. Further, E&#8208;P1 remains structurally resilient due to stronger intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, E&#8208;P2 demonstrates reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization in both kinetic and thermodynamic states, facilitating supramolecular disassembly while retaining the self&#8208;organization memory. Notably, the activation energy barriers for Z&#8594;E isomerization in P2 differ between its kinetic and thermodynamic states, underscoring the role of pathway complexity and molecular symmetry in peptide assembly. These insights advance the understanding of symmetry&#8208;regulated supramolecular assembly to modulate the emergent functional properties for potential applications in nanotechnology and biomaterials.

         <title>Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy Combined with Autophagy Inhibition to Enhance Synergistic Immunotherapy for Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs can accurately target tumor cells, and the ER&#8208;targeting photosensitizer CET can be used as an ICD inducer for amplifying the ICD effect. Meanwhile, the ER PDT was further strengthened by autophagy inhibition, which can achieve more effective autophagy&#8208;regulated photodynamic synergistic immunotherapy for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.








Abstract
Activating immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy. However, photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;mediated ICD effect is severely limited due to the extremely short half&#8208;life and limited diffusion radius of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hindering effective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction. In addition, targeted therapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains hugely challenging due to the lack of expression of multiple receptors. Herein, we constructed a hierarchical targeting and controllable intelligent nanodelivery material Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ based on poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with remarkable solubility and stability, loaded with a novel photosensitized ICD inducer, CET, and autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Excitingly, Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs can accurately recognize TNBC tumor cells under the mediation of SRC protein. Moreover, CET could achieve observable enrichment in the ER and amplify the ICD effect by in situ ER PDT, which is further strengthened by the autophagy inhibition caused by CQ. All results show that Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs exhibited excellent targeting ability to tumor cells and ER and effectively enhanced synergistic immunotherapy of in situ ER PDT combined with autophagy inhibition, which significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Overall, our study provides a novel strategy and meaningful guideline for targeted&#8208;PDT&#8208;synergistic immunotherapy of TNBC.

         <title>Chiral Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Catalysts Prepared Using a Silica Helical Nanoplatform for the Enantioselective Photooxidation of Aromatic Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral COSAN Nanocatalysts: Enantiopure silica COSAN&#8208;Hybrid nanohelices have been prepared by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of achiral COSAN anions and silica hybrid nanohelices. Their optical activity was confirmed by CD and ROA measurements. These COSAN&#8208;Hybrids are efficient and recoverable catalysts in the photooxidative kinetic resolution of aromatic secondary alcohols, achieving up to 85% ee.








Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8722;) named COSAN is a sandwich&#8208;type metallacarborane that has been widely explored in a variety of fields, due to its interesting physical and chemical properties. While COSAN and its derivatives have recently been investigated in catalysis, their chiral counterparts have, to our knowledge, never been investigated in asymmetric catalysis. This may be due to the difficulty associated with preparing and isolating enantiopure COSAN derivatives. Inspired by our previous work on the chiral induction of nanoscale silica helices on achiral objects, we prepared and characterized enantiopure COSAN&#8208;based left&#8208;and right&#8208;handed hybrid silica nanohelices (NANOCOSANs). In these structures, achiral COSAN anions are encapsulated within left&#8208;and right&#8208;handed organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid nanohelices, which serve as a chiral platform for COSAN in enantioselective transformations. The morphology and structural composition of these NANOCOSAN hybrids as well as the presence of COSAN species were confirmed using UV/Vis, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and solid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Their optical activity was demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and Raman optical activity (ROA), highlighting the induction of chirality from chiral hybrid nanohelices to the achiral COSAN anions. To the best of our knowledge, these NANOCOSAN hybrids represent the first examples of COSAN&#8208;based chiral systems displaying chiroptical effects. In addition, they show excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the photooxidation of secondary aromatic alcohols in water. Specifically, the left&#8208;handed NANOCOSAN that selectively oxidizes the (S)&#8208;alcohol, while the right&#8208;handed oxidizes the (R)&#8208;alcohol, achieving up to 85% enantiomeric excess (ee). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle catalytic experiment demonstrates the transfer of chiroptical properties from the hybrid nanohelices to the catalytically active and originally achiral COSAN anion, enabling supramolecular asymmetric catalysis. Remarkably, the catalyst was recovered and reused at least three times without any loss of catalytic activity or enantioselectivity. This study reports the first example of enantiopure COSAN&#8208;containing nanohelices, which can promote photooxidation of organic substrates in water with high enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chiral COSAN Nanocatalysts&lt;/b&gt;: Enantiopure silica COSAN-Hybrid nanohelices have been prepared by electrostatic co-assembly of achiral COSAN anions and silica hybrid nanohelices. Their optical activity was confirmed by CD and ROA measurements. These COSAN-Hybrids are efficient and recoverable catalysts in the photooxidative kinetic resolution of aromatic secondary alcohols, achieving up to 85% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;.

A readily available isatin molecule serves as amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter to enable chromatography&#8208;free high&#8208;throughput optimization of an organocatalytic asymmetric Michael addition solely based on the analysis of UV and circular dichroism inductions that are obtained directly from the reaction mixtures and without time&#8208;consuming sample preparation or work&#8208;up.








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction development of an organocatalytic Michael addition is achieved by using a readily available isatin molecule as an amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as a chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter. The use of UV and circular dichroism inductions allows on&#8208;the&#8208;fly, chromatography&#8208;free parallel screening of a hundred reaction conditions to identify a catalytic procedure that converts a primary amine to either enantiomer of an a&#8208;branched chiral product in excellent yields and ee&#8217;s. The isatin is recyclable and can be quantitatively recovered if desired. This case study shows how chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening with a multitasking reagent can increase method development speed and reduce cost and waste compared to traditional reaction optimization workflows by streamlining the analysis of small&#8208;scale reaction setups and eliminating time&#8208;consuming work&#8208;up protocols.

The catalytic asymmetric Michael additions of 1&#8208;pyrroline esters to &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alkenyl imides and azodicarboxylates in the presence of AgOAc or CuOAc catalyst have been established.








Abstract
The asymmetric Michael addition reactions of 1&#8208;pyrroline esters with &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alkenyl imides and dialkyl azodicarboxylates catalyzed by the AgOAc/Ph&#8208;phosferrox or CuOAc/(R)&#8208;BINAP complex have been developed. A series of chiral 1,5,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrroline ester derivatives have been obtained in 53%&#8211;90% yields with 80%&#8211;99% ee&#8217;s and all&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic application of the chiral trifluoromethylated 1&#8208;pyrroline adducts were exhibited: the pyrrolizidin&#8208;3&#8208;one analogue was first synthesized with 94% ee and&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr through two steps of hydrolysis and reductive cyclization; the pyrrolidine and lactam derivatives were also successfully provided under the reducing conditions of NaBH3CN and Pd/C&#9472;H2, respectively.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Production Type Prussian Blue Analogues: A Family of Promising Hosts for High&#8208;Performance Multivalent&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Wu and coworkers review the recent progress of entropy&#8208;enhanced Prussian blue analogues as one typical class of high&#8208;performance electrode for non&#8208;monovalent metal&#8208;ion batteries. The influence of introducing the entropy increase strategy in terms of structure and electrochemistry is introduced emphatically.








Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;performance, safe, and cost&#8208;effective multivalent&#8208;ion batteries is pivotal for sustainable energy storage. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), with their open framework and tunable redox&#8208;active sites, hold significant promise but face challenges in structural instability and sluggish ion diffusion. This review focuses on entropy production PBAs (EP&#8208;PBAs) for non&#8208;monovalent ion (Zn2+, Al3+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) battery systems. Incorporating multiple transition metals into PBAs leverages entropy production effects to stabilize crystal structures, enhance ion diffusion kinetics, and improve cycling stability. Synthesis methods such as coprecipitation, electrochemical deposition, and hydrothermal techniques are compared, with coprecipitation emerging as the most scalable approach. Entropy engineering mitigates lattice distortion, reduces defects, and suppresses phase transitions, enabling EP&#8208;PBAs to achieve high specific capacities and long&#8208;term stability. Challenges including interfacial instability and synthesis complexity are discussed, alongside future directions in material optimization, electrolyte compatibility, and scalable production. This work highlights the potential of entropy&#8208;stabilized PBAs as next&#8208;generation cathodes for multivalent&#8208;ion batteries, advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis and Isolation of Unimolecular Oligo[n]catenanes Using a One&#8208;Pot CuAAC &#8220;Click&#8221; Reaction Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic approach using copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) ring&#8208;closing strategies in relatively dilute conditions was used to make &#8220;click&#8221; [n]catenanes with open metal&#8208;binding sites at the ends for further growth. First, a [2]catenane was made at 82% yield using a slow&#8208;addition method. Then, a rapid&#8208;addition one&#8208;pot method was used to make a well&#8208;defined dispersity of [2]&#8211;[6]catenanes with an overall yield of 18%.








Abstract
Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain&#8208;like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that are distinct in comparison to traditional molecular architectures, a fact that makes catenanes potentially attractive building blocks in the construction of next&#8208;generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [n]catenanes are either low yielding or are laborious, often relying on multistep pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [n]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template&#8208;directed one&#8208;pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline&#8208;based building blocks and CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [n]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)&#8208;based templation and click chemistry, ultimately resulting in a one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to make either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well&#8208;defined linear [2]&#8211;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the alkyne&#8208; and azide&#8208;functionalized precursors (i.e., slowly or all at once). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway toward the preparation of higher&#8208;order [n]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain-like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that are distinct in comparison to traditional molecular architectures, a fact that makes catenanes potentially attractive building blocks in the construction of next-generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes are either low yielding or are laborious, often relying on multistep pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template-directed one-pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline-based building blocks and CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)-based templation and click chemistry, ultimately resulting in a one-pot synthetic strategy to make either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well-defined linear [2]&#8211;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the alkyne- and azide-functionalized precursors (i.e., slowly or all at once). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway toward the preparation of higher-order [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality Effects in Peptide&#8208;Based Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterochiral peptides are known to exhibit unique folding and self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Yet, the impact of heterochirality in peptide&#8208;based dynamic combinatorial chemistry remains largely unexplored. This study reveals that chirality effects can be used to increase diversity in dynamic combinatorial libraries, significantly enhancing the potential applications of these systems in the discovery of new drugs, biosensors, and adaptive materials.








Abstract
Naturally occurring peptides are almost exclusively composed of L&#8208;amino acids, and the incorporation of D&#8208;amino acids can profoundly alter their ability to fold and self&#8208;assemble. Here we explore the effects of chirality on the formation of disulfide dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) generated by short cysteine&#8208;rich peptides. Our findings consistently show that heterochiral tripeptides form more diverse DCLs than their homochiral counterparts. The most complex library appears to encompass all possible cyclic species up to 19mers. Given that each of these species exists as a mixture of parallel and antiparallel isomers, we estimate this library to contain a total of 2,045 distinct compounds&#8212;a remarkable result considering that the library generated by the analogous homochiral peptide predominantly contains two dimers. In certain situations, peptide chirality also affects the relative stability of parallel and antiparallel isomers. Taken together, these results show that small changes in peptide chirality can be dramatically amplified through the formation of cyclic species.

         <title>A ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase inhibitor that has antituberculosis and herbicidal activity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione,&#160;1f&#160;is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;(Mt) KARI (Ki&#160;= 23.3 nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the&#160;MtKARI homolog from&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;(Sa),&#160;SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for&#160;Oryza sativa&#160;KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by&#160;1f&#160;is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146 nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties,&#160;1f&#160;has an MIC of 12.7 &#181;M for&#160;MtH37Rv and inhibits&#160;Brassica campestris&#160;growth by 63% at 10 mg/mL. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven electron transfer and subsequent multielectron storage is among the key aspects of photochemical reactions in artificial photosynthesis and molecular electronics. Following our previously introduced design and characterization of Ru(II)&#8208;based photosensitizers, four new Ru complexes with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands featuring a flavin&#8208;inspired subunit were investigated via density functional theory in order to evaluate their electrochemical properties ahead of a time and resource demanding synthesis. Two complexes, Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB and Ru&#8208;Me2deazaalloxB, with a bent ligand architecture, were identified as promising candidates for application in light&#8208;driven charge accumulation and synthesized subsequently. The electrochemical characterization of Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB confirmed the theoretical predictions and its photophysical properties were investigated using UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman, time&#8208;resolved emission and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical simulations. Furthermore, first insights into the electronic distribution in the singly&#8208;reduced complex were modeled computationally and obtained by EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry.

         <title>Porous Nitrogen&#8208;doped Nb2C Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic ORR to Selectively Produce H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for H2O2 production. Among various types of potential catalysts, MXene have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding electrical conductivity, abundant edge active sites, and low costs. In this study, we successfully synthesize porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method and investigate their ORR performance toward the formation of H2O2. The doping of nitrogen effectively modulates the electronic structure of Nb2C nanosheets, while the abundant surface pores formed during ammonia etching facilitate the ORR process. Hence, the electrocatalytic performance of N&#8208;Nb2C nanosheets is significantly improved, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability. Notably, in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) tests, the N&#8208;Nb2C catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 86.8%, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production through electrocatalytic ORR. Our findings suggest that N&#8208;doped Nb2C holds great promise for applications in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Isocoumarins via Light&#8208;Driven Carboxylative Cyclization Reaction of o&#8208;Ethynyl Aryl Bromides with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides with CO2 selectivity produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity for the isocoumarins over the corresponding phthalides.








Abstract
Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods for isocoumarins have been developed. However, the synthesis of isocoumarins via the catalytic CO2 fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO2 into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides with CO2, which selectively produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The light-driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-ethynyl aryl bromides with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity for the isocoumarins over the corresponding phthalides.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods for isocoumarins have been developed. However, the synthesis of isocoumarins via the catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the light-driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-ethynyl aryl bromides with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which selectively produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks for the capture of iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient materials for trapping radioactive iodine is essential for the safe use of nuclear energy. Herein, we present a strategy to synergistically enhance iodine capture by exploiting the flexible building blocks with the affinity properties of electrically rich heteroatoms by combining the cyclic triphosphonitrile derivative, with amine linkers of different molecular lengths, and constructing triangular pore&#8208;structured flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks. A series of cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based COFs (CTP&#8208;X&#8208;COF, X=PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT) with triangular pore topology were synthesized usingCTP&#8208;6 as the node and connection point of p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA), 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 5,5&#8208;diamino2,2&#8208;bipyridine (BPY), and 4,4&#8208;diaminotribiphenyl (DPT) with different molecular lengths. It was found that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine vapor were 4.65 g g&#8208;1, 4.18 g g&#8208;1, 2.38 g g&#8208;1 and 3.57 g g&#8208;1, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine in cyclohexane were 281.50 mg g&#8208;1, 221.67 mg g&#8208;1, 161.14 mg g&#8208;1, and 222.67 mg g&#8208;1, respectively. It was found that the four COFs adsorbed iodine in cyclohexane solution was a mixed adsorption process with chemical adsorption playing a predominant role and physical adsorption as an auxiliary mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Cyclopeptide&#8208;Based Chemical Models for Allosteric Disulfide and Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here designer water soluble triazolophanes as a platform for mimicking the allosteric disulfide conformation. The allosteric &#8208;LHHook disulfide conformation has been stabilized by a protein like intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The striking similarity of the fibrils of the designer macrocycle with amyloids and its autofluorescence is a noteworthy finding.








Abstract
We present here a series of isomeric disulfide&#8208;based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self&#8208;assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 23&#8208;membered macrocycle showed the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X&#8208;ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with &#8208;LHHook geometry.

         <title>ENHANCED POLYSULFIDE REGULATION IN RECHARGEABLE LI&#8208;S BATTERIES WITH ZnS AS ELECTROCATALYST: EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION AND INTERFACIAL INSIGHTS FROM SIMULATIONS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (~80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as a Li&#8208;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8208;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted TzTz derivatives including imidazolyl, o&#8208;vanillyl, p&#8208;vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K&#8208;edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &#960;&#215;&#215;&#215;&#960; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4 eV in solution and up to 1 eV in solid state, and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperbranched polysiloxanes are a class of nonconventional polymers with unique structural features and excellent physicochemical properties, which have attracted great attention in the field of luminescent materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in the study of luminescence mechanisms and optical properties of various hyperbranched polymers containing Si&#8208;O&#8208;C segments with Si as branching points, including hyperbranched polysiloxanes, hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes, and hyperbranched polysilphosphates. Through molecular design and structural regulation, researchers have successfully achieved multi&#8208;color fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission ranging from blue to red in these polymers, with quantum yields reaching up to 54.1% and fluorescence lifetimes up to 9.73 &#956;s. The AIE properties and excellent biocompatibility of these polymers provide new materials and strategies for applications in bioimaging, controlled drug release, information security encryption, and ion detection. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges for further development are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the polar conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light&#8208;blue over 720 h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the polar environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Intermolecular O&#8208;Peptidylation Protocol Enabled by Sequential Acyl Transfer on Thiol&#8208;Incorporated Threonine Followed by Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage intermolecular O&#8208;acylation of the threonine (Thr) side chain was accomplished by reacting thiol&#8208;incorporated Thr with a peptide thioester in open air. The thioester, which contained the volatile trifluoroethanethiol, facilitated the formation of S,O&#8208;diacyl peptides. These were subsequently converted into the desired O&#8208;acyl threonine isopeptide through silver&#8208;mediated thioester selective activation followed by desulfurization.








Abstract
The thiol functionality on the methyl group of a threonine derivative [Thr(SH)] facilitates O&#8208;acylation of the Thr hydroxy group with a thioester. We previously showed that a Thr(SH)&#8208;incorporated peptide thioester can be converted to the corresponding Thr&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptide through intramolecular thioester exchange (S&#9472;S acyl transfer) and subsequent desulfurization of the O&#8208;acyl peptide resulting from intramolecular S&#9472;O acyl transfer. Based on our success in depsipeptide synthesis, we applied the Thr(SH)&#8208;facilitated protocol to the synthesis of branched O&#8208;acyl isopeptides. Initial attempts identified two issues. First, the S&#8208;acylation step with a thioester proceeds in an entropically preferential manner in cyclic depsipeptide synthesis, but not in the case of branched isopeptides. Using a highly volatile thiol component in the thioester solved this issue. Second, the intermolecular thioester change step was accompanied by the formation of an S,O&#8208;diacyl intermediate as a major component; this issue was solved by using thioester&#8208;selective activation of the diacyl species with silver(I) salt followed by desulfurization. Ultimately, the optimized Thr(SH)&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;acylation of a Thr residue in peptide sequences. We show that the protocol has wide substrate scope and demonstrate its application to ubiquitination of the Thr residue of HOIL&#8208;1 peptide.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis of the Polycyclic Norcembranoid and Cembranoid Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, we summarize&#160;the recent advances in the total synthesis of specific cembranoid and norcembranoid diterpenoids, including pavidolide B, scabrolide A, nominal scabrolide B, havellockate, ineleganolide, sinulochmodin C, rameswaralide, scabrolide B, sinuscalide C, horiolide, and fragilolide A. Notably, we showcase the bio&#8208;inspired transformations and highlight the latest breakthroughs in the total synthesis of these natural products.








Abstract
The C19 norcembranoid and C20 cembranoid diterpenoids represent an intriguing class of natural products found in both marine and terrestrial environments. These complexes, with a highly oxygenated state and compact polycyclic structures, have captured the synthetic interests due to their unique bioactivities. Over the past two decades, the total synthesis of these natural products has been a challenging task, driven by their intricate structural features. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in the total synthesis of various norcembranoid and cembranoid diterpenoids, focusing on their transformations and the latest breakthroughs in this field.

We present high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR spectroscopy studies on a series of pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidally coordinated ErIII(DAPMBH/H2DAPS)X complexes with different apical ligands (X&#160;=&#160;(H2O)Cl (1), (CH3OH)N3 (2), Cl2 (3)) to directly determine the electronic properties of the ground state and low&#8208;energy Kramers doublets, namely effective g&#8208;tensors and zero field splittings. Our findings are compared to the results of numerical studies and are used to rationalise the observed differences in magnetic relaxation behavior.








Abstract
High&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field electron paramagnetic resonance studies on a series of seven&#8208;coordinate pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal (PBP) erbium(III) complexes Er(DAPMBH/H2DAPS)X (H2DAPMBH&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diacetylpyridine bis&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy benzoylhydrazone, H4DAPS&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diacetylpyridine bis&#8208;(salicylhydrazone)) demonstrate the effects of different apical ligands (X&#160;=&#160;(H2O)Cl (1), (CH3OH)N3 (2), Cl2 (3)) on the local magnetic anisotropy of the central ErIII ions. In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective g&#8208;values and zero field splittings of the energetically low&#8208;lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial g&#8208;tensor for SMM behavior and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low&#8208;lying excited states.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dicyanation of Alkenes Enabled by Phosphorus Radical Cation Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic strategy for the direct dicyanation of styrenes with TMSCN. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation, enabling the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes. Further synthetic transformations of these dinitrile motifs and mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway have been demonstrated.








Abstract
While notable progress has been made in alkene cyanation for the synthesis of alkyl nitriles, catalytic strategies enabling the direct dicyanation of simple alkenes remain relatively under&#8208;explored. In this study, we introduce a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic system that facilitates the direct dicyanation of styrenes using TMSCN in the presence of oxidant. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation. This protocol allows for the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes under mild conditions. Notably, the method exhibits broad substrate scope and commendable efficiency, serving as a valuable complement to existing cyanation methodologies. The synthetic utility of the dinitrile products is further demonstrated through diverse derivatization reactions, highlighting their applicability in constructing nitrogen&#8208;rich molecular architectures. Mechanistic studies provide further insight into the reaction pathway and underscore the potential of phosphorus radical cations in alkene functionalization.

         <title>A Convergent Approach to Resorcinolic Macrolides to Expand Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and enantioselective approach to resorcinolic macrolides enables targeted C15 modifications, macrocycle rigidity, and a novel cyclic peptide hybrid strategy to tune ATP&#8208;binding site selectivity. Structural alterations enhance Hsp90 paralog inhibition, introduce covalent warheads for GRP94, and reveal new inhibitors of KRasG12C, expanding ATP&#8208;mimetic chemical space for drug discovery.








Abstract
The resorcinolic macrolide (RM) family comprises over 50 natural products with diverse biological activities, including the potent natural Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. Here, we report a modular and enantioselective synthetic strategy featuring a biomimetic macrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade that enables rapid access to natural and unnatural RMs. Using this route, we generated a small panel of minimal RMs, introducing covalent warheads, double bonds for macrocycle rigidification, and modifications at the C15 position, a position that has not been modified before. We also synthesized macrocyclic peptide&#8208;RM hybrids, offering a platform for rapid diversification. We evaluated all analogs for inhibitory activity against Hsp90&#945; and Hsp90&#946; and for disruption of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI). We found that introduction of polar groups at C15 improved Hsp90 activity relative to the representative RM de&#8208;O&#8208;methyllasiodiplodin, dependent on stereochemistry, whereas introduction of larger groups at C15 or introduction of a trans double bond into the macrocycle reduced activity. Two analogs with poor Hsp90 inhibitory activity exhibited dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF PPI. This work demonstrates that strategic modifications of a minimal RM scaffold through modular chemical insight can provide foundational structure&#8211;activity relationships for the class.

         <title>Organocatalytic Switches of DNA Glycosylase OGG1 Catalyze a Highly Efficient AP&#8208;Lyase Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic switches are small molecules that combine active site affinity and a nitrogen&#8208;centered base for catalysis, effectively removing the rate&#8208;determining step of the OGG1 biochemical cascade. Here, we identify a minimal structure and modulate the active nitrogen pKa, enabling the catalysis of ultrafast AP site incisions in a range of pH environments. Importantly, improved compounds exhibit potent anti&#8208;fibrotic effects in a patient&#8208;derived model of MASH.








Abstract
8&#8208;oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8&#8208;oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pKa is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches&#8211;4&#8208;anilino pyridines and 6&#8208;anilino pyrimidines&#8211;which are dimethyl&#8208;amino&#8208;pyridine (DMAP)&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) and electron&#8208;donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pKa less or equal to the assay pH is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC50 13&#160;nM, pKa 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient&#8208;derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.

         <title>Sulfate Recognition in Water via Charge&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dicationic tetralactam macrocycle achieves selective sulfate recognition in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal an entropy&#8208;driven mechanism enabled by electrostatic complementarity and desolvation. This work offers design principles for developing aqueous&#8208;phase receptors for sensing, separation, and catalysis.








Abstract
Achieving selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic anions in water remains a formidable challenge due to the competitive nature of water and the high hydration energies of target anions such as sulfate. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a simple dicationic tetralactam macrocycle (BPTL2&#8314;&#183;2Cl&#8315;) capable of binding highly hydrated anions in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal that BPTL2&#8314; exhibits a strong binding affinity for sulfate (Ka&#160;=&#160;2892&#160;M&#8315;&#185;), driven primarily by entropic gain from water release and reinforced by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;optimized structures confirm the formation of directional [N&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] and [C&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] hydrogen bonds. Comparative studies with a control macrocycle (6Na+&#8226;HCTL6&#8722;) that has a charge&#8208;neutral binding cavity underscore the essential role of cationic charge in overcoming desolvation enthalpic penalties. The receptor displays anti&#8208;Hofmeister selectivity, preferentially binding more hydrophilic anions. This work provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of anion recognition in water. It establishes charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding as a powerful strategy for developing next&#8208;generation receptors for sensing, separation, sequestration, transport, and catalysis in aqueous environments.

         <title>Formation Of Gold&#8208;Astatine Bonds in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the search for alternatives to the traditional astatoaryl bond, Au(I)&#9472;NHC complex was successfully radiolabeled with 211At by halide exchange and showed promising stability in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Mass spectrometry experiments coupled with relativistic DFT calculations support the superiority of Au(I) over Rh(I) and Ir(I) and give insights into the role of the NHC ligand in order to access stable 211At&#8208;compounds.








Abstract
With the purpose of exploring alternatives to the poorly stable astatoaryl bond found in most 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the coordination between astatine and metal&#8208;NHC (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes was investigated. To orient this work, relativistic DFT calculations were performed, highlighting a superiority of gold(I) over rhodium(I) and iridium(I), both regarding the strength of the metal&#8208;astatine bond and the metal's preference for astatine over other halogens. The DFT calculations also revealed a more stable metal&#8208;astatine bond with electron&#8208;withdrawing NHCs. Accordingly, two Au(I) complexes, [AuCl(IPr)] (IPr&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[2,6&#8208;(di&#8208;isopropyl)phenyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and [AuCl(IAd)] (IAd&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[adamantyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were radiolabeled by halide exchange in excellent radiochemical yields with iodine&#8208;125 and astatine&#8208;211 in a water/acetonitrile mixture with a reducing agent. While the adamantyl&#8208;substituted complex was not investigated further due to its lack of solubility in aqueous or semi aqueous media, the stability of [Au211At(IPr)] in the presence of phosphate&#8208;buffered saline was evaluated and proved excellent (96% after two half&#8208;lives), encouraging further studies with relevant cancer&#8208;targeting vectors.

         <title>Hybrid pH Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Through the Combination of the Ureido&#8211;Pyrimidinone Motif with &#946;&#8208;Sheet Peptide Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone motif with two different &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide sequences yielded supramolecular structures with significantly different morphologies in water. The resulting supramolecular nanostructures showed structural stability between pH = 5 and 9, while precipitation occurred at pH = 3.0 and random coil formation at pH 12. This work poses the basis for the development of novel responsive supramolecular polymers.








Abstract
Supramolecular biomaterials based on 1D supramolecular polymers in water replicate the fibrous and dynamic structures of natural architectures. Peptides, valued for their biocompatibility, are commonly employed as building blocks for supramolecular biomaterials, often in combination with large aromatic or hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups at the N&#8208;terminus to improve their structural stability. Herein, the self&#8208;assembly properties of two &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides combined with the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone self&#8208;dimerizing motif in aqueous solution are investigated in detail. The assembly of the resulting molecules is demonstrated to be intimately dependent on the &#946;&#8208;sheet sequence, while the incorporation of a hydrophobic spacer enhances the assembly of the monomers, irrespective of the peptide sequence employed. Furthermore, the assembly of each monomer is significantly enhanced at pH = 3.0 while being stable between pH = 5.0 and 9.0. Only at pH = 12, upon enolate formation, the transition to random coil conformation is observed for all the monomers. The supramolecular polymers developed hereby point to fundamental design principle toward the development of UPy&#8208;peptide based materials with tuneable properties and potential applications in the biomedical fields of research.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Talented Bismuthinidenes: Double C(sp3)&#9472;I Bond Activation Using Single or Two Bi Centers.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study illustrating a tunable reactivity for bismuthinidene complexes toward dihalomethanes is presented. Two types of double activation of C(sp3)&#9472;I bonds of diiodomethane were observed depending on the structure of the ligand. When a Dipp group was present on the nitrogen, the first C&#9472;I bond underwent oxidative addition (OA) toward the bismuth followed by alkylation of the imine function in cooperation with the ligand, whereas a double OA of two C&#9472;I bonds toward two bismuthinidene centers was observed for the tBu analogue.








Abstract
The reaction of [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi (1Dipp, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3) with CH2I2 proceeded via double C&#9472;I bond activation yielding [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,N)&#9472;CH2)I2 (3). By contrast, the reaction of 1Dipp with 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane provided [2,6&#8208;(DippN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]BiI2 (1DippI2) and ethene. The tert&#8208;butyl analogue [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi (1tBu) reacted with CH2ClX to give [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2Cl)X (X&#9552;I (4) or Cl (5)). Further, its reactivity with CH2I2 was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(I)}2(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,Bi)&#9472;CH2) (6) and [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2I)I (7). The reaction could be shifted in favor of 7 using an excess of CH2I2, but with 0.45 eq. of CH2I2 compound 6, as a product of double C&#9472;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of Hypermodified DNA Displaying a Combination of Thiol, Hydroxyl, Carboxylate, and Imidazole Functional Groups in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates bearing functional groups of amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) were synthesized and used for enzymatic synthesis of hypermodified DNA displaying these substituents in the major groove mimicking peptides or proteins.








Abstract
We designed and synthesized a set of six 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates (dNTPs) bearing functional groups mimicking amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) attached to position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of 7&#8208;deazapurines through different linkers. These modified dNTPs were studied as substrates in enzymatic synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA using several DNA polymerases. In primer extension (PEX), all modified dNTPs provided DNA containing one, two, three, or, (all) four modified nucleotides each bearing a different modification, although the thiol&#8208;modified dNTPs were worse substrates compared to the others. In PCR, we observed exponential amplification for any combination of one, two, or three nonsulfur dNTPs but the thiol&#8208;modified dNTP did not work well in any combinations. Sequencing of the hypermodified DNA confirmed the good fidelity of the incorporation of all the modified nucleotides. This set of modified dNTPs extends the portfolio of building blocks for prospective use in selections of functional nucleic acids.

         <title>From Desferrioxamine B Umpolung to an Enantiopure Bifunctional Chelator for 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional group transformations were performed at the pendent amine residue of desferrioxamine B (DFO), the commercial siderophore used in various medical applications, including iron decorporation, antibiotic development, and molecular imaging. Our results will broaden the scope of reactions, so far restricted to amide bond formation, for the functionalization of DFO with, for example, a chromophore, an additional ligand, a bioconjugable spacer.








Abstract
Promising results in preclinical diagnosis based on 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET have fostered the development of efficient chelators for this tetravalent metal. Leads in this area are octadentate ligands obtained by extension of the desferrioxamine B trihydroxamic acid DFO with a fourth bidentate ligand. In the approach reported here, the latter is a natural 6&#8208;membered cyclic hydroxamic acid deriving from (L)&#8208;ornithine. Its coupling to DFO via an (L)&#8208;lysine spacer required that the genuine amine function of the DFO terminus be changed to a carboxylic acid. Such a requirement prompted us to explore short sequences of chemical transformations that would challenge total syntheses leading to the same products. As a matter of fact, the target C&#8208;terminal DFO analogue was obtained in benzyl&#8208;protected form in three steps from commercially available DFO in 16% overall yield. Our short&#8208;step approach allowed us to implement other functionalities without DFO extension: &#8208;OH, &#8208;OTs, &#8208;CHO, &#8208;C(O)CH3, and &#8208;CH&#9552;CH2.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: from Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts. After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of organic photocatalysts employed in solution, or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Decarbonylation of a Metal Phosphaketene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of a metalated phosphastannene by reaction of the known cobalt(I) phosphaketene complex Co(DippPDI)(PCO) (DippPDI = 1,1'&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine) with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P=Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. This is facilitated by the fact that, on decarbonylation with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2, the carbon monoxide extruded from the phosphaketene precursor Co(DippPDI)(PCO) remains in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The novel phosphaketene compounds (IDipp)Au(PCO) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and (DippNacNac)Zn(PCO) (DippNacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) can be synthesized by reaction of Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} with Au(IDipp)Cl or (DippNacNac)ZnCl&#183;LiCl(OEt2)2, respectively. In the case of the former, the released stannylene Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 ultimately inserts into the Au&#8211;PCO bond affording the tin(IV) complex (IDipp)AuSn(PCO)[CH(SiMe3)2]2.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Thiol&#8208;ene Mediated Protocol for Thiolated Peptide Synthesis and On&#8208;Resin Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfhydryl groups unique nucleophilic and redox properties render it highly useful as a synthetic handle for the diversification of peptide structure, including macrocyclization, ligation, and bioconjugation. Herein, we demonstrated a sequential acyl&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol for selectively installing thiol residues onto bioactive peptides on&#8208;resin. Through judicious placement of appropriate unsaturated residues, the hydrothiolation/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic tool to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of disulfide&#8208;containing peptides displaying different ring sizes. Furthermore, a new and generally applicable fluorescent labeling strategy is introduced to facilitate direct on&#8208;resin conjugation without intermediate purification steps. These new methods provide a robust and versatile platform for peptide macrocyclization and bioconjugation, with broad applications in peptide synthesis and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridyl/Phenyl&#8208;Appended Acrylonitrile &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules: Thermally Stable Organic Crystals for Amplified Spontaneous Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly solid&#8208;state emissive molecular crystals have attracted attention as gain media for organic lasers. There is a need to develop solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules with excellent solubility and thermal stability through chemical design approaches despite the structural and functional diversity of organic molecular materials toward such media. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of the t&#8208;butyl&#8208; and pyridyl or phenyl&#8208;appended CDSBs. A solution process at room temperature could prepare each crystal of these molecules modified with pyridyl/phenyl. The crystal structure analysis results suggest that the difference in the pyridyl/phenyl group affects the crystal system. Solid&#8208;state emissions were similar due to the molecular structural differences affecting only the crystal structure. The emission spectrum of the crystal exhibited amplified spontaneous emission properties with the formation of population inversion. However, the pyridyl&#8211;pyridyl interactions contributed to the thermal stability of the crystal, which was stable even under high energy density laser irradiation. Therefore, molecular modification with the pyridyl group offers a new strategy for controlling crystal structures and rigid frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Activity in Fluorinated Binolate Ytterbium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral lanthanide complexes hold great potential in developing advanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range. While various ligands, such as &#946;&#8208;diketonates and biphenols, have been successfully used to sensitize NIR emission of lanthanide ions, little attention has been paid to regulating CPL behaviors via ligand modification. In this study, we report the synthesis, structure, luminescence and chiroptical properties of a pair of novel air&#8208;stable Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8217;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL). Compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, these fluorinated complexes exhibit larger dihedral angles between the two naphthyl moieties and more distorted octahedral coordination environments around the Yb(III) ion, leading to increased overall crystal field splitting. These structural modifications result in enhanced photophysical properties: the luminescence lifetime (&#964;obs), sensitization efficiency (&#951;sens) and quantum yield (QY) improve from 2.1 &#956;s, 38% and 0.7% to 2.7 &#956;s, 63% and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the dissymmetry factor (glum) and CPL brightness (BCPL) at 963 nm increase by 32% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The scope of such chemical modification is broad,&#160;encompassing a variety of BINOL derivatives, offering a unique platform to further elucidate the relationship between structural and electronic properties and CPL activity in lanthanide systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Cage Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cages are a robust class of molecular hosts with a myriad of applications in materials science. Despite this, there has been a paucity of explorations into the modification of their properties via external functionalization. In this work, [n]rotaxanes featuring unoccupied organic cages as stopper components and a small 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle were constructed using the active metal template approach. By exploiting a scrambling methodology, it was possible to synthesise cages with a defined number of interlocked components (n = 2&#8208;4). The gas uptake, solubility and thermal properties of the interlocked systems were compared against those of their constituent, non&#8208;interlocked components. In this manner, we were able to demonstrate the potential of exploiting the mechanical bond for modulating the physiochemical properties of these molecular materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic cages are a robust class of molecular hosts with a myriad of applications in materials science. Despite this, there has been a paucity of explorations into the modification of their properties via external functionalization. In this work, [n]rotaxanes featuring unoccupied organic cages as stopper components and a small 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine macrocycle were constructed using the active metal template approach. By exploiting a scrambling methodology, it was possible to synthesise cages with a defined number of interlocked components (n = 2-4). The gas uptake, solubility and thermal properties of the interlocked systems were compared against those of their constituent, non-interlocked components. In this manner, we were able to demonstrate the potential of exploiting the mechanical bond for modulating the physiochemical properties of these molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of amines into peptides via an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence provides access to a wide variety of modifications, including amine&#8208;based metal ligands. Primary, secondary, and aromatic amines, as well as heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles, have been successfully incorporated into the reaction sequence. Particularly basic amines or ammonium chlorides can also be used successfully with acid or base additives.








Abstract
Late&#8208;stage peptide modification is a powerful tool for rapidly generating a library of peptide mimetics, for example, for drug discovery or catalyst development. While late&#8208;stage modifications exist for many types of structural features, methods for introducing amines into peptides via a late&#8208;stage approach are rare, despite their enormous potential for the development of peptide therapeutics. Here we present a protocol for introducing amines into peptides by our established on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach. Our method is compatible with a wide variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, anilines, and other heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles mostly giving good to excellent yields. We introduce amines that are pharmacologically relevant as well as those that can impart catalytic or metal&#8208;binding properties into the peptide of interest. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we introduce the metal ligand tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (tren) into a tryptophan zipper scaffold using our late&#8208;stage amination approach to explore metal&#8208;induced stapling. Indeed, metal complexation via the tren ligand resulted in a thermal stabilization of more than 30&#160;K in one of our tryptophan zipper designs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Fluorescent Probe for Lipid Droplets and Endoplasmic Reticulum Using Bay&#8208;Region Substituted Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the complex cellular microenvironment, lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Their interactions are crucial for regulating processes such as lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, simultaneously monitoring these two organelles remains a challenging task. In this study, a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted perylene diimides (PDIs) based probe, LD&#8208;ER&#8208;PDI, by incorporating a 2&#8208;azetidinone substituent in the bay&#8208;region and two distinct targeting groups for LDs and ER at opposite ends of the imide positions was development, enabling discrimination between LDs and ER. Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid&#8208;treated conditions and also allows real&#8208;time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER. This work not only provides a valuable tool for studying the dynamic interactions between LDs and ER but also highlights a strategy for designing dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling CoOx@NC&#160;with NiFe LDH Enhances Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Rechargeable High&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale composite of NiFe LDH nanosheets anchored on Co&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich carbon and interconnected CNT framework ((CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe), prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal route, exhibits excellent OER and ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, which is comparable to and even exceeds that of representative bifunctional electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional catalysts with the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities is of great significance in improving the efficiency of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, this study adopts simple one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal strategies to prepare a high&#8208;performance bifunctional composite catalyst by coupling a layered hydroxide NiFe LDH with Co and N codoped carbon framework, composed of cobalt oxide and metallic Co nanoparticles distributed on interconnected porous carbon nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Benefiting from the exposure of more active sites, high conductivity, and beneficial charge transport advantages, the best catalyst (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and stability for oxygen&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, exhibiting a low potential gap of 0.757&#160;V. Additionally, the rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery assembled with the (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe catalyst performs a peak power density of 136&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a specific capacity of 803&#160;mAh&#160;gZn&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and outstanding stability (over 200&#160;hours). This work presents a simple and low&#8208;cost approach for synthesizing bifunctional catalysts to realize efficient and durable rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assemblies of a concaved aromatic host as electron donor (D) and a cationic heterocyclic guest as electron acceptor (A) are reported. These molecular units were noncovalently bound to afford charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes in solution and a CT co&#8208;crystal, displaying drastic color change from colorless to orange. The binding motif of the assemblies in the solution state was analyzed by NMR spectroscopic analysis and visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations for the assemblies revealed electronic communication between the D and A fragments, proving their CT characteristics. The CT complexes were stabilized by not only CT and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions but also coulomb interaction between cationic acceptor unit and its anion supported by a hydrogen bond with a hydroxy group in the aromatic host, resulted in enhancement of orbital overlapping of the D&#8208;A fragments. Owing to the strong D&#8208;A interaction in the assemblies, the CT complexes undergo ultrafast charge recombination on a femtosecond timescale after photoexcitation of the CT transition, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that understanding of assembly motif and its noncovalent interactions can lead to create optical materials manupulating electron transition dynamics.</dc:description>

Bifunctional Chiral ImPy&#8208;Carbene Ligands. H&#8208;Bonding Controlled Reactivity and Enantioselectivity in Au(I)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands have been devised for enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. Based on a single C&#8208;stereogenic center derived from chiral pool &#945;&#8208;aminoacids and connecting an imidazopyridine core to an arylurea motif, enantioselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions could be achieved. High enantioselectivities were notably observed for substrates presenting a pendant propargyl alcohol on 2&#8208;naphthol and 1,6&#8208;enyne scaffolds. In the latter case, the catalyst shows a high degree of selectivity for the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig biscyclization of these substrates to give cyclopropyl&#8208;fused 6&#8208;ring heterocycles with a free OH functionality instead of the previously reported furan&#8208;fused products. This unusual selectivity was investigated by DFT studies, which suggested the dual role of the carbonyl group of the urea moiety: first as H&#8208;bond acceptor in the catalytic cycle to direct the enantioselectivity, second as a cooperative group in the hydrogen shift leading to deauration.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization, Fragmentation and Expansion of cyclo&#8208;P4R2 Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, three isolobal complexes of the form [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8209;P4R2)]+ ({LnM}&#160;= {CpMo(CO)2} (A), {Cp'''Ni} (B), {Cp'''Co}&#8211; (C), R = Ph, iPr; Cp''' = 1,2,4&#8209;tBu3C5H2) are reacted with nucleophilic carbenes (L). While C does not show any reactivity, the cationic complexes A and B undergo addition reactions. The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(&#951;3&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (1a &#8211; d) and [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (3a &#8211; d) show different geometries for L&#8208;P3PR2 ligands. Their reactivity towards EtO&#8211; results in either a simple addition (for 1) or a complex addition, ring&#8208;opening, rearrangement sequence (for 3). Moreover, [Cp'''Ni(&#951;2&#8208;IDippPP(OEt)PPiPr2)] (4) could be methylated by reaction with MeOTf, which affords an iso&#8208;tetraphosphine ligand, marking the first example of complete functionalization of a polyphosphorus ligand to a complexed phosphine. Mechanistic studies differentiate the influence of the isolobal {CpMo(CO)2}, {Cp'''Ni}, and {Cp'''Co}&#8211; transition metal units. Lastly, 3a&#8211;d were chosen as model substrates for further nucleophilic functionalization. In this regard, 3 reacts with [CN]&#8208; in a [3+1] fragmentation reaction affording the dimerized species [{Cp'''Ni}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4(PR2)2)] (6a: R = Ph, 6b: R&#160;=&#160;iPr) together with IDippP&#8208;CN. In contrast, the reaction with [ECO]&#8208; (E = P, As) led to an extension of the pnictogen framework yielding [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;EP4Ph2IDipp)] (8a: E = P, 8b: E = As).</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Strategy Steers the Structural Evolution of Cu Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane (CH4), offers a promising pathway to address the dual challenges of climate change and energy shortage. Although copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) have proven to be promising CO2RR catalysts for hydrocarbon production, their uncontrollable structural reconstruction under operating conditions leads to elusive active sites. Herein, we demonstrate that a pulsed potential electrolysis strategy with well&#8208;designed pulse parameters can steer the dynamic reconstruction of Cu&#8208;MOFs to customize the active sites to enable CH4 formation pathway. Mechanistic studies using electron microscopic and spectroscopic methods indicated that constant&#8208;potential electrolysis caused the rapid reduction of Cu&#8208;MOF to metallic Cu nanoparticles, whereas pulsed electrolysis enabled the controlled generation of active Cu2O/CuO nanoclusters. Benefiting from this, the pulsed system delivers an exceptional Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.9% in CH4 production from the CO2RR. This selectivity markedly surpasses that of the constant&#8208;potential counterpart, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In addition, this approach facilitates stable CH4 production for over 12 h while maintaining an FE above 60%.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Driven Ion Pumps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8217;s molecular machinery has long provided inspiration for the development of functional materials, with natural ion pumps exemplifying the efficient conversion of solar energy into directional ion transport. This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light&#8208;driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light&#8208;driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric&#8208;driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light&#8208;induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light&#8208;driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Anhydride&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Anthraquinones and Anthrones via Unusual Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method to transform 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones and anthrones has been developed using Tf2O as an inexpensive and readily available mediator via unusual intramolecular rearrangement. This work expands the utility of Tf2O in complex molecular transformations and offers valuable contributions to the synthesis of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Triflic anhydride (Tf2O) is a potent electrophilic activator for carbonyl groups, facilitating the formation of versatile triflate intermediates that undergo nucleophilic trapping to generate a broad array of valuable compounds. In this work, we have developed a novel method that utilizes Tf2O as a mediator for carbonyl activation and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement of 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones 2 and anthrones 3. Both anthraquinones and anthrones are important molecules in the fields of natural products research, pharmaceuticals, and traditional Chinese medicines. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed involving Tf2O&#8208;mediated activation, carbocation formation, nucleophilic addition, and intramolecular cyclization, ultimately leading to the formation of anthraquinones and anthrones. The developed methodology is both operationally simple and convenient, without the need for an inert atmosphere. This study broadens the scope of Tf2O utility and extends the practical application of intriguing intramolecular rearrangement to the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

         <title>The Evolution of Fluorescein into A Potential Theranostic Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study successfully evolved a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic compound. By functionalizing fluorescein, we enhanced its fluorescence and adapted it for multicomponent reactions (MCRs). We synthesized over 20 compounds across four diverse scaffolds. Compound 5e shows strong 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibition, favorable properties and cell permeability, making it ideal for imaging and screening assays.








Abstract
Recent advances in drug discovery and development have been marked by the emergence of new modalities, including small molecule theranostic agents. While initial results from clinical trials have been promising, modern detectable inhibitors are still in an early stage of development. In this study, we present a strategy for chemically evolving a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic entity, which not only retains its properties but also enhances its inhibition and detection applicability. By utilizing 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 as a model system, we leverage prior knowledge of its inhibitors to rationally functionalize fluorescein, enabling the targeted and highly efficient synthesis of over 20 derivatives across four different scaffolds. This approach ultimately led to the development of a potent, cell&#8208;permeable inhibitor that effectively engages its target in live cells and enables real&#8208;time visualization. These findings validate our new strategy for the development of small molecule diagnostic modulators, paving the way for application in other targets as well.

Three heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters with the formulas [LnIII2CoII5(L1)2(L2)2(L3)2(OAc)4(NO3)2]&#183;4CH3CN (LnIII&#160;=&#160;Gd (1), Tb (2), and Dy (3); HL1 = (E)&#8208;1&#8208;((2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methoxybenzylidene)amino)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, HL2&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;aminonaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, and HL3&#160;=&#160;trimethylopropane) have been obtained via self&#8208;assembly of mixed ligands strategy. Significantly, cluster 1 displays a larger magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (&#8722;&#916;Sm&#160;=&#160;36.83&#160;J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.0&#160;K and 7.0 T), while cluster 3 shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior under zero dc field. Moreover, clusters 1&#8211;3 as heterogeneous catalysts can effectively convert CO2 with epoxides and benzylamine to form oxazolidinones under mild conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first reported bifunctional heterometallic heptanuclear clusters which show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework&#8211;Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reviews recent advances in COF&#8208;based ionic conductors for PEMFCs, covering their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies for enhancing proton conductivity and mechanical stability are analyzed, along with challenges in membrane durability and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF&#8208;based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF&#8208;modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next&#8208;generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton&#8208;conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.

         <title>Impacts of Chalcogen Bonding on the Stability and Reactivity of 5&#8208;Iminothianthrene Platform: Toward Electrophilic Nitrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and iso(thio)cyanates, to afford the corresponding adducts. Intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified through natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis based on their X&#8208;ray crystal structures. The potential of these adducts as electrophilic aminating reagents was demonstrated.








Abstract
The thianthrene scaffold has recently attracted significant attention in various coupling reactions. Although 5&#8208;iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5&#8208;iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity. Finally, the potential of N&#8208;acyliminothianthrenes as N&#8208;acylnitrene equivalents was demonstrated.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted N&#8208;Isopropylacrylamide Nanogel Synthesis: Exploring the Role of Reaction Parameters and Cross&#8208;linking Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as an efficient method for preparing PNIPAM based nanogels. Using crosslinkers like EGDMA and BAC, their effects on structure, temperature responsiveness, and stability were analyzed. Microwave irradiation shows its potential in nanogel synthesis. Stability studies in biologically relevant media highlight their potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
This study provides a detailed account of the use of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as a novel and efficient method for preparing monodisperse poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanogels. The synthesis, based on free radical precipitation copolymerization of NIPAM and crosslinkers in water, was accelerated by microwave irradiation. Crosslinkers such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and degradable bis&#8208;acryloylcystamine (BAC) were employed to study their effects on nanogel structure and properties, including their temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. HPLC analysis revealed differences in monomer and crosslinker conversion between the two agents. The growth of the nanogel particles was analyzed at various polymerization times using dynamic light scattering (DLS), &#950;&#8208;potential measurements, and cryo&#8208;TEM imaging. The data showed that microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis reduced reaction time from 6 hours to minutes. BAC produced uniformly cross&#8208;linked nanogels, whereas EGDMA formed nanogels with dense cores and loose PNIPAM shells. Stability studies during storage and in biologically relevant media indicated their potential for biomedical applications.

         <title>Conclusive Insight into the Coordination Complexes of a Flexible Bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) Ligand and Their Phase&#8208;Dependent Structure: A Multi&#8208;Technique Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes of flexible bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722; are dimeric in the crystalline state but rearrange to monomeric in organic solution. The transformation, first detected on paramagnetic VO2+ and Co2+ derivatives, is conclusively proved through the preparation of diamagnetic [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] and its investigation by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2.








Abstract
Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin&#8208;free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3&#8208;phenylene bridge (H2bdhb&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1&#8208;hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb2&#8722; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)2(bdhb)2] (1) and [Co2(bdhb)2(py)4] (2), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb2&#8722; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi&#8208;macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn2+ analogue of 1 and 2, namely [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] (3). Although both 2 and 3 are dimeric and contain the same ligands, 3 features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI&#8208;MS spectra of 3 in THF and CH2Cl2 contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on J&#8208;coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of 3 into quasi&#8208;macrocyclic monomers in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2 solution at room temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin-free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;-diketonato) ligand bdhb&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3-phenylene bridge (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bdhb&#160;=&#160;1,3-bis(3,5-dioxo-1-hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bdhb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bdhb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi-macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high-resolution &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; analogue of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, namely [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bdhb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Although both &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are dimeric and contain the same ligands, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI-MS spectra of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; in THF and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; into quasi-macrocyclic monomers in THF-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ir/Ni Metallaphotoredox Catalysis for the C(sp3)&#9472;H Bond &#945;&#8208;Arylation and Alkylation of N&#8208;Alkyl N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox system enables the regioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles via C(sp3)&#9472;H bond functionalization. This method bypasses traditional Sn2 pathways and offers complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis. The approach shows good substrate scope and high yields, with mechanistic studies supporting the arylation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals generated through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).








Abstract
In this work, we report a regioselective C(sp3)&#9472;H bond &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles (carbazoles, indoles and indazoles) using a Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox catalysis. This approach enables the direct functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position of nitrogen heterocycles, offering an efficient alternative to traditional Sn2 methods and providing complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis, which often results in C(sp2)&#9472;H bond arylation. The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as the photocatalyst and NiCl2(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross&#8208;coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom&#8208;economical route to synthesizing valuable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl heterocycles.

         <title>Formation of Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;Like Polyoxidovanadates at 37&#176;C Upon Reaction of VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 With Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At physiological temperature in NaCl solutions, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] reacts with lysozyme forming mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates which covalently bind to the protein surface.








Abstract
Crystals of the model protein lysozyme were grown and soaked with the potential drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 at 37&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data collected at this temperature reveal that mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadate clusters are formed and covalently bind protein residue side chains at physiological temperature.

         <title>Selective Sequestration of Palladium(II) Cations Using a Supramolecular Polymer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;based ligand is shown to selectively complex Pd(II) cations from an aqueous mixed&#8208;metal solution. Selectivity for Pd(II) is imparted in a copolymer when functionalized with the same ligand, demonstrating the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in metal recovery systems.








Abstract
The selective sequestration of aqueous palladium from waste is an attractive option for metal recovery. However, achieving good metal specificity remains a difficult problem. In this study, we present the synthesis of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular system based on a 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating ligand group. Excellent selectivity for Pd(II) ions over Pt(II), Ni(II), Fe(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) from a mixed&#8208;metal solution was demonstrated through ESI&#8208;MS and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies of a model ligand system. Following this, a water&#8208;soluble copolymer system containing 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole functional groups was prepared. This polymer was shown to exhibit the same specificity for Pd(II) in a mixed&#8208;metal solution, quantitatively supported by dialysis and ICP&#8208;MS experiments. These findings demonstrate the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in selective metal recovery.

         <title>The Vicinal&#8208;Diiodination of the HDDA&#8208;Benzynes by N&#8208;Iodo&#8208; succinimide (NIS) Through a Radical Pathway</title>

         <dc:description>
The discovery and development of radical iodine trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes is reported. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide serves as the source of iodine radicals and EPR spectral analysis of reaction mixture supports the existence of radical intermediates. Control experiments suggest that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation This work represents the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.








Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;diradical reactivity of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes (thermal) has not been explored well in comparison to their ionic reactivity. Accordingly, the radical trapping reactions of these reactive intermediates are very scarce in literature. Herein, we report the iodine&#8208;radical trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of structurally divergent vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) has been employed as the source of radical iodine under thermal heating conditions. The existence of the arene&#8208;radical intermediates and the radical mechanism has been supported by the EPR spectral analysis of the reaction mixture. Several fruitful control experiments suggested that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation. The process is general in terms of substituents on the diynes as well as the nature of the tethering units. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.

         <title>Transition Metal/Metal Sulfide Heterostructures Boost Energy Saving Hydrogen Production Coupled with Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a bifunctional electrode with an inner Cr layer and outer components of Co, Mo, and the Co9S8 phase (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S) through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization. Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, the coupled electrolysis system demonstrates excellent performance for energy saving hydrogen production and sulfur recovery.








Abstract
Hydrogen production through the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising pathway for sustainable and green energy. Coupling HER with the thermodynamically favorable sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) can reduce energy consumption and recycle industrial by&#8208;product S2&#8722;. However, the development and practical application are hindered by the lack of cost&#8208;effective and robust catalysts. Herein, we constructed a bifunctional electrode with rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures using NiFe foam through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S). Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, it delivers outstanding SOR and HER performance. The integrated cell, utilizing the NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S electrode for both the cathode and anode, achieves a remarkable cell voltage of 0.75 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 1.43 V lower than conventional water electrolysis. It demonstrates extraordinary long&#8208;term durability over 1100 hours without significant decay, achieving high Faradaic efficiencies (&#8805;99%) and low electricity consumption (1.79 kWh m&#8722;3 H2) for hydrogen production. This work paves the way for environmentally friendly strategies, combining cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production with value&#8208;added sulfur recovery, offering a reliable option for bifunctional catalyst design.

         <title>Recent Advances in Detergent Chemistry and Handling Support Membrane Protein Analysis Including Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ionic detergents are key reagents for the characterization of membrane protein drug targets. Suitable detergents are commonly identified by trial and error, which leads to failed preparations and raising costs. Recent findings suggest that not only the chemistry of detergents but also the strategy with which detergents and proteins are brought together impact the successes of investigations. To facilitate the future development of non&#8208;ionic detergents in membrane protein research, herein, we review chemical design concepts and detergent exchange strategies for a successful integration of detergents into the analysis of challenging membrane protein complexes. Our overview reveals exciting opportunities to tackle existing challenges, including the stabilization of G&#8208;protein coupled receptors, the development of fluorinated detergents for studying protein&#8208;lipid binding, top&#8208;down design of detergents, and hybrid detergents for the identification of non&#8208;canonical lipid associations to proteins with relevance to antibiotic research. Our review will facilitate the development of chemical tools for the biophysical characterization of membrane proteins and support the discovery of biological findings in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fascinating properties introduced by the breaking of the mirror symmetry have recently motivated a rising interest in chirality in nanomaterials. In particular, transition metal dichalcogenides are a wide group of technologically relevant two&#8208;dimensional layered materials where recent efforts in the introduction of chirality have shown promising results, attracting great attention for future studies and potential applications. This review article is focused on the development of chirality in transition metal dichalcogenide nanostructures, dealing with the synthetic strategies that have been adopted to produce chiral TMDs both via solution&#8208;phase and vapor&#8208;phase syntheses along with the characterization of their chiroptical properties. A broad range of examples, including a variety of nanostructures such as 0D quantum dots, 1D nanotubes, 2D flakes and more complex 3D nanostructures as well as different origins of the chirality are considered. Critical analysis of potential pitfalls in the assessment of the materials&#8217; chirality are discussed. A broad range of exciting properties and applications associated with the materials&#8217; chirality, including: nanomedicine, enantioselective catalysis, spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, spintronics and non&#8208;linear optics are also presented in the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of potent mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate derivatives as ligands for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R using fluorescence polarization assay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cation&#8208;independent mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate/IGF2 receptor (CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R) plays a crucial role in transporting lysosomal enzymes and other ligands. In this study, we designed and synthesized novel, stable mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their affinity for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R. To evaluate binding potency, we employed a sensitive and cost&#8208;effective fluorescence polarization assay, enabling rapid quantification of receptor&#8208;ligand interactions in solution. The tested compounds included di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides, alongside various M6P&#8208;derived small molecules featuring phosphate isosteres or other functional modifications. Our findings indicate that ligands bearing multiple M6P moieties exhibit significantly higher receptor affinity than monomeric compounds and that phosphonate groups may serve as a more stable and potent alternative to native M6P. Computational modeling of ligand interactions with CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R domains further elucidated the binding mechanisms, offering new directions for the development of even more effective ligands. This study advances the design of therapeutic strategies that leverage CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R for targeted biomolecule delivery to lysosomes, opening new possibilities for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible, Perfluorinated Analogue of Aluminum Fumarate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis of Al&#8208;TFS, a novel aluminum metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based on tetrafluorosuccinic acid (H2TFS), of formula Al(OH)(TFS)&#183;1.5H2O, introducing a new member to the family of perfluorinated MOFs. The structure of the MOF, solved ab&#8208;initio from laboratory powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, displays structural analogies with that of the commercially available Al&#8208;fumarate (Basolite A520). The structure is composed of 1D infinite OH&#8208;bridged Al octahedra chains connected by the dicarboxylic linkers, designing rhombic channels decorated by fluorine atoms. Upon water removal, the MOF undergoes a phase transition leading to a moderate expansion of the unit cell. Volumetric analysis revealed the presence of ultra&#8208;micropores with a size lower than 4 &#197;. Gas sorption measurements demonstrated for Al&#8208;TFS a slightly higher CO2 selectivity compared to N2 and CH4 than the Al&#8208;fumarate analogue, with peculiar shapes of the isotherms suggesting a dynamic response of the framework to CO2 adsorption. Using different complementary techniques (in situ infrared spectroscopy, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas/vapor sorption), and density functional theory simulations, the flexibility of the new MOF was disclosed, highlighting the significant impact of fluorination in tailoring materials with structural flexibility and peculiar adsorption properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallisation&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has been extensively studied for the formation of bespoke nanoparticles and provides a unique way to control the unidirectional growth of block copolymers (BCPs). Currently, oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles represent an under&#8208;researched area in the literature, stemming from the difficulty in synthesising organic nanoparticles with higher&#8208;order morphologies using traditional techniques. These oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles have uses as components in products as diverse as electronics and engine oils, with current research determining a strong relationship between morphology and performance, with anisotropic nanoparticles outperforming spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the facile self&#8208;assembly of polyester&#8208;based BCPs in n&#8208;octane to achieve low&#8208;dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. This report focuses on using tuneable, oil&#8208;soluble polymers and aims to understand their self&#8208;assembly in n&#8208;octane through the variation of self&#8208;assembly conditions and unimer solubility to form nanoparticles of a controlled and variable size.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispidine&#8208;Based Copper(II) Coordination Polymers with Remarkable Dynamic Properties, Selective Volatile Organic Compounds Adsorption and Exchange Capabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents novel Cu(II)&#8208;based bispidine coordination polymers (CPs) with remarkable dynamic properties, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exchange and selective adsorption capabilities. The coordination requirements of Cu(II) enable, as demonstrated by SC&#8208;XRD and P&#8208;XRD, the formation of either 1D ribbon&#8208;like (1&#8208;TCMSC and 1&#8208;H2OSC) and 2D (1&#8208;MeCNSC) extended frameworks depending on the ability of&#160;trapped solvents to interact as hydrogen bond (HB) donor with the metal&#160;counterion. Hirshfeld Surface analysis and in situ VT SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD experiments reveal different interchain interactions in 1D vs. 2D CPs. Solvent exchange experiments on both single crystals and microcrystalline samples, set up to evaluate differences in the CPs&#160;dynamic nature, confirm the drastic effect of CP dimensionality. Additionally, amorphous desolvated phase 1&#8208;AmorphPwd was tested for VOC adsorption displaying affinity for acetonitrile and nitromethane, with high selectivity for the latter, but also having the ability to trap aromatic VOCs, capturing up to ca. 2 mmol/g of solvent. The adsorption experiments, conducted at r.t., 1 atm and no prior activation, underscore the potential of these materials for environmental and industrial applications. This work emphasizes the unique dynamic and selective behavior of bispidine&#8208;based CPs and provides foundation for their scalability and practical implementation in VOC capture technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Matrix Isolation and Solvation of the Benzonitrile Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvated electrons, one of the strongest reducing agents, exhibit short lifetimes in the range of pico&#8208; to milliseconds when generated photochemically or by radiolysis in solution. In contrast, solvated electrons produced using sodium metal in liquid ammonia are stable for days and have long been used in synthetic chemistry. Using sodium atoms as an electron source, we were able to trap solvated electrons in low&#8208;density amorphous (LDA) water ice matrices with lifetimes of several days and use these electrons as reducing reagent. In LDA matrices doped with benzonitrile 1 these electrons react with 1 to form the benzonitrile radical anion 2. In argon matrices, in the absence of water, only small amounts of 2 were observed after deposition, and most of the sodium and 1 remained unreacted. The yield of radical anion 2 is significantly higher in amorphous water ice than in solid argon. The photoexcitation of radical anion 2 in both argon and LDA water ice matrices resulted in a reversal of the electron transfer under back formation of benzonitrile 1. Annealing of argon matrices doped with small amounts of water containing 2 resulted in the formation of 1:1 and 2:1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes between water and radical anion 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Chromophore Construction via Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Caprolactam and Itaconic Acid: Mechanistic Validation Enabled by 3D&#8208;Printed Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam and itaconic acid can produce a fluorescent&#8208;colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining non&#8208;crystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf&#8208;like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using FT&#8208;IR, NMR, HPLC, and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via &#960;&#8208;electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP), as a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, its key challenge is to construct photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark. Herein, four cases of transition metal and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO2, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM&#8208;based materials to be used in the PECCP field for the first time.Under illumination, the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8722;465 mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175 mV were significantly lower than that of TiO2 (&#8722;97 mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO2ensures Bi&#8208;POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stably and sustainably cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile, cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N co&#8208;doped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal&#8208;free and binder&#8208;free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;5, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10and CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde&#8208;dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate. Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD&#8208;N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder&#8208;free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behaviour. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5,000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22 Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00 W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3 V LED bulb.</dc:description>

         <title>An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free synthesis of ritlecitinib employs asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary with titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;). This one&#8208;pot process couples a ketone&#8208;amino acid with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (85% yield, 86:14 dr). Cyclization affords a &#948;&#8208;lactam (60%), transformed into ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence (62% overall yield), avoiding precious metals and hazardous reagents in chiral piperidine assembly.








Abstract
We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;) reductive system to achieve a one&#8208;pot condensation&#8208;reduction of the ketone&#8208;amino acid derivative with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di&#8208;amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid&#8208;mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;&#8208;lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.

     alt="An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)-&#945;-Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metal-free synthesis of ritlecitinib employs asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary with titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;). This one-pot process couples a ketone-amino acid with (S)-&#945;-methylbenzylamine (85% yield, 86:14 dr). Cyclization affords a &#948;-lactam (60%), transformed into ritlecitinib via a five-step sequence (62% overall yield), avoiding precious metals and hazardous reagents in chiral piperidine assembly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;) reductive system to achieve a one-pot condensation-reduction of the ketone-amino acid derivative with (S)-&#945;-methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di-amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid-mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;-lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five-step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Process for Preparing Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composites Based on Carbon&#8208;Based Quantum Dots and Their Derivatives as Drug Delivery Systems for Andrographolide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Andrographolide (ADG) was conjugated with MOFs (MIL&#8208;53(Al), ZIF&#8208;8) carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (CBQDs) and doped carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (D&#8208;CBQDs) using the green approach of high&#8208;pressure (0.3&#160;GPa) solid phase contact. This method enhances the drug solubility, as indicated by changes in hydrophobicity observed via 1H NMR.








Abstract
Andrographolide (ADG) was conjugated with MIL&#8208;53(Al), ZIF&#8208;8, carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (CBQDs) and doped carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (D&#8208;CBQDs) using high&#8208;pressure (0.3&#160;GPa) contact. This solvent&#8208;free approach is environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient, and time&#8208;saving, resulting in ADG&#8208;MOFs&#8208;CBQDs/D&#8208;CBQDs with physical properties comparable to those produced by traditional liquid phase encapsulation. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, XRD, TGA, FT&#8208;IR, and 1H NMR. The results indicate that ADG was partly encapsulated within the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) pores, while another portion was bound externally to CBQD/D&#8208;CBQDs, as evidenced by distinct drug signals in each analysis. This green synthesis approach simplifies the conjugation process. It significantly enhances the drug solubility, as indicated by changes in hydrophobicity observed via 1H NMR, surpassing the improvements achieved by ADG encapsulation within MOFs alone. Additionally, in preliminary tests, the materials exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PC3 cells compared to ADG (25.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.06&#160;&#181;g/mL) after 48&#160;hours of exposure.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Fixation of CO2 to Form N&#8208;Containing Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the research progress of various typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds in the past five years, detailing the catalytic performance and principles of promising catalysts. Finally, this pathway's development trends and characteristics are summarized and prospected.








Abstract
N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO2 as a C1 source for synthesizing N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO2 and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO2 conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds converted from CO2, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.

         <title>Synthesis of a Station&#8208;Less Molecular Daisy Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A daisy chain compound lacking intercomponent recognition motifs is synthesized and analyzed. As a result of the absence of intercomponent recognition motifs there was also no preferred conformation of the interlocked components observed.








Abstract
A daisy chain architecture without a preferred low energy arrangement of the mechanically linked components is presented. The molecular design combines a rigid&#8208;rod type oligophenylene ethynylene subunit with an oligoethylene glycol macrocycle that features a bipyridine coordination site. The daisy chain dimer was synthesized via kinetic trapping of the interlocked structure using a Cadiot&#8211;Chodkiewicz active metal template reaction. Comparison of the isolated interlocked dimer with its monomeric analogue indicates the presence of a variety of different geometries for the molecular daisy chain. The dynamic sliding motion in the daisy chain is studied by variable temperature UV&#8211;vis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments, which point to a highly mobile system even at low temperatures.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have garnered significant attention due to their enhanced chemical, physical, and binding properties in comparison to natural nucleic acids. This prompted their application in antigene/antisense approach, assigning them a pivotal role in gene editing and, more recently, showing their potential as &#8220;bilingual&#8221; molecules being able &#8220;to speak&#8221; both nucleic acid and protein language. However, in order to expand the applications of PNAs in therapy, the challenge of effectively delivering PNAs to cells needs to be addressed. Among several delivery approaches employed so far, the nanotechnology&#8208;based ones showed great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest in the field (2019 to present), beginning from the &#8220;old fashioned&#8221; peptide&#8208;based delivery systems, as well as cutting&#8208;edge approaches involving nanoparticles, liposomes, calixarene, showing how they have inspired the development of smarter delivery approaches to boost PNAs applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quercetin&#183;Zirconium Metal Complexes: Insights from Femto to Millisecond Photobehavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT&#183;Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, and water, the UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50 &#8208; 100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 &#8208; 14 &#180; 109 M&#8208;2). While the formation of charge&#8208;transfer states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal&#8208;bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT&#183;Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N-dimethylformamide, and water, the UV-visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50 - 100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 - 14 &#180; 109 M-2). While the formation of charge-transfer states through ligand-to-metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal-bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry of Ditellurides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry enables the exploration of reversible chemical exchange reactions. Here, we report studies on the dynamic Te&#8208;Te bond exchange of chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides using 125Te NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi&#8208;component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te&#8208;Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperature, in the absence of visible light and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride&#8208;ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non&#8208;synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen&#8208;chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te&#8208;Te &gt; Te&#8208;Se &gt; Te&#8208;S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Singlet Oxygen Monitoring in Aqueous Media Comprising a Polymer&#8208;imbedded Eu3+ Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet dioxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role as the active agent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment, as well as in the photo&#8208;inactivation of antibiotic&#8208;resistant microbes (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, aPDT). The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of &#185;O&#8322; following its photo&#8208;catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to &#185;O&#8322; through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500&#8208;fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 &#181;s and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high surface charge (&gt; +30 mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary &#8216;proof of principle&#8217; staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time gated measurements, i.e., to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic regeneration of NADH represents an effective means of mimicking photosynthesis, but confronts the challenges of the charge separation, electron transfer, and the selectivity control in the surface reduction stage. Herein, we report a multifunctional composite material that embeds &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked nano TPTTA covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and electron mediator (rhodium complex) into a functional mesoporous silica matrix for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This strategy enables the facilitation of the electron transfer process while maintaining the intrinsic properties of the COFs, providing flexibility in COFs design. The strategic integration of electron mediator and the shortened charge migration path due to the nanosized COFs results in a NADH regeneration yield of 75.7% and a selectivity of 89.8% for 1,4&#8208;NADH. The initial reaction rate for NADH regeneration attained 8.7 gNADH&#8226;gCat&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1, and the system showed no decrease in activity after 4 reaction cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of the cis&#8208;Eunicellane Cyclase AriE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of a cis&#8208;eunicellane cyclase, AriED128A, was determined through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis explored the cyclization mechanism of AriE, in which W73 is a crucial regulatory hotspot that controls product diversity through cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our research provides the first structural insights into eunicellane cyclases and demonstrates the potential of engineering variants for selective product formation.








Abstract
Eunicellane diterpenoids, with over 360 known examples characterized by a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;6/10&#8208;bicyclic carbon skeleton, exhibit diverse biological activities. To date, five eunicellane cyclases (ECs) have been reported: cis&#8208;ECs (Bnd4, CpDTS2 and EcTPS1) and trans&#8208;ECs (AlbS and MicA), yet the structural basis and molecular mechanisms governing their distinct cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;cyclization modes remain unsolved. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cis&#8208;EC AriE from Amycolatopsis arida, which catalyzes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form cis&#8208;6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene (1) in aridacin biosynthesis. Through surface entropy reduction, we obtained the 1.87 &#197; resolution structure of AriED128A. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis identified W73 as a key regulatory hotspot controlling product diversity, with its variants generating diverse diterpene products. Y203A converted AriE into a highly specific (&#8211;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;cembrene A synthase. Our findings provide the first structural insights into this type of terpene synthase and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering EC variants for selective product formation.

         <dc:description>Naphthoxy&#8208;imine pyridine zinc and magnesium complexes were synthesized and fully characterized by NMR. In the presence of an alcohol as initiator, both complexes promoted the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA), &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL), &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#946;&#8208;BL), trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and 1&#8208;methyl trimethylene carbonate (Me&#8208;TMC), which was purposely synthesized from CO2 and the appropriate diol. The zinc complex exhibited notably high activity, particularly in the polymerization of lactide and trimethylene carbonate, and was subsequently employed in the synthesis of polytrimethylene carbonate&#8208;based diblock and random copolymers with both &#949;&#8208;caprolactone and L&#8208;lactide. Furthermore, the zinc complex demonstrated its ability to close the life cycle of the synthesized materials by successfully depolymerizing both PTMC and its copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>&#414;6&#8208;Fluoranthene Complexes from the Reactions of Osmacyclopentadienes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise alkyne cyclotrimerizations were demonstrated at Os metal center. Paramagnetic osmacyclopentadiene complexes were the key intermediates and novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes of osmium were produced.








Abstract
Osmacyclopentadiene complexes were obtained from the reactions between OsCl2(PPh3)3 and 1,8&#8208;dialkynyl naphthalene compounds. These complexes exhibited paramagnetism as they adopted triplet ground states. Reactions of osmacyclopentadienes with alkynes were investigated, which produced novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes, showing their potential in organometallic synthesis.

         <title>Push and Pull: The Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electrocnic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the LUMO, shifts the reduction potential by +0.9 V and completely quenches emission via non&#8208;radiative deactivation processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776;25 nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, non&#8208;emissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (25.9 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural and electronic modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and reactivity of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next&#8208;generation photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Interesting Aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon Excited States of Cyclo[16]Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure and aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon excited states of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) have been investigated. The results show that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more pronounced in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state). Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.








Abstract
Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck&#8211;Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state. Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.&#160;These conclusions are supported by multiple robust indicators such as atomic force, induced current, and magnetic shielding, from qualitative, quantitative, and graphical perspectives.

         <title>Tailored Self&#8208;Assembled Biomimetic Nanofibers for Light&#8208;Driven &#946;&#8208;lactam Antibiotics Degradation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial biomimetic micellar system that integrates photothermal agents and ionic copper catalytic sites with spatially controlled positioning on a fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold via a crystal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly method. Tailored photothermal&#8208;assisted antibiotic degradation (PAD) nanofibers achieve efficient &#946;&#8208;lactam degradation in deionized water, offering a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.








Abstract
The overuse of antibiotics in China and the resulting rise in antibiotic resistance pose an urgent need for effective antibiotic degradation in water. Developing artificial systems that mimic the catalytic efficiency of natural photoactive enzymes for this purpose remains a critical challenge. Despite decades of research, there is a notable scarcity of precisely designed scaffolds that can replicate the structural and functional efficiency of natural enzymes for waterborne antibiotic degradation, particularly at the nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. In this study, we present a core&#8208;corona type fiber&#8208;like micellar system designed for photothermal&#8208;assisted &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic degradation (PAD) in water. This system integrates photothermal molecular chromophores (zinc porphyrin) and ionic copper degradation catalysts in close proximity within grafted solvophilic coronal chains on the surface of fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold. By employing a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) strategy, we fine&#8208;tune the composition, dimensions, and antibiotic degradation performance of the PAD nanofibers. The tailored colloidal stable PAD nanofibers achieve a penicillin G degradation rate of 0.35 min&#8722;1 per micromole of copper under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5) in deionized water, offering a promising platform for sustainable environmental remediation.

         <title>Nitro&#8208;Group &#960; System Drives the Interaction of RRx&#8208;001 with Electrons in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of cluster experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy with theory enables tracking of the chemistry induced by secondary low&#8208;energy electrons to RRx&#8208;001 in solution from the initial interaction to the final radiolysis products. The catalytic and state&#8208;selective nature of the LEE interaction is identified, with consequences for the understanding of the LEE action in radiation damage in&#160;general.








Abstract
Reactivity toward low&#8208;energy electrons (LEE) has been hypothesized as a cause of radio&#8208;modifying properties for various molecules. LEE's transient nature, however, prevents the establishment of clear links between initial processes at the sub&#8208;ps time scale and the final products of radiolysis. Here, such links are explored for the radio&#8208;modifying compound RRx&#8208;001 (1&#8208;bromoacetyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidine).
Picosecond pulse radiolysis demonstrates the high scavenging capacity of the molecule for secondary quasi&#8208;free and solvated electrons forming stable parent anions confirmed by studies of microsolvated RRx&#8208;001 in clusters. The anions decay either via auto&#8208;detachment of an electron or dissociate involving hydrogen transfer from solvent, resulting in NO2 and 1&#8208;(bromoacetyl)&#8208;3&#8208;nitroazetidine. Surprisingly, no Br dissociation is observed despite its high electron affinity. We assign this behavior to the &#8220;inaccessibility&#8221; of sigma virtual states for electrons in the solvent, which can be of a general nature.

         <title>2D MOF Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Impedance Detector for Synergistic Biofilm Detection and Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dual&#8208;functional 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for simultaneous biofilm detection and elimination. The detector achieves sensitive impedance response for biofilm monitoring and enables efficient biofilm clearance via peroxidase&#8208;like activity. This approach offers a novel strategy for improving MFCs efficiency through integrated biofilm real&#8208;time detection and elimination.








Abstract
The formation of biofilm has become a significant influencing factor to microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Developing effective biofilm detection means are highly imperative for improving the efficiency of MFCs. In this study, we propose a 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (2D Cu&#8208;BDC) nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for the simultaneous detection and removal of bacterial biofilms. The promising induction interface features good electron transfer and biofilm attachment properties, realizing sensitive biofilm detection. The impedance response change on the functionalized 2D Cu&#8208;BDC detector was 3.5 times higher for Gram&#8208;positive bacteria biofilm and 2.7 times higher for Gram&#8208;negative bacteria biofilm compared to bare electrodes. In addition, the 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme demonstrates robust peroxidase&#8208;like activity, enabling efficient biofilm degradation&#160;at low H2O2 concentration, and further allowing for real&#8208;time monitoring of the biofilm elimination process. This study provides a novel approach to using MOF&#8208;based biosensors for the simultaneous detection and removal of biofilm in MFCs.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Enabled Pathway Complexity in Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we report a unique pathway complexity in supramolecular hydrogels. We demonstrate that chemical reduction followed by oxidation creates a kinetically trapped state, which evolves into various network structures, morphologies, and macroscopic stiffness.








Abstract
Pathway complexity in supramolecular assemblies presents a unique opportunity for a single, relatively simple system to exhibit a wide range of properties allowing for multifunctionality. In this study, we report redox&#8208;enabled pathway complexity in amino acid&#8208;functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) and its consequence for the macroscopic hydrogel network. We show that chemical reduction and subsequent oxidation enable a kinetically trapped state which transforms into different network morphologies in response to heat and time. Our finding that pathway complexity in supramolecular systems can alter bulk material properties suggests the potential for future development of dynamic materials that achieve multiple macroscopic functions with a single building block.

         <title>The Role of Asparagine as a Gatekeeper Residue in the Selective Binding of Rare Earth Elements by Lanthanide&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) have been utilized as a green extractant to selectively separate rare earth elements (REEs). We reveal up from the molecular level how the N5 asparagine residue is indispensable in imparting selective complexation between lighter and heavier lanthanides by conformationally functioning as a gate. We demonstrate that for the smaller Ln3+ cations&#160;like Lu3+ the gate remains locked by an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond between N5 and E14 residues, locking the binding pocket. In contrast, for larger Ln3+ cations like La3+, the gate is open, allowing water to infiltrate inside the pocket.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT) peptides selectively complex lanthanide cations (Ln3+) in their binding pockets and are promising for lanthanide separation. However, designing LBTs that selectively target specific Ln3+ cations remains a challenge due to limited molecular&#8208;level understanding and control of interactions within the lanthanide&#8208;binding pocket. In this study, we reveal that the N5 asparagine residue acts as a gatekeeper in the binding pocket, resulting in a 100&#8208;fold selectivity for smaller Lu3+ over larger La3+ cations. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the N5 residue weakly binds to the larger La3+ cation, permitting H2O molecules inside the pocket. For the smaller Lu3+ cations, the N5 residue forms an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond with the E14 glutamic acid residue, locking the Lu3+ cation in the pocket and preventing H2O infiltration. Mutating the N5 asparagine to a D5 aspartic acid prevents such a hydrogen bond, eliminating the gatekeeping mechanism and precipitously reducing selectivity. The resulting binding affinity to Ln3+ cations is non&#8208;monotonic but generally increases with cation size. These results suggest a molecular design paradigm: the reduced affinity for larger lanthanides is due to open pocket conformations, while the selectivity of smaller Ln3+ cations over larger ones is due to the gatekeeping hydrogen bond.

         <title>Dinitrogen Splitting without Barrier or Visible Light&#8208;Driven: Reactions of Vanadium Trimers and Dimers with Dinitrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Striking differences between the reactivity of vanadium atoms, dimers, and trimer clusters were revealed by matrix isolation experiments. Vanadium atoms only form weakly bound N2 complexes, but the V3 cluster splits the NN triple bond to give a V3N2 cluster. The V2 dimer requires visible light irradiation to form two isomeric V2N2 clusters with and without V&#9472;V bond. The results demonstrate the potential of clusters for N2 conversion.








Abstract
The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers toward dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V2 and V3 react by cleavage of the N2 triple bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V3 reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix deposition, the reaction of V2 requires activation by irradiation with visible light. There is evidence for two isomers of V2N2, a planar one with a 5Au electronic term and a long V&#9472;V distance, and a folded one with a 1A1 term and a short V&#9472;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V2 and V3 with N2 that contain activated N2 units.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue TADF Emission from Multiheteroatom&#8208;doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Embedded with Dual B&#8208;O Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in the development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#8208;O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom&#8208;doped molecule, BNB&#8208;OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free methodology, achieving an impressive one&#8208;pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB&#8208;OPTZ adopts a symmetric distorted semi&#8208;planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long&#8208;range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B&#8208;O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom&#8208;doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH&#8208;based blue&#8208;light OLED applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Access of Heterocycles Utilizing Inherent Carbodicationic Reactivity of Ynone via Lewis Acid Catalysed C&#9472;C Triple Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient silver&#8208;catalysed triple cascade reaction has been developed to afford easy access to quinazolinone, quinazoline, and benzazole utilizing the gem&#8208;carbodicationic character of ynone. This triple cascade reaction involves sequential conjugate addition followed by Grob&#8208;type fragmentation assisted by stereoelectronic effect. Complex heterocycles have been synthesised by combining this triple cascade reaction followed by a cross&#8208;coupling reaction in the same synthetic sequence.








Abstract
Divalent carbodicationic synthon has attracted significant attention due to its unique reactivity and bonding. The application of this synthon in synthetic settings is still fancy owing to its super&#8208;electrophilicity. Generation of this reactive intermediate in a catalytic fashion is challenging. For the first time, the reactivity of the chemical equivalent of divalent dication synthon has been proposed via Lewis acid&#8208;catalysed heterolytic ionisation of ynone via sequential conjugate addition to ynone followed by C&#9472;C bond cleavage to afford heteroarenes. A library of quinazolinones and 2&#8208;substituted quinazolinones has been synthesised with good to excellent yields having a wide range of functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope using 2&#8208;amino benzamides as a nucleophilic partner. Furthermore, 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes afforded the corresponding benzimidazole in synthetically good yield. The generality of this strategy has been demonstrated by the successful synthesis of 6&#8208;mono and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;substituted quinazolinones and 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted quinazoline with very high efficiency. The mechanistic study confirmed the role of the cooperative effect and secondary orbital interaction in Grob&#8208;type fragmentation and not the involvement of any radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>The Role of Ion Size and &#960;&#8208;Interaction in Stabilizing Calix[4]arene Crown Ether Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study systematically investigates the influence of ion size on the structure and stability of complexes formed between the calix[4]arene crown ether 1,3&#8208;alt&#8208;25,27&#8208;bis(3,7&#8208; dimethyloctyl&#8208;1&#8208;oxy)calix[4]arenebenzocrown&#8208;6 (MAXCalix) and mono&#8208; and divalent ions from the alkali and alkaline earth metal series. NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand&#8217;s versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. Additionally, &#960;&#8208;interactions between the cation and the cation&#8208;facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from &#960;&#8208;interactions with both cation&#8208;facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These &#960;&#8208;interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cis&#8208;Chelating Diphosphanes for Intra&#8208;Cavity Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes derived from cyclodextrins (CDs), each with various intra&#8208;cavity environments, compel NiII or PdII metal centers to reside within &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;CD cavities. Nickel(II) complexes of these metal&#8208;confining ligands act as active catalysts in ethylene oligomerization upon activation with modified methyaluminoxane (MMAO). The size of the cavity and the position of the P2Ni fragment relative to the cavity affect both the activity and selectivity of the reaction. In all instances, 1&#8208;butene is the major product (up to 98% C4 products and 90% 1&#8208;butene within the C4 fraction). Extensive theoretical studies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods carried out on the most selective system suggest that the CD cavity restricts isomerization pathways by limiting the mobility of the coordinated olefin in this constrained supramolecular environment, thereby enhancing &#945;&#8208;olefin formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Four&#8208;Coordinate O^N^O Boron Complexes: Synthesis, Photophysical and Theoretical Studies, and TADF&#8208;Based OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the synthesis, along with the full photophysical and computational characterization, of a series of push&#8208;pull boron complexes comprising a sterically&#8208;hindered donor connected to a pyrimidine&#8208;based O^N^O boron chelate. The dimethylacridan&#8208;functionalized fluorophore appears to be the most emissive in the series, both in toluene solution and in the solid state (as a powder), displaying TADF emission in degassed media due to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This result is in line with a previously reported pyridine analogue, which also exhibits delayed emission. Incorporation of this TADF compound into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led to the observation of intense electroluminescence, with EQEmax values reaching 9.7%, at a 5 wt% doping concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage Engineering of Triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine&#8208;based COFs, yielding TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF (with C=C linkage) and TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF (with a C=N linkage), respectively. TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits better thermal stability and a higher surface area than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF. More importantly, the C=C linkage in TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C=N linkage in TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and &#960;&#8208;delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Deferoxamine Complexes of Cu(II) and Zr(IV): Insights in the Development of Dual Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deferoxamine (DFO) is widely regarded as benchmark chelator for 89Zr(IV), a commonly used PET (Positron Emission Tomography) tracer. We have introduced a novel fluorescent coumarin derivative of DFO (DFOKC), characterized by chelating unit and fluorophore covalently linked via a lysine molecule. This design introduces a free primary amine group, which, in perspective, can be functionalized with biological vectors, potentially improving tumour tissue selectivity. Its acid&#8208;base and metal coordination properties toward Cu(II) and Zr(IV) ions were thoroughly characterized using UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. DFOKC strongly coordinates both metal ions, forming somewhat more stable complexes than DFO, while retaining fluorescence emission, thus enabling dual&#8208;mode optical and PET imaging. Biodistribution assays conducted on NIH&#8208;3T3 fibroblasts, and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated that the presence of primary amine groups favours Zr&#8208;DFOKC complex cell internalization via pinocytosis compared to the parent molecule DFOC, in which the fluorophore is linked to the amine group of DFO. Furthermore, crystal violet and MTT assays revealed no cytotoxic effects or mitochondrial impairment, even at concentrations higher than those typically used for radiodiagnostic applications. These results strongly support the potential of DFOKC as a versatile and promising tool for dual imaging, offering significant advantages in molecular imaging.</dc:description>

Its acid-base and metal coordination properties toward Cu(II) and Zr(IV) ions were thoroughly characterized using UV-Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. DFOKC strongly coordinates both metal ions, forming somewhat more stable complexes than DFO, while retaining fluorescence emission, thus enabling dual-mode optical and PET imaging. Biodistribution assays conducted on NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated that the presence of primary amine groups favours Zr-DFOKC complex cell internalization via pinocytosis compared to the parent molecule DFOC, in which the fluorophore is linked to the amine group of DFO. Furthermore, crystal violet and MTT assays revealed no cytotoxic effects or mitochondrial impairment, even at concentrations higher than those typically used for radiodiagnostic applications. These results strongly support the potential of DFOKC as a versatile and promising tool for dual imaging, offering significant advantages in molecular imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling New Triazoloquinoxaline&#8208;based PROTACs Designed for the Selective Degradation of the ncBAF Chromatin Remodeling Subunit BRD9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain&#8208;containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family&#8208;related targets, e.g., BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non&#8208;BET proteins have been reported so far. Among them, BRD9 has been recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycans and Chirality: Stereoselectivity at the Core of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8217;s Recognition. A Novel View of the Optimum Minimal Ligand Epitope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror&#8208;image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin&#8211;glycan recognition, using the well&#8208;characterized human C&#8208;type lectin DC&#8208;SIGN as a model. By combining experimental (STD&#8208;NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC&#8208;SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2+&#8208;coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L&#8208;fucose and D&#8208;mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC&#8208;SIGN also binds &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose, and myo&#8208;inositol. Among these, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;D&#8208;mannose, while &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose binds more strongly than D&#8208;rhamnose and myo&#8208;inositol, albeit with lower affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;L&#8208;fucose. STD&#8208;NMR experiments confirmed that all these ligands share the same core binding epitope.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Deep&#8208;Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Iridium Complex for Plant Cell Wall Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant cell wall imaging has received consistent attention in characterizing and monitoring the structure and health of plant tissues. To overcome current drawbacks of plant cell wall staining, such as source limitations, low specificity, auto&#8208;fluorescence interference, in this work we present the rational design of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex as a specific staining agent of plant cell wall. Cell wall probe [Ir(dpyb)2(iqbtz)]+ (Ir&#8208;CW), bearing two rotatable pyridyl moieties, is designed to selective binding to pectin, one of the major components of the cell wall that carries rich carboxylic residues on its polymer chain. The AIE properties, pectin sensing behaviors, pectin binding mechanism and practical application of cell wall staining of Ir&#8208;CW are performed. Results demonstrate that Ir&#8208;CW exhibit pectin&#8208;responsive AIE properties and selective pectin binding against common interfering species including metal ions, anions, amino acids and saccharides. Notably, Ir&#8208;CW can specifically stain plant cell walls with better performance than Congo red, a commercial cell wall staining agent. This work highlights the rationales of developing novel iridium complexes for cell wall staining, and widely broadening their applications as powerful tools for botanical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Azoarenes to N&#8208;Alkylated Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge is likely to arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen&#8217;s in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we have developed a new and efficient method for constructing N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diarylhydrazines by arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed an one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde and Hantzsch ester. The use of mild reaction conditions offers to provide tri&#8208;substituted hydrazine derivatives and suppress the N&#8208;N cleaved product amines and/or imines. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide variety of hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Method has been successfully utilized in the late&#8208;stage functionalization, diversification of pharmaceuticals. The mechanistic study demonstrates the unique behaviour of boron&#8208;based catalysts as both Lewis acids and hydrogen&#8208;bond donors. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that iminium formation step is likely to be the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dugganite Structure as a Host for New Colored Compounds and for Oxygen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family compounds with the general formula A3BC3D2O14 (A = Pb, Ba, Sr; B = Te, Sb; C = Al, Ga, Fe, Zn; D = P, V, As, Si, Ge) stabilised in the dugganite structure has been prepared and characterized. The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d&#8208;d transitions and possible metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared ( NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV &#8208; cut off (85&#8208;90%), which indicates possible use as UV&#8208;NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3&#8211; 5 times higher than KDP. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long &#8211; term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Structural Design of Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals Based on&#160;Linear Tris&#8208;Pyrrolidinium Salt</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter&#8208;anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (11&#8208;PF6) exhibited two solid&#8208;solid phase transitions, and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 210 &#176;C. Similarly, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (12&#8208;PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &#916;Sfof 18 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 206 &#176;C. The temperature&#8208;dependent soft crystalline phases of 11&#8208;PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11&#8208;PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#215;10&#8208;6 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 at 70 &#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#215;10&#8208;4 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11&#8208;PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4 V (vs. Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;voltage electrolyte component.</dc:description>

In this study, a series of linear tris-pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter-anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N-bis(4-(N&#8217;-undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris-hexafluorophosphate (11-PF6) exhibited two solid-solid phase transitions, and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13 J&#8729;K-1&#8729;mol-1 at 210 &#176;C.

         <title>Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulation of pH Effects on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Structure, Dynamics and Metal&#8208;Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of pH on the structure, dynamics and metal&#8208;binding ability of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, the peptide implicated in onset of Alzheimer's disease. We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect size, flexibility and secondary structure of the peptide. Binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946;.</dc:description>
