      <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical properties of aromatic hydrocarbons having one and two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  . The mono&#8208; (  1  ) and di&#8208;boryl compounds (  2  ) readily prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction are fairly stable to air and moisture in the solid&#8208;state. The inserted ethynediyl (C &#8801;C) spacer cancels steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective&#160; &#960; &#8208;conjugation over the B &#8208; C &#8801; C &#8208;Ar linkages as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. Despite the small structural differences, photophysical properties of the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives were different. Virtually no emission was observed for the benzene derivatives, whereas the anthracene derivatives emitted with high quantum yields both in solution and solid states. Notably, the naphthalene derivatives showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Unlike common sterically congested triarylborane derivatives reported so far, the anthracene derivatives showed&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; * type absorption and emission bands, which derived from the efficient intramolecular orbital interactions between the boron centers and the anthracene moieties as supported by the density functional calculations. As a result, the dimesitylborylethynyl substituents effectively lowers the LUMO levels of the aromatic hydrocarbon parts while the HOMO levels are almost unaffected, leading to materials with controllable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of a pyrimidine&#8208;dione derivative with potent inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase</title>
      <dc:description>New drugs aimed at novel targets are urgently needed to combat the increasing rate of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). Here, the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI&#8208;DTP) chemical library was screened against a promising new target, ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway. From this library, 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylthiazolo[4,5&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine&#8208;5,7(4  H  ,6  H  )&#8208;dione (NSC116565) was identified as a potent time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (  Mt  ) KARI with a K  i  of 95.4 nM. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies showed that this inhibitor binds to Mt KARI in the presence and absence of the co&#8208;factor, NADPH, which was confirmed by crystal structures of the compound in complex with the closely related Staphylococcus aureus (  Sa  ) KARI. We have also shown that NSC116565 inhibits the growth of H37Ra and H37Rv strains of Mt with MIC  50  values of 2.93 &#181;M and 6.06 &#181;M, respectively. These results further validate KARI as a TB drug target and show that NSC116565 is a promising lead for anti&#8208;TB drug development.</dc:description>

      <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we developed a quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20 &#176;C. Analysis with the linear&#8208;free energy relationship lg  K  B  =  LA  B  +  LB  B  allows to calculate equilibrium constants  K  B  for any type of borane/Lewis base combination by the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (  LA  B  ) and one for Lewis basicity (  LB  B  ). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid toward various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. We demonstrate that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8208;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;  H  BF3  ). Furthermore, we show that this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Aldosterone Glucuronide, an Important Biomarker: Synthesis and Structure Elucidation of Novel Isomers</title>
      <dc:description>
A biomarker: (18R)&#8208;Aldosterone&#8208;18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucuronide (1) is an important biological marker. A new synthesis is described starting from aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate and the trichloroacetimidate of 2,3,4&#8208;triacetylglucuronic acid methyl ester in the presence of TMSOTf, which is followed by two enzymatic steps. In this process also the novel C&#8208;20&#8208;glucuronides (2) are obtained. The so far unknown stereochemistry at C&#8208;18 in (1) was determined by NOESY experiments.







Abstract
Aldosterone 1 is a mineralocorticoid, it has great influence on the blood pressure and its glucuronide is an important marker for the detection of several diseases. Here, we describe the chemical synthesis of different aldosterone&#8208;18&#8208; and 20&#8208;glucuronides. Reaction of trimethylsilyl 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208; acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronic acid methyl ester 5&#8201;b and aldosterone diacetate 11 in the presence of TMSOTf gave the 18&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucuronide 9&#8201;a. The 18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide 15&#8201;b and the 20&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide 16&#8201;b could be obtained by reaction of methyl 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;isobutyryl&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;glucuronate trichloroacetimidate 14 and aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate 8 in the presence of TMSOTf or BF3&#8901;OEt2. Finally, reaction of aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate 8 and methyl 2,3,4&#8208;triacetyl&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;glucuronate trichloroacetimidate 19 in the presence of TMSOTf gave the corresponding methyl 18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;triacetylglucuronate 9&#8201;b, which was transformed into the desired aldosterone&#8208;18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide 3 by two enzyma&#8208; tic transformations.

Reaction of trimethylsilyl 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208; acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronic acid methyl ester &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; and aldosterone diacetate &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of TMSOTf gave the 18&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucuronide &lt;b&gt;9&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;. The 18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide &lt;b&gt;15&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; and the 20&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide &lt;b&gt;16&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; could be obtained by reaction of methyl 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;isobutyryl&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;glucuronate trichloroacetimidate &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt; and aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of TMSOTf or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, reaction of aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and methyl 2,3,4&#8208;triacetyl&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;glucuronate trichloroacetimidate &lt;b&gt;19&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of TMSOTf gave the corresponding methyl 18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;triacetylglucuronate &lt;b&gt;9&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, which was transformed into the desired aldosterone&#8208;18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; by two enzyma&#8208; tic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synergistic Effect of Simultaneous Doping of Ceria Nanorods with Cu and Cr on CO Oxidation and NO Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Ceria particles play a key role in catalytic applications such as automotive three&#8208;way catalytic systems in which toxic CO and NO are oxidized and reduced to safe CO  2  and N  2  , respectively. In this work, we explore the incorporation of Cu and Cr metals as dopants in the crystal structure of ceria nanorods prepared by a single step hydrothermal synthesis. XRD, Raman and XPS confirm the incorporation of Cu and Cr in the ceria crystal lattices, offering ceria nanorods with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies. XPS also confirms the presence of Cr and Cu surface species. H  2  &#8208;TPR and XPS analysis show that the simultaneous Cu and Cr co&#8208;doping results in a catalyst with a higher surface Cu concentration and a much&#8208;enhanced surface reducibility, in comparison with either undoped or singly doped (Cu or Cr) ceria nanorods. While single Cu doping enhances catalytic CO oxidation and Cr doping improves catalytic NO reduction, co&#8208;doping with both Cu and Cr enhances the benefits of both dopants in a synergistic manner employing roughly a quarter of dopant weight.</dc:description>

      <title>How does bridging core modification alter the photovoltaic characteristics of triphenylamine&#8208;based hole transport materials? Theoretical understanding and prediction</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest of researchers owing to their high photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCE), and long length diffusion of hole and electron in perovskite solar cells.

In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of recently synthesized H&#8208;Bi molecule (  R  ) is done with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (  HB1&#8208;HB10  ) having D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D backbone have been obtained. Structural&#8208;property relationship, optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of newly designed hole transport materials are comprehensively examined and compared with reference molecule. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with assist of density functional theory and time dependent&#8208;density functional theory. All designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (E  g  =2.82&#8208;2.99 eV) as compared to R molecule (E  g  =3.05 eV). Designed molecules expressed red&#8208;shifting in absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies.&#160;Results of all analysis advocate that these novel designed HTMs are ideal aspirant for construction of future high performance perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the Uniqueness of 2p Elements in Periodic Tables</title>
      <dc:description>
The 2p elements exhibit chemistries qualitatively different from their heavier congeners. The physical origin is the quantitative interplay of electronic, kinetic, and potential energies: The 2p orbital has no radial node and therefore little radial kinetic energy, thus 2p is radially rather contracted. All ns orbitals are weakly shielded from nuclear attraction in many&#8208;electronic atoms, thus all ns&#8208;orbitals are radially contracted.

The recognition of a guest Na+ ion significantly accelerated the AcO&#8722;&#8208;mediated gate&#8208;opening of a closed dicobalt(III) macrocyclic metallohost [LCo2(hda)2]2+, which has two bridging 1,6&#8208;hexanediamine (hda) ligands, yielding an open host&#8212;guest complex [LCo2(hda)2(OAc)&#8901;Na]2+.

Abstract
A large&#8208;scale synthesis of known Ru olefin metathesis catalyst VII featuring an unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand with one 2,5&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (DIPP) and one thiophenylmethylene N&#8208;substituent is reported. The optimised procedure does not require column chromatography in any step and allows for preparation of up to 0.5&#8197;kg batches of the catalyst from simple precursors. The application profile of the obtained catalyst was studied in environmentally friendly dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Although VII exhibited low efficiency in cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) with electron&#8208;deficient partners, good to excellent results were noted for substrates featuring easy to isomerise C&#8722;C double bonds. This includes polyfunctional substrates of medicinal chemistry interest, such as analogues of psychoactive 5F&#8208;PB&#8208;22 and NM&#8208;2201 and two PDE5 inhibitors&#8212;Sildenafil and Vardenafil. Finally, a larger scale ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) of a Vardenafil derivative was conducted in DMC, allowing for straightforward isolation of the expected product (23&#8197;g) in high yield and with low Ru contamination level (7.7&#8197;ppm).

Oh, now I see! The precipitates formed during ThIV hydrolysis are ThO2 nanoparticles, which in their initial stages of formation are a mixture of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles and Th hexamer clusters. This new structural insight is made possible by the combined use of two synchrotron techniques: HEXS and XANES in HERFD mode, which probe short&#8208; and medium&#8208;range order in the sample under study.

      <title>Doubling F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications to Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>Designing potential protein&#8208;ligand pair is pivotal not only to track protein structure, dynamics but also to assist in atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Here we report the potentiality of a small model thioamide probe that can be used to study albumin proteins. Monitoring F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, we observed two&#8208;fold enhancement in the FRET efficiency in the case of 2&#8208;Thiopyridone (2TPY) compared to its amide analog. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation depicts the relative position of the free energy minima to be quite stable in case of 2TPY via non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur which helps for enhancement in the FRET efficiency. Finally, we showed its application by pairing thiouracils with protein. We found that site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency which can be a potential avenue to explore for designing FRET probes to study structure and dynamics of biomolecules.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD) is one of the most common multifactorial diseases characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. Herein, we investigate the effect of Cu(II) ions on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;40, and A&#946;4&#8208;40, representing two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, full length and N&#8208;truncated ones. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains. In either of the studied peptides, substoichiometric Cu(II) concentrations accelerated aggregation, while superstoichiometric Cu(II) inhibited the fibril formation, likely by stabilizing oligomers. The addition of either A&#946;4&#8208;40 or substoichiometric Cu(II) ions affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8208;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase of positive charge at the A&#946; N&#8208;terminus, which is caused either by Cu(II) complexation or N&#8208;truncation at position 4. Our findings provide a better understanding of the biological A&#946; aggregation process as these two A&#946; species and Cu(II) ions coexist and interact under physiological conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemodivergence Between Electrophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>In Vitro and In Vivo Sequestration of Phencyclidine by Me4Cucurbit[8]uril</title>
      <dc:description>We report investigations of the use of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) macrocycles as an

antidote to counteract the in vivo biological effects of phencyclidine. We investigate the binding

of CB[8] and its derivative Me4CB[8] toward ten drugs of abuse (3 &#8211; 9, 12 &#8211;14) by a combination

of 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry in phosphate buffered water. We

find that the cavity of CB[8] and Me4CB[8] are able to encapsulate the 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclohexane

ring system of phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine as well as the morphinan skeleton

of morphine and hydromorphone with Kd values &#8804; 50 nM. In vitro cytotoxicity (MTS metabolic

and adenylate kinase cell death assays in HEK293 and HEPG2 cells) and in vivo maximum

tolerated dose studies (Swiss Webster mice) which were performed for Me4CB[8] indicated good

tolerability. The tightest host&#8226;guest pair (Me4CB[8]&#8226;PCP; Kd = 2 nM) was advanced to in vivo

efficacy studies. The results of open field tests demonstrate that pretreatment of mice with

Me4CB[8] prevents subsequent hyperlocomotion induction by PCP and also that treatment of

animals previously dosed with PCP with Me4CB[8] significantly reduces the locomotion levels.</dc:description>

      <title>Inversion symmetry breaking in order&#8211;disorder transitions of globular ligands coordinating to cobalt(II) and nickel(II) bisacetylacetonato complexes during heating</title>
      <dc:description>Unexpected inversion&#8208;symmetry breaking was observed in the order&#8211;disorder phase transitions of [M(acac)  2  (abco)  2  ] (  1  ; M = Co  2+  ,  2  ; Ni  2+  , acac  &#8722;  = 2,4&#8208;pentanedionato, abco = 1&#8208;azabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]&#8208;octane = quinuclidine) during heating.

Complexes  1  and  2  crystallized in ordered phases in the centrosymmetric  I  2/  m  space group at 100 K, whereas they crystallized in disordered phases in the non&#8208;symmetric  I  2 space group at 300 K. The 60&#176; step rotation disordering of the abco ligands was observed in the electron density maps of  1  and  2  , which was consistent with the transition enthalpies estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Gradual phase transitions were observed for  1  and  2  by DSC and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) at approximately 225 K. The inversion&#8208;symmetry disordering was likely induced by the local pseudo&#8208;symmetry of the abco ligands, increasing from trigonal to hexagonal and the increased steric repulsion pathways among them.</dc:description>

The 60&#176; step rotation disordering of the abco ligands was observed in the electron density maps of  1  and  2  , which was consistent with the transition enthalpies estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Gradual phase transitions were observed for  1  and  2  by DSC and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) at approximately 225 K. The inversion&#8208;symmetry disordering was likely induced by the local pseudo&#8208;symmetry of the abco ligands, increasing from trigonal to hexagonal and the increased steric repulsion pathways among them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Size&#8208;Controlled Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanosphere Supported Ultrafine Ru Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation of Quinolines</title>
      <dc:description>
Soft templating: Nitrogen&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanosphere (NMCS) with tunable sizes and uniform mesoporosity is synthesized by a facile soft&#8208;templating method, whereby F127 (PEO&#8211;PPO&#8211;PEO triblock copolymer) can be used not only as a soft template to generate the mesostructure but also as a size&#8208;control agent to tailor the size of NMCS ranging from 100 to 700&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanosphere (NMCS) with tunable sizes and uniform mesoporosity was synthesized by a facile soft&#8208;templating method. During the synthesis, F127 (PEO&#8211;PPO&#8211;PEO triblock copolymer) could be used not only as a soft template to generate the mesostructure but also as a size&#8208;control agent to tailor the size of NMCS in a relatively wide range of 100 to 700&#8197;nm. In addition, the synthesis process was simple and suitable for large&#8208;scale production. Moreover, the NMCS was used as support of ultrafine Ru nanoparticles (Ru/NMCS), which exhibited good catalytic performances for selective hydrogenation of quinolones. It is expected that the simple synthetic strategy for the NMCS can generate extensive interest in many catalysis and sorption applications.

The Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) was employed as a new reaction in kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS). Applying the reaction on the bacterial &#946; sliding clamp (DnaN) (middle) resulted in marked acceleration of product assembly from a library of eight building blocks representing four chemical classes.

      <title>Aromatic Aza&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement of Arylpropargylammonium Salts Generated in Situ from Arynes and Tertiary Propargylamines</title>
      <dc:description>The charge&#8208;accelerated aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of ammonium salts serves as a key step in the construction of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. In contrast to the aliphatic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, much less attention has been paid to the aromatic one. Herein, we report an unprecedented aromatic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of arylpropargylammonium salts, generated in situ from arynes and tertiary propargylamines, delivering structurally diverse 2&#8208;propargylanilines in moderate to good yields with high regioselectivity. This rearrangement proceeds in the absence of strong bases and transition metals, is compatible with moisture and air, tolerates a wide variety of functional groups, and is amenable to form eleven&#8208; to thirteen&#8208;membered heterocycles embedded with a triple bond. The 2&#8208;propargylaniline products were treated with aluminum chloride in ethanol to afford multisubstituted indoles in moderate to excellent yields. Moreover, a series of deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>A xanthene&#8208;based mono&#8208;anionic PON ligand: exploiting a bulky, electronically unsymmetrical donor in Main Group chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a novel mono&#8208;anionic phosphino&#8208;amide ligand based on a xanthene backbone is reported, together with the corresponding Ga(I) complex, (PON)Ga (PON = 4&#8208;(di(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)phosphino)&#8208;5&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;  tert&#8208;  butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene). The solid&#8208;state structure of (PON)Ga (obtained from X&#8208;ray crystallography) reveals very weak O&#183;&#183;&#183;Ga and P&#183;&#183;&#183;Ga interactions, consistent with a R  2  NGa fragment that closely resembles those found in one&#8208;coordinate amidogallium systems. Strong N&#8208;to&#8208;Ga &#960; donation from the amido substituent is reflected in a very short N&#8208;Ga distance (1.976(4) &#197;), while the P&#183;&#183;&#183;Ga contact (3.078(2) &#197;) is well outside the sum of the respective covalent radii. While the donor properties of the PON ligand towards Ga(I) are highly unsymmetrical, oxidation to Ga(III) leads to much stronger coordination of the pendant phosphine as shown by P&#8208;Ga distances which are up to 20% shorter. From a steric perspective, the PON ligand is shown to be significantly bulkier than related &#946;&#8208;diketiminate systems, a finding consistent with reactions of (PON)Ga towards O&#8208;atom sources that proceed without oligomerization. Despite this, the enhanced P&#8208;donor properties brought about by oxidation at gallium are not sufficient to quench the reactivity of the highly polar Ga&#8208;O unit. Instead, intramolecular benzylic C&#8208;H activation is observed across the Ga&#8208;O bond of a transient gallanone intermediate.</dc:description>

      <title>A Two&#8208;Armed Probe for In&#8208;Cell DEER Measurements on Proteins**
</title>
      <dc:description>
Two armed and ready! A two armed, thus rigid, GdIII&#8208;CLaNP13 probe for double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on proteins can be used to measure nanometer distances in cells with high precision.







Abstract
The application of double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) with site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL) to measure distances in proteins and protein complexes in living cells puts rigorous restraints on the spin&#8208;label. The linkage and paramagnetic centers need to resist the reducing conditions of the cell. Rigid attachment of the probe to the protein improves precision of the measured distances. Here, three two&#8208;armed GdIII complexes, GdIII&#8208;CLaNP13a/b/c were synthesized. Rather than the disulfide linkage of most other CLaNP molecules, a thioether linkage was used to avoid reductive dissociation of the linker. The doubly GdIII labeled N55C/V57C/K147C/T151C variants of T4Lysozyme were measured by 95&#8197;GHz DEER. The constructs were measured in vitro, in cell lysate and in Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Measured distances were 4.5&#8197;nm, consistent with results from paramagnetic NMR. A narrow distance distribution and typical modulation depth, also in cell, indicate complete and durable labeling and probe rigidity due to the dual attachment sites.

      <title>A Stable Primary Phosphane Oxide and Its Heavier Congeners</title>
      <dc:description>
Isolable primary phosphane oxides RP(O)H2 have remained elusive, unlike their secondary counterparts R2P(O)H, which have been used in various applications. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of (ferrocenylmethyl)phosphane oxide as the first bench&#8208;stable primary phosphane oxide. The preparation of the corresponding phosphane sulfide and selenide are also reported. More information can be found in the Communication by P. &#352;t&#283;pni&#269;ka et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isolable primary phosphane oxides RP(O)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; have remained elusive, unlike their secondary counterparts R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O)H, which have been used in various applications. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of (ferrocenylmethyl)phosphane oxide as the first bench&#8208;stable primary phosphane oxide. The preparation of the corresponding phosphane sulfide and selenide are also reported. More information can be found in the Communication by P. &#352;t&#283;pni&#269;ka et&#8197;al.

Study on luminescent properties of  1  and  2  reveals that the quantum yield of  1  itself basically keeps unchanged in  2  . Significantly, the formation of  2  can not only effectively prevent the cluster  1  from aggregation, but also greatly enhance its solubility and adhesion to the substrate.

      <title>Light&#8208;Driven Syngas Production over Defective ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic syngas (CO and H2) production with CO2 as gas source not only ameliorates greenhouse effect, but also produces valuable chemical feedstocks. However, traditional photocatalytic system requires noble metal or suffers from low yield. Here, we demonstrate that S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets are an ideal photocatalyst to drive CO2 reduction into syngas. It is found that building S vacancies can endow ZnIn2S4 with stronger photoabsorption, efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, and larger CO2 adsorption, finally promoting both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The syngas yield of CO and H2 is therefore significantly increased. In contrast to pristine ZnIn2S4, the syngas yield over VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can be improved by roughly ~4.73 times and the CO/H2 ratio is modified from 1:4.18 to 1:1. Total amount of syngas after 12 h photocatalysis is as high as 63.20 mmol g&#8211;1 without use of any noble metals, which is even higher than those of traditional noble metal based catalysts in the reported literatures. This work demonstrates the critical role of S vacancies in mediating catalytic activity and selectivity, and highlights the attractive ability of defective ZnIn2S4 for light&#8208;driven syngas production.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have at least a three&#8208;century long history in coordination chemistry. Recently, cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been acknowledged as efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts.

Here, in this review, the work on cobalt&#8208;based PBAs is presented in four sections: i) electrocatalytic water oxidation with bare PBAs, ii) photocatalytic process in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), iii) photoelectrochemical water oxidation by coupling PBAs to proper semiconductors (SCs), and iv) the utilization of PBA&#8208;PS assemblies coated on SCs for the dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This review will guide readers on the structure &amp; catalytic activity relationship in cobalt&#8208;based PBAs by describing the role of each structural component.

      <title>Polymerization&#8208;driven photoluminescence in alkanolamine&#8208;based C&#8208;dots</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of Carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of CPD strong photoluminescence resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms. To understand the correlation between CPD processing and properties, we have studied the early stage formation of carbonized polymer dots. In the synthesis, citric acid monohydrate and  2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol  have been thermally degraded at 180&#176;C. The use of an oil bath instead of a more traditional hydrothermal reactor has allowed to monitor the CPD properties at different reactions times. Transmission electron microscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the formation of polymeric species with amide and ester bonds. Quantum chemistry calculations has been employed to investigate the origin of CPD electronic transitions. At short reaction times, amorphous C&#8208;dots with 80% quantum yield, have been obtained.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of Carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of CPD strong photoluminescence resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms. To understand the correlation between CPD processing and properties, we have studied the early stage formation of carbonized polymer dots. In the synthesis, citric acid monohydrate and  2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol  have been thermally degraded at 180&#176;C. The use of an oil bath instead of a more traditional hydrothermal reactor has allowed to monitor the CPD properties at different reactions times. Transmission electron microscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the formation of polymeric species with amide and ester bonds. Quantum chemistry calculations has been employed to investigate the origin of CPD electronic transitions. At short reaction times, amorphous C&#8208;dots with 80% quantum yield, have been obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Impact of Heteroatom Substitution on Dual&#8208;State Emissive Rigidified 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole Dyes: Towards Ultra&#8208;Bright ESIPT Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;medium fluorophores which show significant luminescence intensity in solution and in the solid&#8208;state from two emissive forms remain scarce in the literature and can only result from a subtle balance between rigidity, planarity and solubility while avoiding detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and strong molecular motions. 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole (HBX) fluorophores are popular Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) emitters largely studied for their synthetic versatility, photostability, strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence and ability to engineer dual emission paving the way to applications as white emitters, ratiometric sensors, and cryptographic dyes. They are, however heavily quenched in solution, due to efficient non&#8208;radiative pathways taking place as a consequence of the proton transfer in the excited&#8208;state. A mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalization of the HBX scaffold with ethynyl&#8208;extended moieties was previously shown to yield enhanced brightness of the resulting dyes in solution. In this contribution, the nature of the heteroring constitutive of these rigidified HBX dyes was modified and we demonstrate that this simple structural modification triggers major optical changes in terms of emission color, dual emission engineering, and importantly, fluorescent quantum yield. Investigation of the photophysical properties in solution and in the solid&#8208;state of a series of ethynyl&#8208;TIPS extended HBX fluorophores, along with  ab initio  calculations demonstrate the very promising abilities of these dyes to act as bright dual&#8208;state emitters, in both solution and solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

      <title>Design approach of lifetime extending thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizers for highly efficient fluorescence devices</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a design approach of three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to extend the device lifetime of the TADF sensitized fluorescent devices was studied. Three TADF materials, 5&#8208;(4,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;(10,15&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,15&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;diindolo[3,2&#8208;a:3',2'&#8208;c]carbazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)benzonitrile (tTCNTruX), 4&#8208;(3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;(10,15&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,15&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;diindolo[3,2&#8208;a:3',2'&#8208;c]carbazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diphenylpyrimidine&#8208;5&#8208;carbonitrile (PCNTruX) and 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(10,15&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;10,15&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5H&#8208;diindolo[3,2&#8208;a:3',2'&#8208;c]carbazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diphenylpyrimidine&#8208;5&#8208;carbonitrile (PCNtTruX), were synthesized as the sensitizers of the TADF sensitized fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. The two tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX TADF emitters were designed to have Dexter energy transfer managing blocking groups either in the donor or acceptor unit of the donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF sensitizer. The TADF materials showed small singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting and high reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate for effective sensitization of the fluorescent emission of the fluorescent emitter. The tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitized fluorescent devices showed maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17.7% and 11.5% in the yellow and red devices, respectively, which were higher than those of the TADF sensitized devices with the corresponding TADF sensitizer without the blocking group. Moreover, the device lifetime was also extended by employing the tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitizers.</dc:description>

      <title>CompassR yields highly organic solvent&#8208;tolerant enzymes through recombination of compatible substitutions</title>
      <dc:description>The CompassR rule enables to identify among beneficial substitutions the ones, which can beneficially be recombined in directed evolution. Herein, a recombination strategy is systematically investigated to minimize experimental efforts and maximize possible improvements. In total, 15 beneficial substitutions from  Bacillus subtilis  lipase A (BSLA), which improve organic cosolvent 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DOX) resistance, were studied to compare two recombination strategies 2GenReP and InSiReP employing CompassR. Remarkably, both strategies yielded a highly DOX resistant variant M4 (I12R/Y49R/E65H/N98R/K122E/L124K) with an up to 14.6&#8208;fold improvement after screening of ~270 clones. M4 has a remarkable enhanced resistance in 60% (v/v) acetone (6.0&#8208;fold), 30% (v/v) ethanol (2.1&#8208;fold), and 60% (v/v) methanol (2.4&#8208;fold) compared to BSLA wild type. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that attracting water molecules by charged surface substitutions is the main driver for increasing the DOX resistance of BSLA M4. Both strategies and obtained molecular knowledge can likely be used to improve the properties of other enzymes with a similar &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase fold.</dc:description>

      <title>The photosensitizing efficacy of micelles containing a porphyrinic photosensitizer and KI against resistant melanoma cells</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) appears as a promising alternative to overcome the resistance of melanoma to conventional therapies. Currently applied photosensitizers (PS) are often based on tetrapyrrolic macrocycles like porphyrins.

      <title>Unravelling structural mysteries of simple organozinc alkoxides</title>
      <dc:description>Simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are among the first known organozinc compounds, and widespread interest on their multifaced chemistry has been driven by fundamental significance and potential applications including various catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, their chemistry in solution and in the solid state remains both relatively poorly understood and a subject to continuous debate. Herein, we describe the synthesis and structural characterization of long&#8208;sought structural forms, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2], incorporating diphenylmethanolate as a model alkoxide ligand. Both novel aggregates are robust in the solid state and resistant towards mechanical force. In turn, using  1H NMR and diffusion&#8208;order spectroscopy, we demonstrate that new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are kinetically labile in the solution and readily undergo ligand scrambling, such as in the case of Schlenk equilibrium. The elucidated several elusive key structural issues, which have remained undiscovered for decades, significantly advance the chemistry of RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides and should support the rational design of zinc alkoxide&#8208;based applications.</dc:description>

      <title>[Gd(AAZTA)]&#8208; derivatives with n&#8208;alkyl acid side chains show improved properties for their application as MRI contrast agents</title>
      <dc:description>Herein the synthesis and an extensive characterization of two novel Gd(AAZTA) derivatives functionalized with short (C2  and C4  )  n  &#8208;alkyl acid function are reported. The carboxylate functionality is the site for further conjugations for the design of more specific contrast agents (CAs). Interestingly it has been found that the synthetized complexes display enhanced properties for their use as MRI contrast agents by their own. The  1H&#8208;NMR spectra of the complexes with EuIII  and YbIII  displayed a set of signals consistent with half the number of methylene protons present on each ligand. The number of resonances resulted invariant over a large range of temperature to suggest the occurrence of a fast interconversion between structural isomers. The relaxivity values (298K, 20MHz) were consistent with  q  =2 being equal to 8.8 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1  for the C2  derivative and 9.4 mM&#8208;1  s&#8208;1  for the C4  one, i.e sensibly higher than the one reported for Gd(AAZTA) (7.1 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1  ). VT&#8208;  T2  17O&#8208;NMR measurements showed, for both complexes, the presence of two populations of coordinated water molecules, one in fast and one in slow exchange with the bulk water. The analysis of the  17O NMR VT&#8208;  T2  profiles vs. temperature allowed to establish their relative molar fraction being 35% for the isomer with the fast exchanging water and 65% for the isomer with the water molecules in slower exchange. Finally,  1H NMRD profiles over an extended range of applied magnetic field strengths have been satisfactory fitted on the basis of the occurrence of the two interconverting species.</dc:description>

      <title>Urea Derivatives as Functional Molecules: Supramolecular Capsules, Supramolecular Polymers, Supramolecular Gels, Artificial Hosts, and Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Urea, which has both hydrogen bond acceptor and donor moieties, is an ideal structure for a supramolecular synthon. Various supramolecules having ureido group(s) have been widely developed. This paper summarizes recent developments of urea derivatives that exhibit various functions: i) supramolecular capsules that form discrete urea&#8208;urea intermolecular hydrogen bonds, ii) supramolecular polymers that form continuous urea&#8208;urea intermolecular hydrogen bonds, iii) supramolecular gels that form continuous urea&#8208;urea intermolecular hydrogen bonds, iv) artificial host molecules based on the molecular recognition ability of the ureido group, and v) catalytic reactions developed by utilizing the molecular recognition ability of the ureido group.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Urea, which has both hydrogen bond acceptor and donor moieties, is an ideal structure for a supramolecular synthon. Various supramolecules having ureido group(s) have been widely developed. This paper summarizes recent developments of urea derivatives that exhibit various functions: i) supramolecular capsules that form discrete urea&#8208;urea intermolecular hydrogen bonds, ii) supramolecular polymers that form continuous urea&#8208;urea intermolecular hydrogen bonds, iii) supramolecular gels that form continuous urea&#8208;urea intermolecular hydrogen bonds, iv) artificial host molecules based on the molecular recognition ability of the ureido group, and v) catalytic reactions developed by utilizing the molecular recognition ability of the ureido group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Investigation of luminescent triplet states in tetranuclear Cu(I) complexes: thermochromism and structural characterization</title>
      <dc:description>To develop new and flexible Cu(I) containing luminescent substances, we extend our previous investigations on two metal&#8208;centred species to four metal&#8208;centred complexes. These complexes could be a basis for designing new organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) relevant species. Both the synthesis and in&#8208;depth spectroscopic analysis, combined with high&#8208;level theoretical calculations are presented on a series of tetranuclear Cu(I) complexes with a halide containing Cu  4  X  4  core (X = iodide, bromide or chloride) and 2&#8209;(diphenylphosphino)pyridine bridging ligands with a methyl group in  para  (4&#8208;Me) or  ortho  (6&#8208;Me) position of the pyridine ring. The structure of the electronic ground state is characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and IR spectroscopy with the support of theoretical calculations. In contrast to the  para  system, the complexes with  ortho  &#8208;substituted bridging ligands show a remarkable and reversible temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence. Here, we combine for the first time the luminescence thermochromism with time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy. Thus, we receive experimental data on the structures of the two triplet states involved in the luminescence thermochromism. The transient IR spectra of the underlying triplet metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (  3  M/XLCT) and cluster&#8208;centred (  3  CC) states were obtained and interpreted by comparison with calculated vibrational spectra. The systematic and significant dependence of the bridging halides was analysed.</dc:description>

      <title>Binding motifs in the naked complexes of target amino acids with an excerpt of antitumor active biomolecule. An ion vibrational spectroscopy assay</title>
      <dc:description>The structures of proton&#8208;bound complexes of 5,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one (  1  ) and basic amino acids (AAs), namely histidine (His) and lysine (Lys) have been examined by mass spectrometry,&#160; IR ion spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. This selection of systems is founded on the fact that  1  represents a portion of Glabrescione B, a natural small molecule of promising antitumor activity, while His and Lys are protein residues lining the cavity of the alleged receptor binding site. These species are thus a model of the bioactive adduct, though obviously the isolated state of the present study bears little resemblance with the complex biological environment. Common feature of [  1  +AA+H]  +  &#160; complexes is the presence of a protonated AA bound to neutral  1  , in spite of the fact that the gas phase basicity of  1  is comparable to the one of Lys and His. The carbonyl group of  1  acts as powerful hydrogen bond acceptor. Within [  1  +AA+H]  +  &#160; the side chain substituents (imidazole group for His and terminal amino group for Lys) present comparable basic properties as the a&#8208;amino group, taking part to a cooperative H&#8208;bond network. The structural assignment, relying on the comparative analysis of the IRMPD spectrum and calculated IR spectra for the candidate geometries, derives from an examination over two frequency ranges, 900&#8208;1800 cm  &#8208;1  and 2900&#8208;3700 cm  &#8208;1  . Information gained from the latter one proved especially valuable, for example pointing to the contribution of species characterized by an unperturbed carboxylic OH&#8208; or imidazole NH&#8208;stretching mode.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the organogelating and spectroscopic properties of a C3&#8208;symmetric pyrene&#8208;based gelator through charge transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;component organogels and xerogels based on a C3&#8208;symmetric pyrene&#8208;containing gelator have been deeply characterized through a wide range of techniques. Based on the formation of charge transfer complexes, the gelation phenomenon proved to be highly dependent on the nature of the electron poor dopant. This parameter significantly influenced the corresponding gelation domains, the critical gelation concentrations of acceptor dopants, the gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition temperatures, the microstructures formed in the xerogel state and their spectroscopic properties. In particular, titrations and variable&#8208;temperature UV&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the key role of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with a remarkable correlation between the phase transition temperatures and the disappearance of the characteristic charge transfer bands.The assignment of these electronic transitions was confirmed through time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. Eventually, it was shown that the luminescent properties of these materials can be tuned with the temperature, either in intensity or emission wavelength.</dc:description>

      <title>Large&#8208;Amplitude Thermal Vibration&#8208;Coupled Valence Tautomeric Transition Observed in a Conductive One&#8208;Dimensional Rhodium&#8211;Dioxolene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The exploration of dynamic molecular crystals is a fascinating theme for materials scientists owing to their fundamental science and potential application to molecular devices. Herein, we report a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rhodium&#8211;dioxolene complex that exhibits drastic changes in properties with the phase transition. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the room&#8208;temperature (RT) phase is in a mixed&#8208;valence state, and therefore, the drastic changes originate from the mixed&#8208;valence state appearing in the RT phase. Another notable feature is that the mean square displacements of the rhodium atoms along the 1D chain dramatically increase in the RT phase, indicating a large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds. From these results, we propose a possible mechanism for the appearance of the mixed&#8208;valence state in the RT phase based on the thermal electron transfer from the 1D d&#8208;band to the semiquinonato &#960;* orbital coupled with the large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>The Unexpected Base&#8208;pairing Behavior of Cyanuric Acid in RNA and Ribose versus Cyanuric Acid Induced Helicene Assembly of Nucleic Acids: Implications for the pre&#8208;RNA Paradigm.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyanuric acid heterocycle (CA) forms supramolecular structures with adenine nucleobases/nucleosides and oligonucleotides leading to speculation that they can act as forerunners to RNA. Herein, we studied the assembly behavior of RNA containing CA and CA&#8208;ribose nucleoside. Contrary to previous reports, CA in RNA, and as the ribonucleoside, leads to destabilization of supramolecular assemblies, which led to reevaluation of the CA&#8208;adenine hexameric rosette structure. We propose an unprecedented non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helicene structure to account for the striking difference in behavior, which has implications for novel paradigms for reorganizing the structures of nucleic acids, synthesis of long helicenes, and pre&#8208;RNA world paradigms. The results caution against extrapolating the self&#8208;assembly behavior of individual heterocycles from the level of monomers to oligomers &#8211; since the base&#8208;paring properties of (non)canonical nucleobases are impacted by the type of oligomeric backbone to which they are attached.</dc:description>

      <title>Noncovalent Helicene Structure between Nucleic Acids and Cyanuric Acid</title>
      <dc:description>Cyanuric acid (CA), a triazine heterocycle, is extensively utilized for noncovalent self&#8208;assembly.

      <title>Mechanochemically triggered topology changes in expanded porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>A hitherto unexplored class of molecules for molecular force probe applications are expanded porphyrins. This work proves mechanical force to be an effective stimulus to trigger the interconversion between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topologies in [28]hexaphyrin, making these expanded porphyrins suitable to act as conformational mechanophores operating at mild ( sub 1nN) force conditions. A straightforward approach based on distance matrices is proposed for the selection of pulling scenarios that promote either the most stable H&#252;ckel topology or the three lowest lying M&#246;bius topologies. This approach is supported by means of quantum mechanochemical calculations. Force distribution analyses reveal that [28]hexaphyrin selectively allocates the external mechanical energy to molecular regions that trigger H&#252;ckel&#8208;M&#246;bius interconversions, explaining why certain pulling scenarios favor the H&#252;ckel two&#8208;sided topology and others favor M&#246;bius single&#8208;sided topologies. The meso &#8208;substitution pattern on [28]hexaphyrin determines whether the energy difference between the different topologies can be overcome by mechanical activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Partnering a three&#8208;coordinate gallium cation with a hydroborate counter&#8208;ion for the catalytic hydrosilylation of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>A novel &#946;&#8208;diketiminate stabilized gallium hydride, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H (where (DippL) = {HC(MeCDippN)2}, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl and Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl), has been synthesized and shown to undergo insertion of CO2&#160;into the Ga&#8208;H bond under mild conditions. In this case, treatment of the resulting &#954;1&#8208;formate complex with Et3SiH does not lead to regeneration of the hydride precursor. However, when combined with B(C6F5)3, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H catalyses the reductive hydrosilylation of CO2&#160;. Under stoichiometric conditions, the addition of one equivalent of B(C6F5)3&#160;to (DippL)Ga(Ad)H leads to the formation of a 3&#8208;coordinate cationic gallane complex, partnered with a hydroborate anion, [(DippL)Ga(Ad)][HB(C6F5)3]. This complex rapidly hydrometallates carbon dioxide and catalyses the selective reduction of CO2&#160;to the formaldehyde oxidation level in the presence of Et3SiH (yielding H2C(OSiEt3)2). When catalysis is undertaken in the presence of excess B(C6F5)3, appreciable enhancement in the activity of the system is observed, with a corresponding reduction in selectivity. While this system represents proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in CO2&#160;hydrosilylation by a gallium hydride system, the TOF values obtained are relatively modest (max. 10 h&#8208;1). This is attributed to the strength of binding of the formatoborate anion to the Ga centre in the intermediate (DippL)Ga(Ad){HC(O)OB(C6F5)3}, and the correspondingly slow rate of the turnover&#8208;limiting hydrosilylation step. In turn, this strength of binding can be related to the relatively high Lewis acidity measured for the [(DippL)Ga(Ad)]+&#160;cation (AN = 69.8).</dc:description>
