         <title>Characterization of the glmS ribozymes from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  glmS  ribozyme regulates the expression of the essential GlmS enzyme being involved in cell wall biosynthesis. While &gt; 450 variants of the  glmS  ribozyme were identified by  in silico  approaches and homology searches, only a few have yet been experimentally investigated. Herein, we validate and characterize the  glmS  ribozymes of the human pathogens  Clostridium difficile  and  Listeria monocytogenes  . Both ribozymes, as their previous characterized homologs rely on glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate as co&#8208;factor and the presence of divalent cations for exerting the cleavage reaction. The observed EC  50  values in turn were found to be in the submicromolar range, at least an order of magnitude lower than observed for  glmS  ribozymes from other bacteria. The  glmS  ribozyme of  L. monocytogenes  was further shown to bear unique properties. It discriminates between co&#8208;factors very stringently and other than the  glmS  ribozyme of  C. difficile  retains activity at low temperatures. This finding illustrates that albeit being highly conserved,  glmS  ribozymes have unique characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the central role of aromaticity in the chemistry of expanded porphyrins, the evaluation of aromaticity remains difficult for these extended macrocycles. The presence of multiple conjugation pathways and different planar and nonplanar&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugation topologies makes the quantification of global and local aromaticity even more challenging. In neutral expanded porphyrins, it is established the predominance of the aromatic conjugation pathway passing through the imine&#8208;type nitrogens and circumventing the amino NH groups. However, for charged macrocycles, the question about the main conjugation circuit remains open. Accordingly, different conjugation pathways in a set of neutral, anionic, and cationic expanded porphyrins were investigated by means of several aromaticity indices rooted in the structural, magnetic, and electronic criteria. Overall, our results reveal the predominance of the conjugation pathway that passes through all nitrogen atoms in all five&#8208;membered rings to describe the aromaticity of deprotonated expanded porphyrins, while the outer pathway through the perimeter carbon atoms becomes the most aromatic in protonated macrocycles. In nonplanar and charged macrocycles, a discrepancy between electronic and magnetic descriptors is observed. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates AV  min  &#160;remains the best tool to determine the main conjugation pathway of expanded porphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8209;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by the CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive and shows interesting features both in terms of cost&#8208;effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active by using the low catalytic loading of 1% mol and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed its recycle for three consecutive times without any decrease of performances. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate the CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines yielding oxazolidinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Design concepts for solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; a modern viewpoint on classical and non&#8208;classical approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation&#8208;sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used in metal halide perovskites. Due to their variable anion structures, similar family relations are still largely missing in group 15 halogenido metalates. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2 n I6 n +4]4&#8722;&#8208;family of anions, including the first n = 5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz = pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n = 1 &#8211; 5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72 eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8208; unit as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, providing a framework for understanding new and literature&#8208;known compounds in this emerging class of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient hydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles catalyzed by NNP&#8208;Manganese(I) pincer complexes at ambient temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions have aroused widespread interest in recent years. Among the catalytic systems described, especially PNP&#8208; and NNP&#8208;Mn pincer catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenation of aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, aldimines and esters. Furthermore, NNP&#8208;Mn pincer compounds are efficient catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of less reactive amides, ureas, carbonates, and carbamates. Here, we describe the synthesis and application of specific imidazolylaminophosphine ligands and the corresponding Mn pincer complexes. These new catalysts have been characterized and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations, and their catalytic activities have been tested in several hydrogenation reactions with good to excellent performance. Especially, the reduction of N&#8208;heterocycles can be performed under very mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Endoperoxides Compounds for Highly Efficient Cancer Treatment under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment has garnered great attention, with promising non&#8208;invasiveness, low side effects, and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumours remains a serious resistant factor to limit PDT effects.  Endoperoxides  are always utilized as chemical storage or supplier of singlet oxygen  (  1  O  2  ), the active substance for PDT in materials and other domains. Recent reports indicated that this type of compounds could remarkably enhance the therapeutic effects of PDT under hypoxia. This concept mainly introduces a few representative endoperoxides and outlook of their potent application for the treatment of hypoxic cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallic Catalysts for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Using CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO  2  (CO  2  &#8208;ODP) is a promising technique for realizing high&#8208;yield propylene production and CO  2  usage. Developing a highly efficient catalyst for CO  2  &#8208;ODP is essential and beneficial to the chemical industry and for realizing net&#8208;zero emissions. Many studies have investigated metal oxide&#8208;based catalysts, revealing that rapid deactivation and low selectivity remain limiting factors for their industrial applications. In recent years, metallic nanoparticle catalysts have become increasingly attractive due to their unique properties. Therefore, we summarize the performance of metal&#8208;based catalysts in CO  2  &#8208;ODP reactions by considering catalyst design concepts, different mechanisms in the reaction process, and the role of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversibly Porous Supramolecular Peptide Framework
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building&#8208;blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of an exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system.







Abstract
The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of an exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metal&#8208;peptide frameworks.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards ultrasensitive SERS analysis: Magneto&#8208;plasmonic dendrimer&#8208;based colloids have been explored for the adsorption and SERS detection of contaminants in water quality monitoring assisted by magnetic separation. Three chemical routes &#8211; crosslinking, chemical grafting, and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly &#8211; led to hybrid nanostructures with distinct potentialities.







Abstract
Chemical analyses in the field using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocols are expected to be part of several analytical procedures applied to water quality monitoring. To date, these endeavors have been supported by developments in SERS substrate nanofabrication, instrumentation portability, and the internet of things. Here, we report distinct chemical strategies for preparing magneto&#8208;plasmonic (Fe3O4&#8201;:&#8201;Au) colloids, which are relevant in the context of trace&#8208;level detection of water contaminants due to their inherent multifunctionality. The main objective of this research is to investigate the role of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAMs) in the preparation of SERS substrates integrating both functionalities into single nanostructures. Three chemical routes were investigated to design magneto&#8208;plasmonic nanostructures that translate into different ways for assessing SERS detection by using distinct interfaces. Hence, a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic colloids have been characterized and then assessed for their SERS activity by using a model pesticide (thiram) dissolved in aqueous samples.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate Dissolution from the Laboratory to the Ocean: Kinetics and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate chemistry: Although calcite dissolution has been extensively studied there appears to be a problem; apparent contradictions, discrepancies between laboratories and inconsistencies with field measurements seemingly pervade the literature. This review highlights how &#8211; in some circumstances &#8211; a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hindered development.







Abstract
The ultimate fate, over the course of millennia, of nearly all of the carbon dioxide formed by humankind is for it to react with calcium carbonate in the world's oceans. Although, this reaction is of global relevance, aspects of the calcite dissolution reaction remain poorly described with apparent contradictions present throughout the expansive literature. In this perspective we aim to evidence how a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hampered developments in this area. These insights have important implications for both idealised experiments performed under laboratory conditions and for the measurement and modelling of oceanic calcite sediment dissolution.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios and fast spin relaxation complicate their observations. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201490), R.&#8197;P. Martinho and L. Frydman explore indirect ways for detecting these sites with the help of proton detection, amplified by chemical exchanges with the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications are mediated by spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons, opening new avenues in spectroscopic MRI.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Epoxy/Surface Adhesion: Understanding the Interphase Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy resin coatings are commonly used to protect metal surfaces from corrosion. Molecular simulations are used to investigate the adhesion in an epoxy resin precursor to hematite and goethite surfaces, as a proxy for steel surfaces and the effect of water ingress. For hematite water always decreases the adhesion whilst for goethite a small amount of water increases adhesion to the surface.







Abstract
Epoxy resins coatings are commonly found in corrosion protection coatings but the presence of water can affect their adhesion to the substrate, often weakening the adhesion of the coating to the solid, reducing its efficiency. Nevertheless, small amounts of water can enhance the epoxy/substrate interactions. In this work, the interphase region of an epoxy precursor and metal oxide substrates is investigated using molecular simulations and it is found that water accumulates between the epoxy layer and the solid substrate. At high water concentrations (9&#8197;wt&#8201;%) the interaction between the epoxy precursor and the solid surface is weakened regardless of the nature of the solid, but at low water concentrations the nature of the solid surface becomes important. For hematite, the presence of water decreases the strength of adhesion but for goethite the presence of a small amount of water (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) enhances the adhesion to the surface resulting in a densification at the interface.

         <title>Templated Generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitor by Isomer&#8208;Free SPAAC Based on Azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>

Less strain, more gain. We present Fmoc&#8208;ACN as the first cyclononyne suitable for isomer&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC). We demonstrate its use for the rational design and protein&#8208;templated formation of a low&#8208;micromolar inhibitor of protein&#8211;protein interactions mediated by Bcl&#8208;xL. The lower intrinsic reactivity of cyclononynes as compared to cyclooctynes facilitated higher template effects and rate accelerations in the aqueous environment.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8211;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in aqueous environments.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Tailoring To Construct Ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) Nanosheets: Interactive CO2RR Promotion and Bismuth&#8208;Oxygen Moiety Preservation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Special morphology: Ultrathin Bi2O2O surface/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) substrate nanosheets were prepared through in&#8208;situ interlamellar hydrogen&#8208;bond tailoring strategies. The special morphology not only helps to facilitate production of the Bi2O2CO3 intermediate, but also enhances the resistance of Bi&#8722;O moieties to being reduced to promote formate production from CO2RR.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties are beneficial for high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to produce formate; however, preserving bismuth&#8208;oxygen moieties while applying a cathodic potential is challenging. This work reports the preparation of ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) nanosheets (BiON&#8208;uts) by in&#8208;situ tailoring of hydrogen bonds in a Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) precursor. The BiON&#8208;uts exhibits a formate faradaic efficiency of 98&#8201;% with higher partial current density than that of most reported bismuth&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion&#8208;exchange between BiON&#8208;uts and the electrolyte to produce Bi2O2CO3 as intermediate, and adsorption of CO2 with surface Bi2O2O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved by the high electron affinity of Bi2O2CO3. More importantly, high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR in turn protects the bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties from being reduced and thus helps to maintain the excellent CO2RR activity. This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO2RR promotion and bismuth&#8211;oxygen moiety preservation, opening up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Solution Structure of a Lanthanide&#8208;binding DNA Aptamer Determined Using High Quality pseudocontact shift restraints</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range paramagnetic NMR restraints remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acid systems. In this contribution we demonstrate that such restraints can be generated by a lanthanide ion bound to an intrinsic site provided by a DNA aptamer. By solving the 3D structure of the aptamer&#8208;Ln3+ complex we provide the structural basis for the introduction of similar sites into other DNA systems.







Abstract
In this contribution we report the high&#8208;resolution NMR structure of a recently identified lanthanide&#8208;binding aptamer (LnA). We demonstrate that the rigid lanthanide binding by LnA allows for the measurement of anisotropic paramagnetic NMR restraints which to date remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acids. One type of such restraints &#8208; pseudocontact shifts (PCS) induced by four different paramagnetic lanthanides &#8208; was extensively used throughout the current structure determination study and the measured PCS turned out to be exceptionally well reproduced by the final aptamer structure. This finding opens the perspective for a broader application of paramagnetic effects in NMR studies of nucleic acids through the transplantation of the binding site found in LnA into other DNA/RNA systems.

         <title>Revealing the Effect of Surface Composition on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Supported Pt&#8208;Fe Alloy Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic methanol oxidation: This work have been successfully fabricated property Pt&#8722;Fe alloy supported on the MWCNTs featuring nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The resulting structure is a highly active methanol oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
The designs of efficient and inexpensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are essential to boost the commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the highly catalytic performance PtFe alloys supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorating nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) have been successfully prepared via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst with moderate Fe3+ feeding content (0.86&#8197;mA/mgPt) exhibits 2.26&#8208;fold enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.38&#8197;mA/mgPt). Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71&#8197;V and 0.80&#8197;V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti&#8208;corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.

         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non&#8208;destructive characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native setting, e.g., comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNA) and hydrophobin proteins. including SC3, sheding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cell wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials for iodine capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively.  Cluster&#8208;based  crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications.  Herein, this paper reviews the recent progress of  different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture. The research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8211;azobenzene&#8211;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2  , to afford SP with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene&#8208; monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong inter&#8208;molecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SP, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SP.</dc:description>

Herein, we report on the first syntheses, and isolation of the three mixed valence silver NCs with Ag  12  Cl  3  , Ag  29  , and Ag  8  cores [((cAAC)P)  6  Ag  12  Cl  3  ](OTf)  3  (  1  ), [((cAAC)P)  6  Ag  29  ] (  2  ), and &#160;[((cAAC)P)  4  Ag  8  ] (  3  ) having three/two&#8208;fold symmetry, employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenides (cAACP  &#8722;  ) as the &#960;&#8208;accepting stabilizing ligand. The average diameters of the two Ag NC (  1  ,  2  ) are approximately of 1.6 to 2 nm. The redox non&#8208;innocent mono&#8208;atomic phosphorus anions (P  &#8722;  ) anchored with cAAC ligands are  in situ  generated by the reaction of AgOTf with a boryl&#8208;phosphaalkene (cAAC)P  &#8208;  B(N  i  Pr  2  )  2  via the cleavage of the P&#8722;B bond with the help of triflate anion (OTf  &#8722;  ) as a weak nucleophile. The equivalent numbers of the  in situ  generated (cAAC)P  &#8722;  anions are oxidized to produce the corresponding bis&#8208;phosphinidene (cAAC)  2  P  2  , leading to the generation of Ag(0) ions in solution for the formation of the unprecedented mixed valence Ag NC  2  . Complex  3  is achieved by the reaction of potassium phosphinidenide cAACPK with AgNTf  2  .The ligand field, and the steric hindrance of the (cAAC)P units play a crucial role for stabilization of the complexes  1  &#8208;  2  , further providing a three&#8208;fold stand. The Ag  12  Cl  3  NC  1  with tri&#8208;cationic core [Ag(I)  12  Cl  3  ] is found to be diamagnetic, and fluorescent, emitting green light at 563 nm when excited at 400 nm. Whereas, the neutral Ag  29  (  2  ), and Ag  8  (  3  ) clusters are found to be paramagnetic, and NMR silent showing characteristic EPR signals for Ag(0) at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Double Carbonylation of Nitroarenes with Aryl Halides Using Mo(CO)6 as a Reductant and Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides for the synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been reported. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)  6  as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl sources.&#160;Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that nitrosoarene was first generated as the key intermediate through nitro reduction. Remarkably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A study on the reactivity of several N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and the cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene cAACMe (1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with the tetrel hydrides GeH2Mes2 and SnH2Me2 (Me = CH3, Mes = 1,3,5&#8208;(CH3)3C6H2) is presented.

The reaction of SnH2Me2 with cAACMe also afforded the insertion product cAACMeH&#8211;SnHMe2 (3), the reaction of two equivalents Me2ImMe with SnH2Me2 gave the NHC&#8208;stabilized stannylene Me2ImMe&#8729;SnMe2 (4).

         <title>Stacking Interactions: a Supramolecular Approach to Upgrade Weak Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8226;ArX (ArX = PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  Cl, 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  Br, 4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br  2  C  6  H  4  ) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8943;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8943;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8943;N  cyano  halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5 kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)  2  &#8226;4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl (12.5 kcal/mol). Theoretical DFT calculations demonstrate the dramatic increase of X&#8943;N  cyano  HaB strength for stacked trimers in comparison with parent unstacked haloarenes.</dc:description>

Nucleoside  1  is a weak stabilizer of dA&#8208;dT base pairs, nucleoside  2  evokes strong stabilization. Strand displacement reactions used single&#8208;stranded invaders with single and multiple incorporations of stabilizers. Displacement is driven by negative enthalpy changes between target and displaced duplex. Toeholds are not required. Two new environmental sensitive fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the progress of displacement reactions. Pyrene was connected to the nucleobase in the invader or to a dendritic linker in the output strand. Both new sensors were constructed by click chemistry; phosphoramidites and oligonucleotides were prepared. Sensors show monomer or excimer emission. Fluorescence intensity changes when the displacement reaction progresses. Our work demonstrates, that strand displacement with base pair stabilizers is applicable to DNA, RNA and to related biopolymers with applications in chemical biology, nanotechnology and medicinal diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiply Twisted Chiral Macrocycles Clamped by Tethered Binaphthyls Exhibiting High Circularly Polarized Luminescence Brightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral macrocycles with multiple twisted structures have been synthesized as emissive chiroptical dyes by anchoring tethered chiral binaphthyls. The rigid molecular structure exhibits a high gCPL and quantum yield, leading to a high CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Chiral macrocyclic dimers, trimers, and tetramers composed of paraphenylene and tethered binaphthyl were synthesized, and their molecular structures and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that multiple twisted molecular structures &#8211; dimers, trimers, and tetramers &#8211; adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight, M&#246;bius triangle, and concave rectangle structures, respectively. These homologues have large &#1013; values in their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra because of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the naphthalene&#8208;phenylene&#8208;naphthalene frameworks. Owing to the shape&#8208;persistent ring structure and tethering with &#8722;OCH2CH2O&#8722;, high fluorescence quantum yields and a relatively high dissymmetry factor gCPL in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were achieved. This results in CPL brightness (BCPL) of over 100, which is greater than that of the conventional organic CPL dye.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control of Molecular Photoluminescent Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time is more! A review of how molecular emissive properties can be controlled in a dynamic time&#8208;dependent manner to give compounds that show great potential for designing smart luminescent materials with time&#8208;encoding features.







Abstract
Dynamic control of molecular photoluminescence offers chemical solutions to designing functional emissive materials. Although stimuli&#8208;switchable molecular luminescent systems are well established, how to encode these dynamic emissive systems with a &#8220;timing&#8221; feature, that is, time&#8208;dependent luminescent properties, remains challenging. This Concept aims to summarize the design principles of dynamic timing molecular photoluminescent systems by discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of this topic and the shaping of fabrication strategies at both the molecular and supramolecular levels. An outlook and perspectives are given to outline the future opportunities and challenges in the rational design and potential applications of these smart emissive systems.

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel nanoparticles of controlled arrangements of interacting enzymes can be produced intracellularly, purified from crude bacterial lysates in a one&#8208;step process, and used as stable materials in flow&#8208;through biocatalysis.







Abstract
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120&#8197;nm were produced intracellularly with an Escherichia coli&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo system. The inCell&#8208;AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the Lactobacillus brevis alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the Bacillus subtilis glucose&#8208;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell&#8208;AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two&#8208;step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell&#8208;AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole&#8208;cell flow biocatalysis, by which flow reactors could be operated for &gt;4&#8197;days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell&#8208;AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one&#8208;step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Improved Dye Survival in Expansion Microscopy through Stabilizer&#8208;Conjugated Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stabilizer&#8208;containing multifunctional molecules has been developed and evaluated in expansion microscopy. These multifunctional molecules not only enable effective protection of dyes from radicals during polymerization, but also improve photostability while showing no negative impact on polymerization.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples. However, reaction conditions inherent to the process bring about strong fluorescent signal loss during polymerization and digestion and thus limit the brightness of the signal obtained post expansion. Here, we explore the impact of stabilizer&#8208;containing organic fluorophores in ExM, as a mitigation strategy for this radical&#8208;induced dye degradation. Through direct conjugation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylalanine (NPA) to our previously developed trifunctional reagents, we validate and demonstrate that these multifunctional linkers enable visualization of different organelles with improved fluorescent intensity, owning to protection of the dyes to radical induced degradation as well as to photoprotection upon imaging. At this point, we cannot disentangle the relative contribution of both mechanisms. Furthermore, we report anchoring linkers that allow straightforward application of NPA or Trolox to commercially available fluorophore&#8208;conjugated antibodies. We show that these anchoring linkers enable complete retention of biological targets while increasing fluorophore photostability. Our results provide guidance in exploring these stabilizer&#8208;modified agents in ExM and methods for increased signal survival through the polymerization steps of the ExM protocols.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes that gather strong photo&#8208;oxidizing power and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption were prepared with the highly conjugated dph or bpph ligands. Biolayer interferometry and NCI Surface analyses show their avid binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA particularly arising from interaction within the G&#8208;quadruplex groove.







Abstract
Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible&#8208;light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible&#8208;light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible&#8208;light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures from the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed us to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.

         <title>1,2,5&#8208;Triarylcycloalka[c]arsoles: Structural Effects of Fused&#8208;cycloalkanes on Stability and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentane&#8208; and cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsoles were also synthesized. While the former was stable, the latter gradually decomposed to the corresponding diketone under ambient conditions owing to its frustrated structure. The frustration of the fused cyclohexane also caused large structural relaxation, resulting in a relatively large Stokes shift.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole 2&#8201;a gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused 1&#8201;a was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of 2&#8201;a (7766&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is larger than that of 1&#8201;a (5120&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in 2&#8201;a was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in 1&#8201;a was much less distorted.

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core&#8208;based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is an efficient way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as  TDBFSBF1  and  TDBFSBF2  were effectively developed.  TDBFSBF1  exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178 &#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5 eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0%, long operational lifetime at 50% of the initial luminance of 89,000 h, and low driving voltage at 1000 cd m  &#8722;2  of 2.95 V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using  TDBFSBF1  . Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#181;  h  value of 1.9 &#180; 10  &#8722;3  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  was recorded in  TDBFSBF2  . A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#181;  h  values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core&#8208;based HTLs.</dc:description>

         <title>s&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8211;H Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two s&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, &#160;with the more electropositive s&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8211;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive s&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8211;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8211;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationship of Cyano&#8208; Functionalized Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.</dc:description>

The third dimension of arynes. Synthetic equivalents of enantiopure bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL can be generated and reacted in solution with various arynophiles for the fully enantiospecific syntheses of congested large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon atropisomers.







Abstract
The synthetic equivalents of the enantiopure binaphthyl bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;naphtol) featuring a stereogenic axis vicinal to the two reactive triple bonds can be generated for the first time in solution in an enantiospecific manner. Using a two&#8208;step sequence based on the bidirectional [4+2] cycloaddition of furan derivatives followed by an aromatizative deoxygenation reaction, several 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bianthracenyl&#8208;based atropisomers could be prepared enantiospecifically in high enantiomeric purity. Alternatively, bidirectional reactions with anthracene, 2&#8208;bromostyrene, and perylene as the arynophiles afforded very congested bis(benzotriptycene), bis(tetraphene) and bis(anthra[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene) nanocarbon atropisomers in equally high enantiomeric purity. In complement, cross reactions with two different arynophiles revealed possible. The unusual atropisomer prototypes described in this study open the way to enantiopure nanographene atropisomers designed for functions.

Abstract
Currently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels is accompanied by massive emissions of CO2, leading to severe energy shortages and intensified global warming. It is of great significance to develop and use renewable clean energy while reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Photocatalytic technology is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide conversion. Clearly, the achievement of the above goals largely depends on the design and construction of catalysts. This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to their structure and performance is emphasized. Finally, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO2 with high efficiency, even for practical applications are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Catalysts as Key Enablers for the Synthesis of Bioplastics with Sophisticated Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioplastics are one of the answers to environmental pollution and linear material flows. The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. Copolymerizations of lactide (LA) with other lactones like &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) have been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling a copolymerization remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerizations of LA with other monomer classes are much less investigated but bear the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization condition or their non&#8208;standard mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of E4 (E4 = P4, As4, AsP3) towards low&#8208;valent Al(I) and Ga(I) compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 towards low&#8208;valent group 13 compounds was investigated. The reactions of [LAl] (1, L = [{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8208;) with As4 and AsP3 lead to [(LAl)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4 = As4 (3b), AsP3 (3c)) by insertion of two fragments [LAl] into two of the six E&#8208;E edges of the E4 tetrahedra. Furthermore, the reaction of [LGa]&#160;(2) with E4 afforded [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4 = As4 (4b), AsP3 (4c)). In these compounds, only one E&#8208;E bond of the E4 tetrahedra was cleaved. These compounds represent the first examples of the conversion of yellow arsenic and AsP3, respectively, with group 13 compounds. Furthermore, the reactivity of the gallium complexes towards unsaturated transition metal units or polypnictogen (En) ligand complexes was investigated. This leads to the heterobimetallic compounds [(LGa)(&#956;,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)(LNi)] (5a), [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;E4)(LGa)] (E = P (6a), As (6b), Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = &#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) and [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#951;3:1:1&#8208;E3)(LGa)] (E = P (7a), As (7b)), which combine two different ligand systems in one complex (nacnac and Cp) as well as two different types of metals (main group and transition metals).

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Effective Photodynamic Therapy against Hypoxic Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organelle&#8208;targeted type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows great potential to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an indispensable organelle in cells with important biological functions. When ER is damaged due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the accumulation of misfolded proteins will interfere with ER homeostasis, resulting in ER stress. Here, an ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was presented. ER targeting modification significantly reduced the dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). NBS&#8208;ER could effectively produce O  2  &#713;&#729;with near&#8208;infrared irradiation, making its phototoxicity under hypoxia close to that under normoxia. Meanwhile, the photoinduced ROS triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis. In addition, NBS&#8208;ER possessed excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating CoFeOX Nanosheets Towards Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas: Effect of Calcination Temperature and Mixed&#8208;Valence Multi&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CoFeOX  nanosheets were synthesized by a facile coprecipitation and calcination method. The effect of calcination temperature on the crystal texture, morphology and surface areas of CoFeOX  were fully explored. CoFeOX  sample calcined at 600 &#176;C (CoFeOX  &#8208;600) showed superior catalytic performance for the reduction of CO2  under visible light. Compared with the pure Ru(bpy)32+  &#8208;sensitized CO2  reduction system, the CoFeOX  &#8208;added system achieved 19&#8208;fold enhancement of CO production (45.7 &#956;mol/h). The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX  cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer and abundant CO2  active adsorption sites exposure, which promote the separation of photogenerated charges, and thus improve the photocatalytic CO2  reduction activity. Carbon source of CO from CO2  was verified by  13CO2  isotopic labelling experiment. Repeated activity experiments confirmed the good stability of CoFeOX  in the CO2  photoreduction system. This work would provide prospective insights into developing novel cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and durable non&#8208;precious metal cocatalysts to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic modulation of thiol functionalities in inexpensive porous polymers for effective mercury removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) contamination in aquatic systems still poses serious health risks through accumulation despite the strict regulations on drinking water and industrial discharge. One effective strategy is adsorptive removal, where a suitably functionalized porous material is added to water treatment protocols. Thiol (SH) group grafted structures perform commendably without due attention to the cost, scalability, and reusability and how the arrangement of sulfur atoms could affect the Hg (II) binding strength. We use an inexpensive and scalable porous covalent organic polymer (COP&#8208;130) to systematically introduce thiol functional groups with precise chain lengths and sulfur content. The thiol&#8208;functionalized COP&#8208;130 demonstrates enhanced wettability and excellent Hg (II) uptake up to 936 mg g&#8208;1, with fast kinetics and exceptionally high selectivity. These Hg adsorbents are easily regenerated with HCl and used at least six times even after strong acid treatments without loss of capacity, a rare performance in the Hg removal research domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Push&#8208;Pull Diphenylsulfone Derivatives towards Aggregation&#8208;Induced Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband deep&#8208;blue  thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted significant attention. Herein, four asymmetrical structured TADF emitters based on diphenylsulfone (DPS) acceptor and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) donor with progressive performances were developed. The te  rt  &#8208;butyloxy auxiliary electron&#8208;donor was adopted to restrict the intramolecular rotations and provide efficient steric hindrance. Regioisomerization by altering the substitution position of DMAC on DPS unit further enhanced the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular interactions.  The accompanying effects yielded increased energy level, minimized reorganization energy, and inhibited non&#8208;radiative transitions in the crystals of t  BuO&#8208;SO m  AD  , which achieved narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 424 nm (FWHM = 64 nm, &#934;  F  = 33.6%) through aggregation&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE). In addition, deep&#8208;blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on t  BuO&#8208;SO m  AD  realized the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum peaking located at 435 nm and CIE coordination of (0.12, 0.09).</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the active oxidants involved in cytochrome P450 catalyzed sulfoxidation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of the C&#8208;H bonds of organic molecules. This reaction is initiated by a ferryl&#8208;oxo heme radical cation (Cpd I). These enzymes can also catalyze sulfoxidation reactions and the ferric&#8208;hydroperoxy complex (Cpd 0) and the Fe(III)&#8211;H  2  O  2  complex have been proposed as alternative oxidants for this transformation. To investigate this, we compared the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylthiobenzoic acids and 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid by the CYP199A4 enzyme from  Rhodopseudomonas palustris  HaA2 using both monooxygenase and peroxygenase pathways. By examining mutants at the mechanistically important, conserved acid alcohol&#8208;pair (D251N, T252A and T252E) we were able to disturb the relative amounts of the reactive intermediates that would form in these reactions. Substrate binding and X&#8208;ray crystal structures enabled us to understand changes in the activity and attempt to evaluate whether multiple oxidants can participate in these reactions. In peroxygenase reactions the T252E mutant had higher activity towards sulfoxidation than  O  &#8208;demethylation but in the monooxygenase reactions with the WT enzyme the activity of both reactions was similar. The peroxygenase activity of the T252A mutant was greater for sulfoxidation reactions than the WT enzyme, which is the reverse of the activity changes observed for  O  &#8208;demethylation. The monooxygenase activity and coupling efficiency of sulfoxidation and oxidative demethylation were reduced by similar degrees with the T252A mutant. These observations infer that while Cpd I is required for  O  &#8208;dealkylation, another oxidant may contribute to sulfoxidation. Based on the activity of the CYP199A4 mutants we propose that this is the Fe(III)&#8211;H  2  O  2  complex which would be more abundant in the peroxide&#8208;driven reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of RGO&#8208;Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures via PVA&#8208;assisted Freeze&#8208;casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped&#8208;carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze&#8208;casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increases from 0 to 15 mg&#183;ml  &#8208;1  , the average pore size of the aerogel reduces from 154 to 45 &#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound are optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO&#8208;10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8208;6300Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8208;47.3 dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0 mm). Prospectively, this synthetic strategy can be extended to develop other forms of elastic aerogel with a controlled pore size.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The emergence of (CH  3  NH  3  )PbI  3  has brought the development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) structures with ABX  3  type to a higher level, however, most 3D frameworks are constructed by corner&#8208;sharing of BX  6  octahedra. Here, we substituted the spherical molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2.2.2&#8208;dabco) with 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;dabcn) as a template to react with RbX (X = Br and I) in the corresponding HX acids under the consideration of reducing the molecular symmetry. Two 3D OIHP compounds [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H  2  dabcn]RbI  3  &#183;H  2  O (  1  ) and [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H  2  dabcn]RbBr  3  (  2  ) crystallized in non&#8208;centrosymmetric point group  mm  2 before the phase transition point were isolated. Among them, the 3D inorganic framework of  1  is constructed by sharing the corner of [RbI  6  ] octahedra, while that of  2  is constructed by sharing the corner and face of [RbBr  6  ] octahedra to acquire large cavities to accommodate the organic amine cation [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H  2  dabcn]  2+  , this 3D framework type is unprecedented in the OIHPs. As expected, compounds  1  and  2  exhibit reversible phase transition, dielectric and second harmonic generation (SHG) and ferroelectric properties, in which the phase transition temperature of  2  at 374 K is much higher than compound  1  at 280 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies Towards the Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotic Cadaside B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non&#8208;cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on&#8208;resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different  1  H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>

The unusual structures of DNA and RNA repeats play a key role in the development of some human neurodegenerative diseases which are also called as repeat expansion diseases. Therapeutic targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats with small&#8208;molecule drugs offers a potential way to cure repeat expansion diseases.







Abstract
Expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs) in the human genome cause nearly 50 neurodegenerative diseases, which are mostly inheritable, nonpreventable and incurable, posing as a huge threat to human health. Non&#8208;B DNAs formed by STRs are thought to be structural intermediates that can cause repeat expansions. The subsequent transcripts harboring expanded RNA repeats can further induce cellular toxicity through forming specific structures. Direct targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats has emerged as a new potential therapeutic strategy to cure repeat expansion diseases. In this conceptual review, we first introduce the roles of DNA and RNA structures in the genetic instabilities and pathomechanisms of repeat expansion diseases, then describe structural features of DNA and RNA repeats with a focus on the tertiary structures determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and finally discuss recent progress and perspectives of developing chemical tools that target pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats for curing repeat expansion diseases.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Borylated Pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Alkenyl Boronates and Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidine building blocks with various substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;rich derivatives) through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylide is disclosed. The target compounds were prepared on a multigram scale, and their potential for C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions is illustrated.







Abstract
A scalable and efficient process for the preparation of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;benzyl azomethine ylide generated in&#8197;situ has been developed. The optimized method included the use of LiF in DMSO at 110&#8201;&#176;C and was suitable for &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208;, and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;(hetera)cycloalkylidene&#8208;, CO2Et&#8208;, as well as most &#946;&#8208;(het)aryl&#8208;substituted alkenyl boropinacolates. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction proceeded on a multigram scale providing 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) in a diastereoselective manner. The Pd(OH)2&#8208;mediated N&#8208;debenzylation of pyrrolidine hydrochlorides was successfully performed to give the corresponding bifunctional building blocks on an up to 130&#8197;g scale, thus providing a substantial expansion of the synthetic and medicinal chemist's toolbox. Other reactions included the preparation of trifluoroborates, Zweifel&#8208;Aggarwal sp3&#8208;sp2 coupling, and oxidative deborylation as an example of C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation.

         <title>A Supramolecular Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclic Oligomers and Polymers by Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a thiourea derivative (the guest) to an unstrained, olefin&#8208;containing macrocycle (the monomer), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst, initiates a rapid ring&#8208;expansion reaction. The role of the guest is to inhibit a ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer and this leads to the selective formation of cyclic oligomers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of strained macrocycles is a key method to prepare diverse polymers. However, lack of ring strain in most macrocycles is an impediment to polymerization. In this paper, the polymerization/oligomerization of unstrained macrocycles was achieved using a supramolecular approach, leading selectively to cyclic products. Diphenyl thiourea and other guest molecules were used as additives to the ROMP reaction of unstrained macrocycles. An intermediate host&#8208;guest complex leads to the stabilization of the open form of the macrocycle after treatment with Grubbs catalysts, thereby favoring polymerization by inhibiting the ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enables ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of unstrained macrocycles leading to cyclic polymers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.

         <title>Improved Reversible Zinc Storage Achieved in a Constitutionally Crystalline&#8208;Stable Mn(VO3)2 Nanobelts Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode presents the specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain a capacity retention rate of 92&#8201;% for 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also rendered good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 even under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Benefiting from the unique tunnel type nanobelts structure, the Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts show high Zn2+ migration kinetics and stable framework for reversible ions de&#8208;/insertion.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid&#8208;scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next&#8208;generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The as&#8208;synthesized Mn(VO3)2 exhibited high specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and maintained a capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 10,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts impart fast Zn2+ ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.

It also rendered good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 600&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Benefiting from the unique tunnel type nanobelts structure, the Mn(VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts show high Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migration kinetics and stable framework for reversible ions de-/insertion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid-scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next-generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline-stable Mn(VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized Mn(VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited high specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and maintained a capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 10,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 600 cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts impart fast Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H Activation Reactions at Ru/Ga Complexes: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Case Study on the Ru&#8722;Ga Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/Ga compounds activate Si&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds. Triethylsilane and toluene are activated by the intermediate [Ru(GaCp*)3H2] and form the respective seven&#8208;fold coordinated Ru/Ga species. The bonding situation of the intermediate, the products, and their respective phosphine analogues are analyzed on the DFT level of theory, and the Ru&#8722;Ga and Ru&#8722;P bond are contrasted.







Abstract
Treatment of [Ru(COD)(MeAllyl)2] and [Ru(COD)(COT)] with GaCp* under hydrogenolytic conditions leads to reactive intermediates which activate Si&#8722;H or C&#8722;H bonds, respectively. The product complexes [Ru(GaCp*)3(SiEt3)H3] (1) and [Ru(GaCp*)3(C7H7)H3] (2) are formed with HSiEt3 or with toluene as the solvent, respectively. While 1 was isolated and fully characterized by NMR, MS, IR and SC&#8208;XRD, 2 was too labile to be isolated and was observed and characterized in&#8197;situ by using mass spectrometry, including labelling experiments for the unambiguous assignment of the elemental composition. The structural assignment was confirmed by DFT calculations. The relative energies of the four isomers possible upon toluene activation at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, para&#8208; and CH3&#8208;positions have been determined and point to aromatic C&#8722;H activation. The Ru&#8722;Ga bond was analyzed by EDA and QTAIM and compared to the Ru&#8722;P bond in the analogue phosphine compound. Bonding analyses indicate that the Ru&#8208;GaCp* bond is weaker than the Ru&#8208;PR3 bond.

The built&#8208;in electric field formed in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx Schottky&#8208;heterojunction hybrids coupled with in&#8197;situ photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reactions to remove phenolic pollution under the visible light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant active sites, a class of materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands, is widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. However, the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers of MOFs limits its photocatalytic degradation performance. Herein, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets&#8208;based NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe) hybrids with Schottky&#8208;heterojunctions were fabricated by in&#8197;situ hydrothermal assembly for improved photocatalytic activity. The photodegradation efficiencies of the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx (N&#8208;M/T) hybrids for phenol and chlorophenol were 96.36&#8201;% and 99.83&#8201;% within 60&#8197;minutes, respectively. The N&#8208;M/T Schottky&#8208;heterojunction duly transferred electrons to the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets surface via built&#8208;in electric fields, effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe). Moreover, the Fe&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence in the N&#8208;M/T led to improvement in the efficiency of the in&#8197;situ generated photo&#8208;Fenton reactions, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity with more generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The study proposes a highly effective removal of phenolic pollutants in wastewater.

Hooked on c&#8208;myc: A series of organoplatinum(II) compounds with diverse amino&#8208;acid&#8208;inspired side&#8208;chains exhibit high affinity and binding selectivity for the c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, along with significant emission enhancement and optical selectivity for this target vs. other DNA topologies. The compounds behave as efficient c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Insights on the nature of their interaction with c&#8208;myc were gained via resonance Raman investigation and docking simulation studies, highlighting the importance of the side&#8208;chains for the interaction.







Abstract
Organometallic molecules offer some of the most promising scaffolds for interaction with G&#8208;quadruplex nucleic acids. We report the efficient synthesis of a family of organoplatinum(II) complexes, featuring a 2&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6&#8208;yl)phenyl tridentate (N&#8743;N&#8743;C) ligand, that incorporates peripheral side&#8208;chains aiming at enhancing and diversifying its interaction capabilities. These include a di&#8208;isopropyl carbamoyl amide, a morpholine ethylenamide, two enantiomeric proline imides and an oxazole. The binding affinities of the Pt&#8208;complexes were evaluated via UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence titrations, against 5 topologically&#8208;distinct DNA structures, including c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, two telomeric (22AG) G&#8208;quadruplexes, a duplex (ds26) and a single&#8208;stranded (polyT) DNA. All compounds exhibited binding selectivity in favour of c&#8208;myc, with association constants (Ka) in the range of 2&#8211;5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1, lower affinity for both folds of 22AG and for ds26 and negligible affinity for polyT. Remarkable emission enhancements (up to 200&#8208;fold) upon addition of excess DNA were demonstrated by a subset of the compounds with c&#8208;myc, providing a basis for optical selectivity, since optical response to all other tested DNAs was low. A c&#8208;myc DNA&#8208;melting experiment showed significant stabilizing abilities for all compounds, with the most potent binder, the morpholine&#8208;Pt&#8208;complex, exhibiting a &#916;Tm&gt;30&#8201;&#176;C, at 1&#8201;:&#8201;5 DNA&#8208;to&#8208;ligand molar ratio. The same study implied contributions of the diverse side&#8208;chains to helix stabilization. To gain direct evidence of the nature of the interactions, mixtures of c&#8208;myc with the four most promising compounds were studied via UV Resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, which revealed end&#8208;stacking binding mode, combined with interactions of side&#8208;chains with loop nucleobase residues. Docking simulations were conducted to provide insights into the binding modes for the same four Pt&#8208;compounds, suggesting that the binding preference for two alternative orientations of the c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex thymine &#8216;cap&#8217; (&#8216;open&#8217; vs. &#8216;closed&#8217;), as well as the relative contributions to affinity from end&#8208;stacking and H&#8208;bonding, are highly dependent on the nature of the interacting Pt&#8208;complex side&#8208;chain.

A c-myc DNA-melting experiment showed significant stabilizing abilities for all compounds, with the most potent binder, the morpholine-Pt-complex, exhibiting a &#916;T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;30&#8201;&#176;C, at 1&#8201;:&#8201;5 DNA-to-ligand molar ratio. The same study implied contributions of the diverse side-chains to helix stabilization. To gain direct evidence of the nature of the interactions, mixtures of c-myc with the four most promising compounds were studied via UV Resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, which revealed end-stacking binding mode, combined with interactions of side-chains with loop nucleobase residues. Docking simulations were conducted to provide insights into the binding modes for the same four Pt-compounds, suggesting that the binding preference for two alternative orientations of the c-myc G-quadruplex thymine &#8216;cap&#8217; (&#8216;open&#8217; vs. &#8216;closed&#8217;), as well as the relative contributions to affinity from end-stacking and H-bonding, are highly dependent on the nature of the interacting Pt-complex side-chain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Strained Metal Vinylidene and Metal Carbyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic metal vinylidene with high ring&#8208;strain was obtained via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The reactivity of this metal vinylidene with nucleophiles and electrophiles was investigated, resulting in unprecedented conversion of the metal vinylidene to a metal carbyne in five&#8208;membered ring.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot reaction producing a metal vinylidene structure in a five&#8208;membered ring by cyclization of a multiyne has been achieved. The ring strain and the high stability of the cyclic metal vinylidene complexes have been analyzed experimentally and computationally. The metal vinylidene unit in a fused&#8208;ring complex is unreactive to both nucleophiles and electrophiles. It reacts however at the nearby carbonyl group achieving the unprecedented conversion of metal tributing factors for the aromaticity&#8208;driven process has been studied by DFT calculations.

         <title>An Iodide&#8208;Mediated Anodic Amide Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and robust methodology towards a direct condensation of carboxylic acids and amines has been realized in a versatile electrochemical approach, using a combination of triphenylphosphine and iodide as coupling reagent. A broad scope of different amides and dipeptides were accessible by the presented method, without the need for pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting materials.







Abstract
The ubiquity of amide bonds, present in natural products and common pharmaceuticals renders this functional group one of the most prevalent in organic chemistry. Despite its importance and a wide variety of existing methods for its formation, the latter still can be a challenge for classical activating reagents such as chloridating agents or carbodiimides. As the spent reagents often cannot be recycled, the development of more sustainable methods is highly desirable. Herein, we report an operationally simple and mild indirect electrochemical protocol to effect the condensation of carboxylic acids with amines, forming a wide variety of carboxamides.

         <title>Chiral Motifs in Highly Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Formed from Achiral Tetrahedral Ligands
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydral achiral ligands and copper ions assemble into a record number of interpenetrating diamondoid networks. The networks intertwine akin to strands of a molecular rope to shape the chiral channels. The design of the ligand &#8220;arms&#8221; allows modulating their degree of interpenetration and the channel properties. The concurrent presence of such numerous interpenetrated networks and porosity is unprecedented for metal&#8211;organic frameworks.







Abstract
Formation of highly interpenetrated frameworks is demonstrated. An interesting observation is the presence of very large adamantane&#8208;shaped cages in a single network, making these crystals new entries in the collection of diamondoid&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The frameworks were constructed by assembling tetrahedral pyridine ligands and copper dichloride. Currently, the networks&#8217; degree of interpenetration is among the highest reported and increases when the size of the ligand is increased. Highly interpenetrated frameworks typically have low surface contact areas. In contrast, in our systems, the voids take up to 63&#8201;% of the unit cell volume. The MOFs have chiral features but are formed from achiral components. The chirality is manifested by the coordination chemistry around the metal center, the structure of the helicoidal channels, and the motifs of the individual networks. Channels of both handednesses are present within the unit cells. This phenomenon shapes the walls of the channels, which are composed of 10, 16, or 32 chains correlated with the degree of interpenetration 10&#8208;, 16&#8208;, and 32&#8208;fold, respectively. By changing the distance between the center of the ligand and the coordination moieties, we succeeded in tuning the diameter of the channels. Relatively large channels were formed, having diameters up to 31.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;14.8&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signature of Dynamical Instability of the Aqueous Complex in the Brown&#8208;Ring Nitrate Test

Dynamical instabilities in the brown&#8208;ring test: Hydration dynamics around the iron nitrosyl moiety leads to an equilibrium between two complexes, with very different UV&#8208;vis spectra. Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and ab&#8208;initio multi&#8208;reference methods predict that classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex in aqueous solution. The features of the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectrum can be theoretically reproduced only by accounting these two species and not the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone.







Abstract
The chemistry of the brown&#8208;ring test has been investigated for nearly a century. Though recent studies have focused on solid state structure determination and measurement of spectra, mechanistic details and kinetics, the aspects of solution structure and dynamics remain unknown. We have studied structural fluctuations of the brown&#8208;ring complex in aqueous solution with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations, from which we identified that the classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex. Based on the inability in multi&#8208;reference calculations to reproduce the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectra in aqueous solution by inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone, we propose the existence of an equilibrium between pseudo&#8208;octahedral and square&#8208;pyramidal complexes. Despite challenges in constructing models reproducing the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum, the advanced spectrum simulation tool motivates us to challenge the established picture of a sole pseudo&#8208;octahedral complex in solution.

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopy Elucidates the Inhibitor Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Dependent Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenases (FDH) are capable of oxidizing formate to CO2 reversibly. Here, we compared IR spectroscopic data with DFT calculations and inhibition kinetics to study the putative binding mode of CO2/formate at the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor with the help of isoelectronic and charged product analogues. Experimental and theoretical data exclude a direct binding of the inhibitor molecules to the bis&#8208;MGD.







Abstract
Biological carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO2 at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites relevant for the mechanism, we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO2 and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding, whereby the inhibitor is in case of the latter interaction presumably bound between the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587.

         <title>Selective Iron Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkylated Indolines and Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to classical iron&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylations of indoles via the borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology, this contribution describes the switch of the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Starting from indolines, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently done using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol. Notably, performing the one pot N&#8208;alkylation of indolines, followed by oxidation using a FeBr3/TEMPO catalyst with t&#8208;BuOOH, the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles were obtained.







Abstract
Whereas iron catalysts usually promote catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives via a borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology using alcohols as the electrophilic partners, this contribution shows how to switch the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Thus, starting from indoline derivatives, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently performed using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in trifluoroethanol in the presence of alcohols leading to the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoline derivatives in 31&#8211;99&#8201;% yields (28&#8197;examples). The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy for the selective N&#8208;alkylation of indolines is completed by an oxidation to give the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles in 31&#8211;90&#8201;% yields (15&#8197;examples). This unprecedented oxidation methodology involves an iron salt catalyst associated with (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and a stoichiometric amount of t&#8208;BuOOH at room temperature.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Electron Density Analysis of Chemical Bonding in the Graphitic Carbon Nitride Precursor Melamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odd one out: Melamine is the precursor for the polycondensation reaction to graphitic carbon nitride materials with a range of important applications. It is found that one amine group in melamine is significantly different from the others, and based on extensive analysis of the experimental and theoretical electron density this particular amine group is suggested to be the origin of the condensation process.







Abstract
Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g&#8208;CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave&#8208;like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3&#8197;&#197; similar to that of g&#8208;CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction data measured at 25&#8197;K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra&#8208; and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions. Theoretical gas&#8208;phase optimizations of the experimental molecular geometry show that bond lengths and angles for atoms in the same chemical environment (C&#8722;N bonds in the ring, amine groups) differ significantly more for the experimental geometry than for the gas&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized geometries, indicating that intermolecular interactions in the crystal affects the molecular geometry. In the experimental crystal geometry, one amine group has significantly more sp3&#8208;like character than the others, hinting at a possible formation mechanism of g&#8208;CN. Topological analysis and energy frameworks show that the nitrogen atom in this amine group participates in weak intralayer hydrogen bonding. We hypothesize that melamine condenses to g&#8208;CN within the layers and that the unique amine group plays a key role in the condensation process.

         <title>Meso&#8208;Carbon Atom Nucleophilic Attack Susceptibility in the Sterically Strained Antiaromatic Bis&#8208;BODIPY Macrocycle and Extended Electron&#8208;Deficient BODIPY Precursor

A sterically strained and non&#8208;fluorescent antiaromatic macrocycle which has two BODIPY subunits linked by p&#8208;divinylphenyl bridges has been prepared and characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and theoretical methods. It has an unusual susceptibility to the nucleophilic attack at the meso&#8208;carbon atom.







Abstract
A sterically strained 32&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic bis&#8208;BODIPY macrocycle in which two BODIPY fragments are linked by p&#8208;divinylbenzene groups was prepared and characterized. Unlike regular BODIPYs, the fluorescence in this macrocycle is quenched. The broad signals in the NMR spectra of the macrocycle were explained by the vibronic freedom of the p&#8208;divinylbenzene fragments. The possible diradicaloid nature of the macrocycle was excluded on the basis of variable&#8208;temperature EPR spectra in solution and in solid state, which is indicative of its closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure. The meso&#8208;C&#8722;H bond in the macrocycle and its precursor BODIPY dialdehyde 3 forms a weak hydrogen bond with THF and is susceptible for the nucleophilic attack by organic amines and cyanide anion. The reaction products of such a nucleophilic attack have meso&#8208;sp3 carbon atoms and were characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry and, in one case, X&#8208;ray crystallography. Unlike the initial bis&#8208;BODIPY macrocycle, the adducts have strong fluorescence in the 400&#8197;nm region. The electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of new chromophores were probed by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations and correlate well with the experimental data.

         <title>Optical Modulation of Antibiotic Resistance by Photoswitchable Cystobactamids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cystobactamids, natural products with potent antibiotic properties, have been equipped with mono&#8208; or double&#8208;photoswitches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties, but also the sensitivity towards the two resistance factors AlbD and and AlbA was light&#8208;dependent.







Abstract
The rise of antibiotic resistance causes a serious health care problem, and its counterfeit demands novel, innovative concepts. The combination of photopharmacology, enabling a light&#8208;controlled reversible modulation of drug activity, with antibiotic drug design has led to first photoswitchable antibiotic compounds derived from established scaffolds. In this study, we converted cystobactamids, gyrase&#8208;inhibiting natural products with an oligoaryl scaffold and highly potent antibacterial activities, into photoswitchable agents by inserting azobenzene in the N&#8208;terminal part and/or an acylhydrazone moiety near the C&#8208;terminus, yielding twenty analogs that contain mono&#8208; as well as double&#8208;switches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties could be modulated 3.4&#8208;fold and 5&#8208;fold by light, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of photoswitchable cystobactamids towards two known resistance factors, the peptidase AlbD and the scavenger protein AlbA, was light&#8208;dependent. While irradiation of an analog with an N&#8208;terminal azobenzene with 365&#8197;nm light led to less degradation by AlbD, the AlbA&#8208;mediated inactivation was induced. This provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that resistance towards photoswitchable antibiotics can be optically controlled.

         <title>Isolation of Elusive Phosphinidene&#8208;Chlorotetrylenes: The Heavier Cyanogen Chloride Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>

Elusive hetero&#8208;bileptic carbenes&#8208;stabilized singlet phosphinidiene&#8208;chlorosilylene, and chlorogermylenes with majorly contributing covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bonds are isolated and structurally characterized in the solid state.







Abstract
The elusive phosphinidene&#8208;chlorotetrylenes, [PGeCl] and [PSiCl] have been stabilized by the hetero&#8208;bileptic cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, and isolated in the solid state at room temperature as the first neutral monomeric species of this class with the general formulae (L)P&#8208;ECl(L&#8242;) (E=Ge, 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c; E=Si, 6; L=cAAC; L&#8242;=NHC). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c have been synthesized by the reaction of cAAC&#8208;supported potassium phosphinidenides [cAAC=PK(THF)x]n (1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c) with the adduct NHC:&#8594;GeCl2 (2). Similarly, compound 6 has been synthesized via reaction of 1&#8201;a with NHC:&#8594;SiCl2 adduct (4). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c, and 6 have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometric analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the heteroatom P in 3 bears two lone pairs; the non&#8208;bonding pair with 67.8&#8201;% of s&#8208; and 32&#8201;% of p character, whereas the other lone pair is involved in &#960; backdonation to the CcAAC&#8208;N &#960;* of cAAC. The Ge atom in 3 contains a lone pair with 80&#8201;% of s character, and slightly involved in the &#960; backdonation to CNHC. EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses showed that two charged doublet fragments {(cAAC)(NHC)}+, and {PGeCl}&#8722; prefer to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, one dative &#963; bond, one dative &#960; bond, and a charge polarized weak &#960; bond. The covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond contributes to the major stabilization energy to the total orbital interaction energy of 3, enabling the first successful isolations of this class of compounds (3, 6) in the laboratory.

The electrochemical coupling of amines and carboxylic acids generates a wide variety of amides and dipeptides. The operationally simple and robust process is mediated by iodide and produces triphenylphosphine oxide as a recyclable co&#8208;product. A combination of boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) anode and a platinum cathode ensures maximum performance. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Opatz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201768). Artwork by L.M.G. based on an idea by T.O.

         <title>An Introduction to the Combustion of Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 54, September 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Looking back over centuries of research on carbon combustion, this reaction has literally fuelled the development of mankind and truly astonishing technological advancement. Carbon combustion is complex and interplay of different limitations such as diffusion, heat/mass transfer, and reactivity of active sites is observed. The understanding and a unifying concept of carbon combustion may prove to be valuable also for the understanding of novel carbon nanomaterials, such as fibres or graphene like materials.







Abstract
Combustion is arguably as old as homo sapiens ability to observe and use fire. Despite the long tradition of using carbon combustion for energy production, this reaction is still not fully understood. This can be related to several facts that are intertwined and complicate the investigation, such as the large variety of possible carbon structures, the actual surface structure, porosity, the solid&#8208;gas nature of this reaction, diffusion limitation and fundamental reaction steps. In this review, a brief history of carbon combustion science is given, followed by a detailed discussion of the most important aspects of carbon combustion. Special attention is given to limitations for example diffusion. In carbon combustion, kinetic control can rarely be observed. The literature of the fundamental reaction steps actually occurring on the carbon framework is reviewed and it becomes apparent that the reaction is occurring primarily on defects on the basal plane. Thus, the reaction between oxygen and carbon may be used as an analytical tool to provide further insights into novel materials, for example synthetic carbon materials, fibres and graphene type materials. Mastering the combustion reaction in all its complexity may prove to be very valuable in the future.

         <title>Restrictive Regulation of Ionic Liquid Quaternary Ammonium Salt in SBA&#8208;15 Pore Channel for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBA&#8208;15 with metal based quaternary ammonium salt was used for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. Ionic liquids grafting into the pore channel of SBA&#8208;15 provide an alternative chance to improve the catalytic performance at 1.5&#8197;MPa and 90 &#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of a new type of catalyst, SBA&#8722;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction, is described. Various amounts of ionic liquid were grafted into the pore channels of SBA&#8208;15 using the post&#8208;grafting method, which allowed the ionic liquid to be grafted into the pore channels restrictively. Notably, over six cycles, SBA&#8722;Mn (0.2) has been shown to maintain its catalytic activity and stability. In addition, a reaction mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides based on density&#8208;functional theory is proposed. The cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. It is demonstrated that the metal coordinated with the oxygen atom of the epoxides and that a halogen attacked the carbon of epoxides. Moreover, theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy provide a new approach for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Cytochrome Involved in Geobacter sulfurreducens&#8217; Electron Harvesting Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The periplasmic cytochrome GSU2515 is crucial for the electron harvesting pathways of Geobacter sulfurreducens, a suitable bacterium to apply in microbial electrosynthesis technologies. The biophysical characterization of GSU2515 together with biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments highlighted how electrons are conducted within the periplasm and pave the way for understanding the bacterium's electron harvesting pathways.







Abstract
Electron harvesting bacteria are key targets to develop microbial electrosynthesis technologies, which are valid alternatives for the production of value&#8208;added compounds without utilization of fossil fuels. Geobacter sulfurreducens, that is capable of donating and accepting electrons from electrodes, is one of the most promising electroactive bacteria. Its electron transfer mechanisms to electrodes have been progressively elucidated, however the electron harvesting pathways are still poorly understood. Previous studies showed that the periplasmic cytochromes PccH and GSU2515 are overexpressed in current&#8208;consuming G. sulfurreducens biofilms. PccH was characterized, though no putative partners have been identified. In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low&#8208;spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N&#8208;terminal region and an &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox&#8208;linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligands in the reduced and oxidized states, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and modulated by the pH in the physiological range: &#8722;78&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;6 and &#8722;113&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;7. Such pH&#8208;dependence coupled to the redox&#8208;linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain. Biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments indicated that GSU2515 and PccH form a redox complex. Overall, the data obtained highlight for the first time how periplasmic proteins bridge the electron transfer between the outer and inner membrane in the electron harvesting pathways of G. sulfurreducens.

From amine to imine more easily: A fan&#8208;like hollow N&#8208;doped C&#8208;coated AgCl/Pd heterostructure has been synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor under argon. The interface effect of the AgCl/Pd heterostructure efficiently regulates the electronic structure and accelerates the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, leading to excellent photocatalytic activity toward oxidative coupling of amine to imine.







Abstract
Rationally designing interface structure to modulate the electronic structure of a photocatalyst is an efficient strategy to facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers and improve photocatalytic activity. In this work, a AgCl/Pd heterostructure encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (AgCl/Pd@N&#8722;C) with a fan&#8208;like morphology assembled hollow tubes was synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor. The unique interface structure not only increases the number of photogenerated charge carriers, but also provides an effective channel for the separation of electrons and holes, which have been proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As expected, the obtained AgCl/Pd&#8208;3@N&#8722;C exhibited greatly enhanced conversion efficiency and recyclability toward the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amine under blue&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Terpyridine Diphosphine Ruthenium Complexes as Efficient Photocatalysts for the Transfer Hydrogenation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new cationic ruthenium [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]X (X=Cl, PF6) complexes, prepared from [RuCl2(PPh3)3] a diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy), promote the photocatalytical transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds in 2&#8208;propanol under mild conditions. Unprecedented asymmetric catalytic TH of acetophenone driven by light was obtained with ruthenium tpy complexes containing the chiral Skewphos diphosphine.







Abstract
The cationic achiral and chiral terpyridine diphosphine ruthenium complexes [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]Cl (PP=dppp (1), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3)) are easily obtained in 85&#8211;88&#8201;% yield through a one&#8208;pot synthesis from [RuCl2(PPh3)3], the diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) in 1&#8208;butanol. Treatment of 1&#8211;3 with NaPF6 in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=dppp (1&#8201;a), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2&#8201;a) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3&#8201;a)). Reaction of [RuCl2(PPh3)3] with (S,R)&#8208;Josiphos or (R)&#8208;BINAP in toluene, followed by treatment with tpy in 1&#8208;butanol and finally with NaPF6 in MeOH gives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=(S,R)&#8208;Josiphos (4&#8201;a), (R)&#8208;BINAP (5&#8201;a)) isolated in 78&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% yield, respectively. The chiral derivatives have been isolated as single stereoisomers and 3&#8201;a, 4&#8201;a have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The tpy complexes with NaOiPr display high photocatalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds using 2&#8208;propanol as the only hydrogen donor and visible light at 30&#8201;&#176;C, at remarkably high S/C (up to 5000) and TOF values up to 264&#8197;h&#8722;1. The chiral enantiomers 2, 2&#8201;a and 3, 3&#8201;a induce the asymmetric photocatalytic TH of acetophenone, affording (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol with 51 and 52&#8201;% ee, respectively, in a MeOH/2&#8208;propanol mixture.

         <title>A Rapid Access to&#160;Chiral and&#160;Tripodal Cavitands from&#160;&#946;&#8208;Pinene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoenone,  &#160;  obtained from monoterpene&#160;  b  &#8208; pinene, into an enantiopure cyclotrimer. This  &#160;C  3  &#160;symmetric compound has three bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane rings fused to its central benzene with each ring carrying a carbonyl group. The cyclotrimer undergoes diastereoselective threefold alkynylation with lithium salts of five terminal alkynes (41&#8208;63%,&#160;  de  % = 4&#8208;83). The addition enabled a rapid synthesis of a small library of novel chiral cavitands that in shape resemble a tripod stand. These molecular tripods include a&#160;  tris  &#8208;bicycloannelated benzene head attached to three alkyne legs twisted in one direction to form a nonpolar cavity with polar groups as feet. Tripods with methylpyridinium and methylisoquinolinium legs, respectively, form inclusion complexes with anti&#8208;inflammatory and chiral drugs (  R  )/(  S  )&#8208;ibuprofen and (  R  )/(  S  )&#8208;naproxen. The mode of binding shows drug molecules docked in the cavity of the host via ion&#8208;ion, cation &#8208;p , and C&#8208;H &#8208;p &#160;contacts that, in addition of desolvation, give rise to complexes having mM to&#160; m M stability in water. Our findings open the door for creating a myriad of enantiopure tripods with tunable functions that, in the future, may give novel chemosensors, catalysts or sequestering agents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A silicon&#8208;stereogenic aminosilanol was isolated in excellent diastereomeric ratio and the absolute configuration was determined. The silanol is configurative and condensation stable in solution and shows stereoselective transformations with a clean stereospecific pathway in follow&#8208;up reactions, which leads to the isolation of a silicon&#8208;stereogenic zinc complex and siloxane compounds. Investigations with  18  O&#8208;labelled water and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an otherwise hidden exchange of oxygen atoms of silanol and water in solution that proceeds with retention of the configuration at the silicon center. This novel combination of a stereochemical probe and isotopic labeling in a silicon&#8208;stereogenic compound opens new analytic possibilities to study stereochemical courses of reactions with the aid of chiral silanols mechanistically.</dc:description>

Computational insights on reactivity: The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;H bond hydroxylation is investigated using DFT calculations. The computed mechanism involves a dinuclear side&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxo dicopper(II) adduct in equilibrium with the key oxidizing intermediate bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper(III) species. The difference of reactivity towards internal substrates bearing activated or non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is rationalized.







Abstract
The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8722;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8722;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (L1) or non&#8208;activated (L2) C&#8722;H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a side&#8208;on peroxide species (P) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;oxo) isomer (O) responsible for the C&#8722;H activation step. The P/O equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes. However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C&#8722;H activation step, where the complex bearing the non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Inert Arenes using a Photochemically Activated Guanidinato&#8208;Magnesium(I) Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical approach. Activations of arene C&#8722;H bonds by a photochemically excited dimagnesium(I) compound are reported (see picture, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Experimental and theoretical evidence for the intermediacy of magnesium radicals in these reactions is presented. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H bond activations hold considerable potential for organic synthesis.







Abstract
UV irradiation of solutions of a guanidinate coordinated dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(Priso)Mg}2] 3 (Priso=[(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in either benzene, toluene, the three isomers of xylene, or mesitylene, leads to facile activation of an aromatic C&#8722;H bond of the solvent in all cases, and formation of aryl/hydride bridged magnesium(II) products, [{(Priso)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;Ar)] 4&#8211;9. In contrast to similar reactions reported for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate coordinated counterparts of 3, these C&#8722;H activations proceed with little regioselectivity, though they are considerably faster. Reaction of 3 with an excess of the pyridine, p&#8208;NC5H4But (pyBut), gave [(Priso)Mg(pyButH)(pyBut)2] 10, presumably via reduction of the pyridine to yield a radical intermediate, [(Priso)Mg(pyBut&#8901;)(pyBut)2] 11, which then abstracts a proton from the reaction solvent or a reactant. DFT calculations suggest two possible pathways to the observed arene C&#8722;H activations. One of these involves photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Mg bond of 3, generating magnesium(I) doublet radicals, (Priso)Mg&#8901;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange via C&#8722;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species includes the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of 3 leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H activation process and formation of an alkyl&#8208;bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(&#956;&#8208;Priso&#8722;H)}2] 12. Furthermore, irradiation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 3 and the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] (DipNacnac=[HC(MeCNDip)2]&#8722;), effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the near quantitative formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8722;Mg(DipNacnac)] 13. Finally, the EPR spectrum (77&#8197;K) of a glassed solution of UV irradiated 3 is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a doublet radical species.

         <title>Borate Buffer as a Key Player in Cu&#8208;Based Homogeneous Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO33&#8722; anion from borate buffer provides a structural bridge between low&#8208;cost Cu complexes to form a new in situ trinuclear complex as a fast electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation; likewise, the borate species from the buffer solution at pH&#8197;9 facilitate the high turnover frequency (TOF) by playing a significant role in the O&#8208;O bond formation step.







Abstract
Borate buffer was found to have both structural and functional roles within a low&#8208;cost tri&#8208;copper electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation that exhibits a high turnover frequency of 310&#8197;s&#8722;1. The borate buffer was shown to facilitate the catalytic activity by both bridging the three Cu ions and participating in O&#8722;O bond formation. Phosphate and acetate buffers did not show such roles, making borate a unique player in this catalytic system.

         <title>Monomeric Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene and Alkyne Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From traditional to sustainable: Catalysts with platinum&#8208;group metals are well&#8208;established in the field of hydroboration of C&#8722;C multiple bonds. However, the current mantra in catalysis is to employ &#8220;cheap metals for noble tasks&#8221;. In this regard, we have developed a bis(phosphino)carbazolido magnesium&#8208;methyl complex as a catalyst for the hydroboration of alkenes, alkynes, and biologically essential terpenes by using pinacolborane (HBpin) as a hydride donor. More information can be found in the Research Article by R.&#8197;G. Gonnade, D. Koley, S.&#8197;S. Sen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201896).

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Allyl Boronates and Silanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates is disclosed. Through the electrogeneration of boryl and silyl radical a panel of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes was converted into the corresponding allyl silanes and boronates in good to excellent yields (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). A scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased and the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates was disclosed. The addition of electrogenerated boryl or silyl radicals onto many &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a large panel of synthetically useful gem&#8208;difluoro and &#947;&#8208;fluoroallyl boronates and silanes (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). In addition, a scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased using an electrochemical reactor with promising volumetric productivity (688&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1 and 496&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1). Moreover, the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations. Finally, plausible reaction mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of the products.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways to detect some of these sites with the help of double&#8208;resonance techniques. These sequences ported the signatures of dilute, low&#8208;g nuclei onto the abundant water 1H signal through the spontaneous exchanges that labile OH and NH protons undergo with H2O. These effects provide new routes in molecular NMR imaging.







Abstract
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways of detecting some of these sites with the help of proton&#8208;detected double resonance techniques. As standard coherence transfer methods are of limited use for such indirect detection, alternative routes for probing the quadrupolar spectra on 1H were tested. These centered on modulating the broadening effects imparted onto protons adjacent to the low&#8208;&#947; species through J couplings through either continuous wave or spin&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance decoupling/recoupling sequences. As in all cases, the changes imparted by these double&#8208;resonance strategies were small due to the fast relaxation undergone by the quadrupoles, the sensitivity of these approaches was amplified by transferring their effects onto the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications were mediated by the spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons. In experiments designed on the basis of double&#8208;resonance spin echoes, these enhancements were imparted by looping the transverse encodings together with multiple longitudinal storage periods, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with exchange (D&#8208;REX) sequences. In experiments designed on the basis of continuous on/off quadrupolar decoupling, these solvent exchanges were incorporated into chemical&#8208;exchange saturation transfer schemes, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with saturation transfer (D&#8208;REST) sequences. Both of these variants harnessed sizable proportions of the easily detectable water signals, in order to characterize the NMR spectra and/or to image with atomic&#8208;site specificity the 17O and 14N species.

         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries (PALBs) are widely attracting researchers because they can directly convert solar energy into electric energy for storage or output without any intermediate. Highly active photogenerated carriers can enhance the battery reaction and reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process to increase the energy efficiency. The development of various PALBs is discussed under the aspects of configuration, mechanism, electrodes design and performance.







Abstract
The application of solar energy is crucial for alleviating the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development. In recent years, photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable batteries have attracted researchers because they can directly convert and store solar energy in the batteries. And it also can be used like a normal battery without light illumination. Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries have received more attention than other energy storage systems due to their higher energy density and relatively mature development. This Review focuses on the design of various photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries including Li&#8208;ion, Li&#8208;S, Li&#8208;O2, Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;I batteries, as well as the working mechanism of photoelectrodes in these battery systems. The basic understanding and challenge of photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. At last, perspectives for the photoelectrode development are provided in the summary to advance photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.

An excellent 2D photocatalyst was synthesized by loading Au nanoparticles and CdS quantum dots on niobate nanosheets. This CdS/Au/HNb3O8 photocatalyst not only increased the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate by 254 times compared with the pure niobate nanosheet, but also showed outstanding photocatalytic performance for oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine and degradation of organic dyes.







Abstract
Niobate nanosheets have aroused widespread interest in recent years for their prospects in catalysis. The exploration of 2D niobate catalysis with stable and efficient properties is still the focus in chemistry and materials science. Herein, the successful fabrication of 2D CdS/Au/HNb3O8 catalyst is demonstrated which revealed efficient photocatalytic properties in H2 evolution, oxidative self&#8208;coupling of amines to imines, and degradation of dyes. Especially the assembled architecture can give a rate of 5.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 of photocatalytic H2 evolution, an &#8764;254&#8208;fold enhancement, compared with bare HNb3O8 nanosheets under identical conditions. In accordance with density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, the vast improvements are benefited from efficient migration and separation of charge carriers. Besides, the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs enhances the light harvesting capacity and boosts the generation of hot electrons, efficiently improving the visible&#8208;light absorption.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained with the same topology by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity: the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability.







Abstract
In this work, the two example rare earth&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LaIII&#8208;based MOFs), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, with the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB being 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C and that of Gd&#8208;ETTB being 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than for most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiments and continuous work tests showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiments showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed the hydrogen&#8208;bond network's being rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and thus optimizing the channels for proton transfer explained the MOF's high performance.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Mono&#8208; vs. Di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of mono&#8208; and double&#8208;arylated products at ortho position was feasible via the pyrazolone directing group. The selectivity of the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction was controlled by the temperature and derived from the structure of the used directing group. This allowed the achievement of unsymmetrical double&#8208;substituted arylated products in a one&#8208;pot procedure. Ortho&#8208;arylated pyrazolones underwent unusual decarboxylative cleavage under relatively mild conditions to form hydrazones.







Abstract
A method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation assisted with a 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylpyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;on directing group, selectively providing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylated products is reported. Steric hindrance appearing between the directing group and the already introduced aryl substituent enables control of mono&#8208; vs. diarylation selectivity by the temperature of the reaction. Taking advantage of this, a series of monosubstituted and disubstituted derivatives were obtained in good yields. Moreover, unsymmetrical double&#8208;arylation in a one&#8208;pot procedure was developed to give corresponding products in reasonable yields. Additionally, synthesis and X&#8208;ray study of intermediate palladium metallacycles of both, the first and second arylation reactions, were conducted. X&#8208;ray structure comparison emphasizes the geometrical differences that were consistent with the observed reactivity. Finally, decarboxylative cleavage of the pyrazolone directing group under mild conditions gave synthetically useful hydrazones. The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such ortho arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.

         <title>Leveraging Metal and Ligand Reactive Sites for One Pot Reactions: Ligand&#8208;Centered Borenium Ions for Tandem Catalysis with Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;containing diphosphorous ligands are reported that are capable of tandem cycloaddition and cross&#8208;coupling catalysis using separate reactive sites on the metal and ligand.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts that perform two different organic transformations in a single pot are highly desirable because they enable rapid and efficient assembly of simple organic building blocks into more complex molecules. Many examples of tandem catalysis rely on metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving one or more metal complexes. Remarkably, despite surging interest in the development of chemically reactive (i.&#8201;e., non&#8208;innocent) ligands, there are few examples of metal complexes that leverage ligand&#8208;centered reactivity to perform catalytic reactions in tandem with separate catalytic reactions at the metal. Here we report how multifunctional Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;derived diphosphorus ligands, called TBDPhos, appear to facilitate borenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reactions at the ligand, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions at the metal. Both transformations can be accessed in one pot to afford rare examples of tandem catalysis using separate metal and ligand catalysis sites in a single complex.

         <title>Insights into the Effect of the Adsorption Preference of Additives on the Anisotropic Growth of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encouraging growth &#8211; more or less: The adsorption preference of eight additives and their role in the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Either an inhibition or a promotion effect is revealed by these additives. A descriptor related to the adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was employed to estimate the ZSM&#8208;5 morphology, which varied from sphere&#8208;like to plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like.







Abstract
Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role in affecting catalytic performance, while is persistently challenging to tailor through crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced into the synthesis of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, however their role and the underlying mechanism are not well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either an inhibition effect or a promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites varying from sphere&#8208;like, plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role in affecting catalytic performance, while is persistently challenging to tailor through crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced into the synthesis of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, however their role and the underlying mechanism are not well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of the ZSM-5 zeolite is unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either an inhibition effect or a promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM-5 zeolites varying from sphere-like, plate-like to noodle-like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Enjoying the sun: The cover illustrates the potential of heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes to facilitate the P arylation of H&#8208;phosphonates with diazonium salts, while visible light kicks off the dual gold and photoredox catalytic cycle. The underlying structure of the catalysts&#8217; coordinating ligand system is accessible by a novel postfunctionalization approach, and the stereochemistry can be controlled by the order of metal coordination and click reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Breher and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201856).

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BPh3 and PhSiH3, represented as the stars Hikoboshi and Orihime, constitute a powerful catalytic system for deoxygenative CO2 conversions. According to a Japanese legend, this couple were banished to opposite sides of the Milky Way only coming together once a year. When BPh3 and PhSiH3 come together as catalyst and reductant, N&#8208;methylaniline undergoes N&#8208;methylation at room temperature under CO2 and under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The catalytic mechanism was studied by NMR measurements and DFT calculations, both of which strongly suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722; as a key catalytic species. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;y. Hasegawa, T. Ema, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202210).

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating bacteria extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Reversible Solvent Uptake in&#160;Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic behaviour of Supramolecular Organic Frameworks (SOFs) based on the rigid tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane ( TPPM) organic tecton has been elucidated through 3D Electron Diffraction, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The SOF undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to vapors of selected organic solvents, moving from a closed structure with isolated small voids to an expanded structure with solvated channel along the b axis. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOF, following the degree of packing coefficient. The effect of solvent uptake on TPPM solid&#8208;state fluorescence was investigated, evidencing a significant variation in the emission profile only in the presence of chloroform.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Stereogenic Primary Aminophosphine Sulfides under Reductive Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereochemically pure phosphines with phosphorus&#8211;heteroatom bonds and  P&#8208;centered chirality are a promising class of functional building blocks for the design of chiral ligands and organocatalysts. A route to enantiomerically pure primary aminophosphine sulfides was opened through stereospecific reductive C&#8211;N bond cleavage of phosphorus(V) precursors by lithium in liquid ammonia. The chemoselectivity of the reaction as a function of reaction time, substrate pattern, and chiral auxiliary was investigated. In the presence of exclusively aliphatic groups bound to the phosphorus atom, all competing reductive side reactions are totally prevented. The absolute configurations of all  P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their use as synthetic building blocks was demonstrated. The lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;dithiophosphoric acid proved to be a useful stereochemical probe to determine the enantiomeric purity. Insights into the coordination mode of the lithium&#8208;based chiral complex formed in solution was provided by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Organocatalysts &#8211; Singly&#8208;linked and Macrocyclic Bisphosphoric Acids for Asymmetric Phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The linking of phosphoric acids via covalent or mechanical bonds has proven to be a successful strategy for the design of novel organocatalysts. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, including their synthesis and their application in phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We found that the novel bisphosphoric acids show dramatically increased enantioselectivities in comparison to their &#160;monophosphoric acid analogues. However, the nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence on the enantioselectivities. In the asymmetric dearomative fluorination via phase&#8208;transfer catalysis, bisphosphoric acids with a single, rigid bisalkyne&#8208;linker give the best results with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. In contrast, bisphosphoric acids with flexible linkers give excellent enantioselectivities in the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation of quinolines via cooperative Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT&#8208;calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Functionalized Cyanopyridines Yield an Extremely Low&#8208;Reduction&#8208;Potential Anolyte for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanopyridines and cyanophenylpyridines were investigated as anolytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2 V or lower vs ferrocene  +/0  , but the 3&#8208;CNPy  &#8226;&#8208;  radical anion forms a sigma&#8208;dimer that is re&#8208;oxidized at  E  &#8776; &#8722;1.1 V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge&#8208;discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50 M [NBu  4  ][PF  6  ] shows that 2&#8208;CNPy and 4&#8208;CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that adding a phenyl group to the cyanopyridines would, for some isomers, limit dimerization and improve the stability of the radical anions, while shifting their  E  1/2  only about +0.10 V relative to the parent cyanopyridines. Among the cyanophenylpyridines, 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy and 3&#8208;CN&#8208;4&#8208;PhPy are the most promising as anolytes. They exhibit reversible reductions at  E  1/2  = &#8722;2.19 and &#8722;2.22 V vs ferrocene  +/0  (Fc  +/0  ), respectively, and retain about half of their capacity after 30 bulk charge&#8208;discharge cycles. An improved version of 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy with three methyl groups (3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)pyridine) has an extremely low reduction potential of &#8211;2.50 V vs Fc  +/0  (the lowest reported for a nonaqueous RFB anolyte) and loses only 0.21% of capacity per cycle during charge&#8208;discharge cycling in acetonitrile.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereodivergent Approach to the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel designed stereodivergent strategy for the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropnes. The reaction provides a highly modular approach to prepare cyclopropane ring variants bearing gem(Bpin,Bpin), gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bdan), and gem&#8208;(Bpin,BF3K), with outstanding levels of stereocontrol. This was achieved by diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes with &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;trifluoromethyl. The key to the success of this general protocol was the diastereoselective trifluorination reaction of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes, followed by the stereospecific interconversion of the trifluoroborate salts into the Bdan group.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Glycans to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein, an Open Question: NMR Data on Binding Site Localization, Affinity, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have used NMR experiments to explore binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV&#8209;2 spike glycoprotein (S&#8209;protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm binding of sialoglycans to the S&#8209;protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the mM range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S&#8209;protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S&#8208;protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916; 143&#8208;145 of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein, supporting localization of the binding site in the N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8209;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8209;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using  1  H,  15  N TROSY HSQC based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments we exclude binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8209;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan&#8208;binding to the S&#8208;protein.</dc:description>

The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8209;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8209;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using  1  H,  15  N TROSY HSQC based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments we exclude binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8209;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan-binding to the S-protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Nodes of Metal Organic Frameworks can Activate Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation of multiple bonds are among the most general and important organic reactions. Typical heterogeneous catalysts are based on transition metal nanoparticles, including noble metals. Data are presented here showing that metal nodes of MIL&#8208;101 and UiO&#8208;66 in the absence of occluded metal nanoparticles can promote hydrogenation of polarized X=Y double bonds of nitro groups and carbonyl. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes afford an efficient route to either polysubstituted naphthols or aryl&#8208;substituted furans. Owing to the unique dichotomy of gold&#8208;carbenes, this protocol provides a switchable reaction selectivity between naphthols and furans enabled by the use of TFP&#8208;Au(MeCN)SbF6 (tri(2&#8208;furyl) phosphine) or PNP(AuNTf2)2&#65288;bis(diphenylphosphino)(isopropyl) amine) as catalysts respectively.

         <title>A Chemotactic Colloidal Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemotactic colloidal motors can be served as excellent physical models of non&#8208;equilibrium complex systems and also have potential in active target delivery and other biomedical applications. In this Concept, both the recent experimental progress and theoretical opinion of chemotactic motors based on the torque&#8208;driven self&#8208;reorientation and alignment mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in the realization of various functions of human life such as fertilization, immune function, inflammatory response, regeneration processes, etc. Inspired by the natural chemotaxis, colloidal motors with chemotactic ability can realize intelligent sense and targeted navigation, which bring a revolutionary method to biomedical applications like precision medicine. However, the application in the biomedical field requires the colloidal motors with submicrometer scale, strong chemotactic ability and clear chemotactic mechanism. In this Concept article, we introduce the recent progress of chemotactic colloidal motors, covering the fundamental theory behind experimental advancements. Particularly, the torque&#8208;driven reorientation motion of the submicrometer&#8208;sized colloidal motors during chemotaxis is discussed, and also their underlying mechanism is proposed. With the continuous research on chemotactic colloidal motors, it is believed that the emerging chemotactic colloidal motors will broaden practical applications in the biomedical field.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What shape are you in? The structure of amorphous TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O has been determined from DFT calculations and EXAFS measurements. Contrary to the generally accepted model, TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O forms zigzag chains of cis&#8208;Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)4(H2O)2 units. A slow aging process results in increasing polymerization that might eventually lead to a new TcO2 polymorph. Formation of these phases with low solubility is highly relevant for the confinement of long&#8208;lived 99Tc in deep nuclear waste repositories.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;emitting 99Tc isotope is a high&#8208;yield fission product in 235U and 239Pu nuclear reactors, raising special concern in nuclear waste management due to its long half&#8208;life and the high mobility of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;). Under the conditions of deep nuclear waste repositories, Tc is retained through biotic and abiotic reduction of TcO4&#8722; to compounds like amorphous TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O precipitates. It is generally accepted that these precipitates have linear (Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)2(H2O)2)n chains, with trans H2O. Although corresponding Tc&#8722;Tc and Tc&#8722;O distances have been obtained from extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, this structure is largely based on analogy with other compounds. Here, we combine density&#8208;functional theory with EXAFS measurements of fresh and aged samples to show that, instead, TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O forms zigzag chains that undergo a slow aging process whereby they combine to form longer chains and, later, a tridimensional structure that might lead to a new TcO2 polymorph.

         <title>Detection of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species by Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobes: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) is of great significance. A variety of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nanoprobes for ROS and RNS detection is reviewed. Our focus is to describe how they are built and how do they work. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges for UCNPs&#8208;based NIR nanoprobes are briefly discussed, and how to improve the performance of UCNPs is also prospected.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are essential oxidative metabolites of organisms, which are closely related to physiological, pathological and pharmacological processes. The accurate detection of ROS/RNS is important for the understanding of biological processes, monitoring of pharmacological effects, and predicting the course of disease. The recently developed NIR nanoprobes based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) hold great prospects in sensitive and deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS/RNS, and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In this review, we systematically summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances of UCNPs&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probes for ROS/RNS sensing, and the potential challenges and perspectives for further research are also highlighted. We envision that such a research field will have a bright future for modern biomedical applications.

         <title>YfeX &#8211; A New Platform for Carbene Transferase Development with High Intrinsic Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases. WT YfeX catalyzes N&#8722;H insertion (including aliphatic and secondary amines) in high yield, cyclopropanation, and most excitingly, Si&#8722;H insertion of dimethylphenylsilane. QM/MM calculations reveal details of the mechanism of the unusual Si&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
Carbene transfer biocatalysis has evolved from basic science to an area with vast potential for the development of new industrial processes. In this study, we show that YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases, due to its high intrinsic reactivity, especially for the N&#8722;H insertion reaction of aromatic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. YfeX shows high stability against organic solvents (methanol and DMSO), greatly improving turnover of hydrophobic substrates. Interestingly, in styrene cyclopropanation, WT YfeX naturally shows high enantioselectivity, generating the trans product with 87&#8201;% selectivity for the (R,R) enantiomer. WT YfeX also catalyzes the Si&#8722;H insertion efficiently. Steric effects in the active site were further explored using the R232A variant. Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) calculations reveal details on the mechanism of Si&#8722;H insertion. YfeX, and potentially other peroxidases, are exciting new targets for the development of improved carbene transferases.

         <title>Self&#8208;repairable and flexible polymer network electrolyte with enhanced lithium ion conduction for lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance functional polymer&#8208;based electrolytes is important for realizing next generation safe lithium metal batteries. In this study, a new type of quasi&#8208;solid polymer network electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) was prepared by combining synthesized polymer network (SIPH) containing urethane bond linked ionic liquids (ILs), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and disulfide bond moieties, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), and glyme type additive. It was found that SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% was mechanically flexible, self&#8208;healable, and showed high ionic conductivity of 2.67&#215;10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  . Also, SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% owned high lithium ion transference number of 0.43 and good electrochemical stability. These properties enabled the SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% electrolyte membrane to support Li/Li symmetrical cell to cycle stably during long term Li plating and stripping. The Li/SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40%/LFP showed high delivered specific capacity and good stability (166.1 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 106 cycles at 0.2 C). Such glyme doped polymer network electrolyte provides new experimental findings for developing polymer&#8208;based electrolyte with excellent mechanical integrity and battery related properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysics of Anionic Bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, the photophysical behavior of four panchromatically absorbing, homoleptic bis(4  H  &#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes, with a systematic variation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the imidazolate ligand, were studied by wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Excitation at 400, 480, and 630 nm populates metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer, intra&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer as well as mixed character singlet states. The pump wavelength&#8208;dependent transient absorption data are analyzed by a recently established 2D correlation approach. The data analysis reveals that all excitation conditions yield similar excited state dynamics. Key to the excited&#8208;state relaxation is fast, subpicosecond pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, which is accompanied by re&#8208;localization of electron density onto a single ligand from the initially delocalized state at Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. The subsequent intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold is followed by a sub&#8208;100 ps decay to the ground state. The fast, non&#8208;radiative decay is rationalized by the low triplet state energy as found by DFT calculations, which suggest the perspective treatment in the strong coupling limit of the energy &#8232;gap law.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Liquid Crystal Dimers Bridged with a Phosphonic Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal (LC) dimers with well&#8208;defined composition and structure arouse broad attentions for their exhibiting LC properties beyond conventional low molar mass mesogens and serving as fascinating model compounds for LC polymers. Here in this work, a series of LC dimers bridged with a phosphonic group have been synthesized through a facile free radical mediated addition reaction between hypophosphorous acid and vinyl terminated cyanobiphenyl mesogens with variant length alkyl spacers. In addition, two esterified derivatives and a group of mono&#8208;addition homologues with a terminal phosphonic acid group have also been prepared for comparison study. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit monotropic nematic (N) phase with typical schlieren textures except for the LC dimer with the longest eleven&#8208;methylene spacer, which surprisingly shows twist&#8208;bend nematic (N  TB  ) phase directly from the isotropic state upon cooling. Moreover, the thermal transition properties such as the nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and associated entropy changes of the series LC dimers display a modest odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, both the LC dimers and the mono&#8208;addition homologues in N phase are quite easy to achieve homeotropic alignment upon annealing thanks to the supramolecular interactions between the introduced phosphonic acid group and the hydroxylated glass surface. This work thus provides a novel synthesis strategy for a class of LC materials bridged with a phosphonic acid group prone to further functionalization, which may serve as promising vertical alignment agents and pave the way for developing a new kind of functionalized LC materials of N  TB  phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Urease by Hydroquinones: A Structural and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into a flap: Hydroquinones inhibit urease by covalently binding to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. The inhibition occurs through an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Hydroquinones are a class of organic compounds abundant in nature that result from the full reduction of the corresponding quinones. Quinones are known to efficiently inhibit urease, a NiII&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonate and acts as a virulence factor of several human pathogens, in addition to decreasing the efficiency of soil organic nitrogen fertilization. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the inhibition of urease from Sporosarcina pasteurii (SPU) and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean, JBU) by 1,4&#8208;hydroquinone (HQ) and its methyl and tert&#8208;butyl derivatives. The 1.63&#8208;&#197; resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the SPU&#8208;HQ complex discloses that HQ covalently binds to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. Inhibition kinetic data obtained for the three compounds on JBU reveals the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>The Sulfur Rich Fluorothiophosphate Dianions [S5P2F2]2&#8722; and [S3PF]2&#8722; : Cluster and Chelation Control of P&#8208;S Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of difluoropentathiophosphate to d10 metals results in either simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination or P&#8722;S heterolysis and capping of fluorotrithiophosphate in trinuclear and octanuclear cadmium and copper clusters. These new complexes may see use as metallothionein mimicks or in capping of CdS semiconductors.







Abstract
The sulfur rich difluoropentathiodiphosphate dianion [S5P2F2]2&#8722;, from fluoride addition to P4S10, has a somewhat checkered history and proves to be the main product of the reaction in acetonitrile. Its optimized synthesis, and structural characterization, as either a tetraphenylphosphonium or a tetrapropylammonium salt, [NnPr4]2[S5P2F2] allows for the first coordination chemistry for this dianion. Reactions of [S5P2F2]2&#8722; with d10 metal ions of zinc(II), and cadmium(II), and d9 copper(II) resulted in a surprising diverse array of binding modes and structural motifs. In addition to the simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination of [S5P2F2]2&#8722; with zinc, cleavage of the P&#8722;S bond resulted in complexes with the unusual [S3PF]2&#8722; fluorotrithiophosphate dianion. This was observed in two cluster complexes: a trinuclear cadmium complex with mixed [S5P2F2]2&#8722;/[S3PF]2&#8722; ligands, [Cd3(S5P2F2)3(S3PF)2]4&#8722; as well as an octanuclear copper cluster, [Cu8(S3PF)6]4&#8722; which form rapidly at room temperature. These new metal/sulfur/ligand clusters are of relevance to understanding multimetal binding to metallothionines, and to potential capping strategies for the condensed nanoparticulate cadmium chalcogenide semiconductors CdS and CdSe.

         <title>Evidence for multiple binding modes in the initial contact between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and cell surface glycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infection of host cells by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 begins with recognition by the virus S (spike) protein of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), tethering the virus to the extracellular matrix environment, and causing the subunit S1&#8208;RBD to undergo a conformational change into the &#8216;open&#8217; conformation. These two events promote the binding of S1&#8208;RBD to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a preliminary step toward viral&#8208;cell membrane fusion. Combining ligand&#8208;based NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics, oligosaccharide analogues were used to explore the interactions between S1&#8208;RBD of SARS CoV&#8208;2 and HS, revealing several low&#8208;specificity binding modes and previously unidentified potential sites for the binding of extended HS polysaccharide chains. The evidence for multiple binding modes also suggest that highly specific inhibitors will not be optimal against protein S but, rather, diverse HS&#8208;based structures, characterized by high affinity and including multi&#8208;valent compounds, may be required.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches (PTS)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a quaterthiophene and sexithiophene that can reversibly change their effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation length  via  photoexcitation. The reported compounds make use of light&#8208;responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker&#8208;assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350 nm light the azobenzene undergoes  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  isomerization mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformations (extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Exposure to 254 nm wavelenght promotes azobenzene  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  thermal relaxation with rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized using steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis, X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical modelling. Finally, we tested the proposed light&#8208;responsive oligothiophenes into field&#8208;effect transistors to probe the photo&#8208;induced tuning of their electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo): Broad&#8208;Range Wavelength&#8208;Independent Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wavelength&#8208;independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We disclosed that the  Z&#8211;E  photoisomerization of the meta&#8208;bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength&#8208;independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic nitrene transfer by an FeIV imido complex generated by a comproportionation process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrene transfer reactions have emerged among the most powerful and versatile ways to insert an amine function to various kinds of hydrocarbon substrates. However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from Fe  II  and Fe  III  precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous vs ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, an Fe  IV  tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the Fe  II  precursor was expected by a two&#8208;electron oxidative addition, its formation from a Fe  III  precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the Fe  III  precursor, an Fe  III  tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an Fe  V  tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active Fe  IV  tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the Fe  III  precursor.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrocatalysis is the most promising strategy to generate clean energy H2  , and the development of catalysts with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at high current density that can resist strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte environment is great significance for practical industrial application. Therefore, a P doped MoS2@Ni3S2  &#160;nanorods array (named P&#8208;NiMoS) was successfully synthesized through successive sulfuration and phosphorization, the P&#8208;NiMoS presents core/shell structure with heterojunction between MoS2  (shell)&#160;and Ni3S2  &#160;(core). Furthermore, the doping of P modulates the electronic structure of the P&#8208;NiMoS, the electrons transfer from the t2g  &#160;orbital of Ni element to the eg  &#160;empty orbital of Mo element through Ni&#8208;S&#8208;Mo bond at Ni3S2  &#160;and MoS2  &#160;heterojunction, facilitating hydrogen evolution reaction.&#160;As a result, P&#8208;NiMoS exhibits excellent HER activity, the overpotential is 290 mV at high current density 250 mA cm&#8208;2  &#160;in alkaline electrolyte, which is close to Pt/C (282 mV@250 mA cm&#8208;2  ), and P&#8208;NiMoS can stably evolve hydrogen for 48 h.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report an electrophotochemical dual metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for decarboxylative arylation of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with aryl halides. The relative stabilities of catalytically active metal complexes simultaneously generated at anode and cathode are the key design elements for the success of this convergent paired electrolysis.

         <title>A Porous Polyaromatic Solid for Vapor Adsorption of Xylene with High Efficiency, Selectivity, and Reusability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of porous materials capable of capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene and its derivatives, with high efficiency, selectivity, and reusability is highly demanded. Here we report unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs by a new porous solid, composed of a polyaromatic capsule bearing a spherical nanocavity with subnano&#8208;sized windows. Without prior crystallization and high&#8208;temperature vacuum drying, the porous polyaromatic solids exhibit the following five features: vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90% selectivity, high affinity toward  o  &#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80% selectivity,  ortho  &#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50%) from mixed xylene isomers, tight VOCs storage even under high temperature and vacuum conditions, and at least 5 times reusability for xylene adsorption. The observed adsorption abilities are accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure within 1 h, which has not been demonstrated by organic/inorganic porous materials reported previously.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Achiral Phosphine Ligands on a Synergistic Organo&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an unusual diastereodivergent stereoselective allylation reaction. It consists of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of an organocatalytically generated amino isobenzofulvene, where the diastereoselectivity is controlled by the electronic properties of a monodentate, achiral ligand on palladium. One major diastereoisomer is formed using triarylphosphines substituted with neutral or electron&#8208;donating substituents of the aryl group, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents favor the other diastereoisomer. The diastereoselectivity correlates with the Taft inductive parameter of substituents on the triarylphosphine ligand on palladium. The synergistic reaction involves both a catalytic secondary amine catalyst for the indene&#8208;aldehyde activation and the monodentate phosphine ligands on palladium, affording a highly enantioselective reaction with up to 98% enantiomeric excess. Based on computational investigations, the role of the monodentate phosphine ligand on the diastereoselectivity is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Propeller Chirality in Triaryl Boranes with Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Stabilization of chiral propeller conformations in triaryl compounds is challenging due to generally low racemization barriers. Nonetheless, it was recently found that chiral conformational preferences can be induced to triaryl boranes by incorporating point&#8208;chiral alkylether chains to the aryl blades and subsequently locking the structure with ammonia. A four&#8208;point interaction, that means the cooperative effects of Lewis&#8208;adduct formation and three hydrogen bonds, was proposed as stabilizing mechanism. Herein, we show that three such strong interactions suffice to introduce a preferential propeller handedness. While DFT calculations predict no noteworthy preferences for either P&#8208; or M&#8208;chiral propellers for some of the investigated triarylborane&#8208;amine adducts that were prepared with chiral primary amines, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic characterizations revealed that there is indeed a measurable excess of one propeller handedness. Furthermore, the steric demand of the amine was found to play a key role in the induction process and especially in preventing blade rotations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of the  peri  position of the  bay  chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the  peri  position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BPh3 smoothly catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline with CO2 and PhSiH3. A zwitterionic carbamate, composed of N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2, and BPh3 act as nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce the silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal that are essential for N&#8208;methylation.







Abstract
BPh3 catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of secondary amines and the C&#8208;methylenation (methylene&#8208;bridge formation between aromatic rings) of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or 1&#8208;methylindoles in the presence of CO2 and PhSiH3; these reactions proceed at 30&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In contrast, B(C6F5)3 shows little or no activity. 11B&#8197;NMR spectra suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722;. The detailed mechanism of the BPh3&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline (1) with CO2 and PhSiH3 was studied by using DFT calculations. BPh3 promotes the conversion of two substrates (N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2) into a zwitterionic carbamate to give three&#8208;component species [Ph(Me)(H)N+CO2&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;BPh3]. The carbamate and BPh3 act as the nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce key CO2&#8208;derived species, such as silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal, essential for the N&#8208;methylation of 1. DFT calculations also suggested other mechanisms involving water for the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722; species.

         <title>Thioxanthylium Cations: Highly Reversible Hydrochromic Mate&#8208;rials with Tunable Color and Moisture Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrochromism of thioxanthylium cations/ thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol can be tuned by structural functionalization to offer diverse colors and moisture&#8208;sensitivities. This reversible hydrochromic system is easily activated with organic acid from chemically stable precursors, allowing for possible uses in moisture&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting encryption.







Abstract
Hydrochromic materials, which change color in response to moisture, are highly sought&#8208;after due to some unique applications such as moisture detection, humidity monitoring, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and sweat&#8208;pore mapping. We herein report a new thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ols/thioxanthylium cations hydrochromic system. The hydrochromic thioxanthylium cations can be generated/regenerated by exposing a chemically stable thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The intensely colored thioxanthylium cations can be chemically reverted to the colorless thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol. Interestingly, the conversion between thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol and its cation species was found to be highly reversible in most cases (up to 50 activation&#8208;deactivation cycles). The color and moisture&#8208;sensitivity of thioxanthylium cations were also validated to be tunable via functionalization of the thioxanthene core with different aliphatic and aromatic groups at its 9 or 2,7&#8208;positions. Finally, paper probes were prepared using solution&#8208;immersion and inkjet&#8208;printing techniques to demonstrate the system's potential applications in humidity sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting

         <title>Influence of the Coordinated Transition Metal Ion on Magnetic Relaxation of Lanthanide Based Complexes with Imino Nitroxide Biradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of biradical&#8208;metal complexes have been obtained by using an imino nitroxide biradical. Remarkably one magnetic process is found for the Dy&#8208;biradical compound while the Dy&#8722;Cu&#8208;radical compound exhibits dual relaxation processes which indicates that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a crucial role in magnetic relaxation behavior.







Abstract
In spite of achievement of a lot of Ln&#8208;radical SMMs, how to improve magnetic behavior of Ln&#8208;radical system remains challenging. Here, two series of Ln&#8208;radical complexes have successfully been built using an imino nitroxide biradical, namely, [Ln2(hfac)6(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 1, Tb 2, Dy 3) and [Ln2Cu2(hfac)10(ImPhPyobis)2] (LnIII=Gd 4, Dy 5; hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate and ImPhPyobis=5&#8208;(4&#8208;oxypyridinium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8217;&#8208;oxyl&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene). For these biradical&#8208;metal complexes, two imino nitroxide biradicals bind two Ln(III) ions via their oxygen atoms coming from 4&#8208;oxypyridinium units to produce a binuclear {Ln2O2} unit. Those imino nitroxide groups are free for complexes 1&#8211;3, however one of imino nitroxide groups of the biradical is ligated to the copper(II) ion for complexes 4 and 5. The distinct magnetic relaxation behaviors are observed for two Dy derivatives, as revealed by ac magnetic studies: complex 3 presents one magnetic process with the effective energy barrier(Ueff) of 74.0&#8197;K while complex 5 exhibits dual relaxation processes with Ueff values for the fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;relaxation being 20.2&#8197;K and 30.9&#8197;K, respectively, which implies that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a critical role for magnetic relaxation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes through Intramolecular Chlorine Transfer as a Novel Strategy for Asymmetric Halopalladation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy for enantioselective halopalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been established to build versatile and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones in excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity with good functional&#8208;group compatibility. This strategy provides a novel approach to asymmetric halopalladation and an alternative for synthesizing complex natural products.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of enynes has contributed significantly to the construction of chiral cyclic molecules. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric cyclization involving halopalladation remains an unresolved challenge with the inevitable disturbance of the halide ions. Herein, an intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy is used to accomplish the enantioselective chloropalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This reaction provides a redox&#8208;neutral approach to a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The precisely controlled coordination of palladium with both the in&#8197;situ generated nucleophilic species and the monodentate phosphoramidite ligand is crucial for enantioselectivity.

         <title>Using Macrocyclic G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands to Decipher the Interactions Between Small Molecules and G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Binding: This study aims to add a deeper level of knowledge to the binding interactions between G4&#8208;ligands and G4 DNA to advance the design of improved G4&#8208;ligands. This is achieved by biophysical and physicochemical evaluations complemented by computational studies of both novel and well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
This study aims to deepen the knowledge of the current state of rational G4&#8208;ligand design through the design and synthesis of a novel set of compounds based on indoles, quinolines, and benzofurans and their comparisons with well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands. This resulted in novel synthetic methods and G4&#8208;ligands that bind and stabilize G4 DNA with high selectivity. Furthermore, the study corroborates previous studies on the design of G4&#8208;ligands and adds deeper explanations to why a) macrocycles offer advantages in terms of G4&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity, b) molecular pre&#8208;organization is of key importance in the development of strong novel binders, c) an electron&#8208;deficient aromatic core is essential to engage in strong arene&#8208;arene interactions with the G4&#8208;surface, and d) aliphatic amines can strengthen interactions indirectly through changing the arene electrostatic nature of the compound. Finally, fundamental physicochemical properties of selected G4&#8208;binders are evaluated, underscoring the complexity of aligning the properties required for efficient G4 binding and stabilization with feasible pharmacokinetic properties.

         <title>&#8220;Crystal memory&#8221; Affects the Properties of Peptide Hydrogels &#8211; The Case of the Cyclic Tyr&#8208;Tyr dipeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Peptide self&#8208;assembling: Both, solid&#8208;state form and stereochemistry significantly influence a self&#8208;assembly process of a cyclic dipeptide, Tyr&#8208;Tyr (cYY), leading to a soft matter with different morphology and rheological properties.







Abstract
In this work a relationship between the crystal form and morphology and rheological properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels is examined. We show, that under favorable circumstances a correlation between a starting solid material and a self&#8208;assembly processes in solution can exist, leading to different properties of a resulting soft matter. This observation, together with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the influence of stereochemistry of self&#8208;assembled (ll) and (dl) Tyr&#8208;Tyr cyclic dipeptides (cYY) on the observed relationship between gelation and crystallization allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the peptide hydrogelation processes at a molecular level, using liquid state NMR, rheological studies and scanning electron microscopy. In the course of our studies, several crystal forms of (ll)&#8208;cYY has been discovered and described in details using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as advanced solid state NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction of powders, thermal analysis, FTIR, circular dichroism and crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations. Subsequently, we found that while (ll)&#8208;cYY easily assembles into hydrogels with different properties depending on the starting solid form, (dl)&#8208;cYY always precipitated as one crystal form in the tested conditions. Molecular&#8208;level justification for this observation is given.

         <title>Solar Driven Gas Phase Advanced Oxidation Processes for Methane Removal &#8208; Challenges and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. Developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods is one of the most effective strategies to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions and thus to limit global warming. Challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal are analyzed.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH4 emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5&#8201;&#176;C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions by developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH4 (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methane&lt;/b&gt; (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. Developing large-scale methane removal methods is one of the most effective strategies to reduce rapidly the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and thus to limit global warming. Challenges and prospects of solar-driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; removal are analyzed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5&#8201;&#176;C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by developing large-scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar-driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar-driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of [FeII(Atrz)3]SO4 and its Analogues Through Accelerated Ageing: New Insights from Small&#8208;Scale Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated ageing can be used to synthesize functional materials including spin crossover systems. Reactions proceed between a metal salt and a ligand placed in contact in a humid environment without any solvent or applied energy. Optical microscopy of small&#8208;scale reactions can be used to derive mechanistic information about accelerated ageing.







Abstract
Accelerated ageing reactions that take place between two solid materials on contact in the absence of added solvent have been used to synthesize two spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active 1D coordination polymers and one of their Cu(II) analogues. The hygroscopy of the ligands and the relative humidity of the reaction chamber have been shown to be particularly important factors in the rate of reaction. Small&#8208;scale reactions between a few individual crystals have allowed observation of deliquescence of the 4&#8208;aminotriazole ligand at high humidity. The metal salt does not dissolve, and the ligand diffuses into the crystal of the metal salt during the reaction. In the case of the Cu analogue, the formation of the product causes the crystal of the metal salt to deform with the formation of pseudocrystals, which have a fibrous structure.

         <title>Design of a Photocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition Reaction Using Redox&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on our Redox&#8208;Tag strategy was developed involving carefully designed substrates which turned out to be effective for the reaction. A radical cation was formed by oxidative single electron transfer (SET) that immediately reacted with an alkene. An aryl radical cation was generated by intramolecular SET and during the subsequent reductive SET a cyclobutane was formed.







Abstract
The design of photocatalytic processes is important for a sustainable society. Key to these photocatalytic reactions is electron transfer. This article is focused on titanium dioxide photocatalyzed organic synthesis and the design of a new [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on the electron transfer process. Electron transfer &#8208; not only between the substrate and the photocatalyst but also inter&#8208; and intramolecularly &#8211; is crucial for the reaction design. Radical cations were generated by the photocatalyst and trapped by alkenes. The resultant cyclobutyl radical cations were immediately reduced by the aryl rings via intramolecular electron transfer to obtain cyclobutane rings. The outcome of the reaction was controlled by substitution of the aryl ring and the linker connecting the aryl ring to the enol ether. The carefully designed substrates were highly effective for photocatalytic cycloaddition.

         <title>Substituted Cyclopentannulated Tetraazapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bromine substituents into cyclopentannulated tetraazapentacenes allows post&#8208;functionalization, for example through Sonogashira coupling and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun reaction. The altered properties of the resulting new compounds were examined by experimental and computational methods, and the potential use as organic field&#8208;effect transistors was demonstrated.







Abstract
Brominated pentannulated dihydrotetraazapentacenes were prepared by gold&#8208; or palladium&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of TIPS&#8208;ethynylated dihydrotetraazaacenes (TIPS = triisopropylsilyl). Post&#8208;functionalization was demonstrated by Sonogashira alkynylation and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun cyanation. Calculations predict these species to act as n&#8208;type semiconductors, which was verified for two derivates through characterization in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Structural Insights into the Very Low Activity of the Homocoenzyme B12 Adenosylmethylcobalamin in Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase and Ethanolamine Ammonia&#8208;Lyase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray structures of diol dehydratase (DD) and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL) complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) were determined to get insights into the very low activity of AdoMeCbl. The DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that leave DD in the inactive state (left). The EAL active site is rigid and its binding does not induce significant conformational change (right).







Abstract
The X&#8208;ray structures of coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl)&#8208;dependent eliminating isomerases complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) have been determined. As judged from geometries, the Co&#8722;C bond in diol dehydratase (DD) is not activated even in the presence of substrate. In ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL), the bond is elongated in the absence of substrate; in the presence of substrate, the complex likely exists in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;homolysis states. The impacts of incorporating an extra CH2 group are different in the two enzymes: the DD active site is flexible, and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that make DD unable to adopt the catalytic state, whereas the EAL active site is rigid, and AdoMeCbl binding does not induce significant conformational changes. Such flexibility and rigidity of the active sites might reflect the tightness of adenine binding. The structures provide good insights into the basis of the very low activity of AdoMeCbl in these enzymes.

         <title>Cu3(HHTP)2 c&#8208;MOF/ZnO Ultrafast Ultraviolet Photodetector for Wearable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable ultraviolet photodetector based on 2D c&#8208;MOF Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction is fabricated by Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the photodetector shows superior photoresponse and outstanding mechanical durability.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2&#8197;A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1&#8197;V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self&#8208;powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70&#8197;&#956;s, which is the record value for MOF&#8208;based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000&#8208;time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF&#8208;based UV photodetector with anti&#8208;fatigue and anti&#8208;bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wearable ultraviolet photodetector&lt;/b&gt; based on 2D c-MOF Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnO type-II heterojunction is fabricated by Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the photodetector shows superior photoresponse and outstanding mechanical durability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c-MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnO type-II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2&#8197;A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at 1&#8197;V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self-powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70&#8197;&#956;s, which is the record value for MOF-based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000-time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF-based UV photodetector with anti-fatigue and anti-bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sometimes things just gel: Glycoconjugate (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco in which a d&#8208;glucosamine moiety was attached to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus showed hierarchical self&#8208;aggregation leading to the formation of transparent, injectable, and biocompatible hydrogel. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco nanocomposite hydrogel bearing AgNPs can be applied topically as an antibacterial soft material. Solvent&#8208;dependent chiral inversion was demonstrated in the aggregates of a (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco&#8208;bearing l&#8208;leucine unit.







Abstract
We have shown solvent&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent chiral inversion of a few glycoconjugate supramolecules. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco, in which d&#8208;glucosamine has been attached chemically to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus, forms a self&#8208;healing hydrogel through intertwining of the nanofibers wherein the gelators undergo lamellar packing in the &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures with a single chiral handedness. Dihybrid (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco nanocomposite gel was prepared by in&#8208;situ formation of silver nanoparticles AgNPs in the gel; this enhances the mechanical properties of the composite gel through physical crosslinking without altering the packing pattern. In contrast, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco bearing an l&#8208;leucine moiety does not form a hydrogel but an organogel. Interestingly, the chiral handedness of the aggregates of (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco can be reversed by choosing suitable solvents. In addition to self&#8208;healing behavior, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco gel revealed shape persistency. Further, (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel is benign, nontoxic, non&#8208;immunogenic, and non&#8208;allergenic in animal cells. AgNP&#8208;loaded (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel showed antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Coupling Reactions of Dinitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Mediated by Monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722;&#8901;Anions: Carbon&#8722;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions mediated C&#8722;N coupling reactions with inert N2 and CO2 under plasma conditions have been reported. Anionic products NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722; were generated, accompanied by the production of neutral products of YO and YB0&#8211;2NC. This strategy may provide a new approach to realize the N2 and CO2 coupling reactions at room temperature.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed coupling to form C&#8722;N bonds is significant in chemical science. However, the inert nature of N2 and CO2 renders their coupling quite challenging. Herein, we report the activation of dinitrogen in the mild plasma atmosphere by the gas&#8208;phase monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions and further coupling of CO2 to form C&#8722;N bonds by using mass spectrometry and theoretical calculation. The observed product anions are NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722;, accompanied by the formation of neutral products YO and YB0&#8211;2NC, respectively. We can tune the reactivity and the type of products by manipulating the number of B atoms. The B atoms in YB1&#8211;4N2&#8722; act as electron donors in CO2 reduction reactions, and the carbon atom originating from CO2 serves as an electron reservoir. This is the first example of gas&#8208;phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N2 with CO2 through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>The Unprecedented [S4N2O10]2&#8722; Anion in the Molecular Gold Complexes [Au2Br2(S4N2O10)2] and [Au2Cl2(S4N2O10)2](S2O5Cl2)</title>

         <dc:description>
The cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, is reported in dimeric gold complexes for the first time. The anion can be interpreted as the condensation product of two sulfate anions and two amidosulfate anions. The applied solvothermal synthesis between SO3, P3N3Cl6 and metal salts is a promising route to obtain novel nitrogen&#8208;containing sulfates.







Abstract
The reaction of hexachlorophosphazene, P3N3Cl6, with SO3 and the gold halides AuCl3 and AuBr3, respectively, leads to the new cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, which is coordinated to Au3+ in the dimeric complexes [Au2X2(S4N2O10)2] (X=Cl, Br). The [S4N2O10]2&#8722; anion can be seen as the condensation product of two sulfate anions, [SO4]2&#8722;, and two amidosulfate anions, [NH2SO3]&#8722;.
