         <title>Wavelength Dependent Activation of Photoacids and Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids and bases allow remote control over pH in reaction solutions, which is of fundamental importance to an array of applications. Herein, we evaluate the wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength photoreactivity of triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts as a representative photoacid and p&#8208;(benzoyl)benzyl triethylammonium tetraphenylborate as a photobase, constructing a wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemical action plot for each of the compounds. We monitor the pH change of the solution on&#8208;line within the cavity of the laser vial and demonstrate a marked mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the photoacid and base with the photochemical action plot, unveiling reactivity at extremely low absorptivities. Our findings are of critical importance for the use of photoacids and bases, unambiguously demonstrating that absorption is no guide to chemical reactivity with critical consequences for the wavelength employed in applications of photoacids and bases.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enantioselective Aminocatalytic Cascade Reaction Affording Bioactive Hexahydroazulene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalysis opens up for a novel cascade reaction concept where 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines first undergo an enantioselective [6+4] cycloaddition with trienamines, followed by a spontaneously series of reactions to provide chiral hexahydraoazulenes, of which some show bioactivity.







Abstract
A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8722;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), up to 96&#8201;% ee, and yields up to 52&#8201;%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and (Photo)Catalytic Behavior of Ce&#8208;MOFs Containing Perfluoroalkylcarboxylate Linkers: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>

Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer potential for photodegradation of organic dyes in new perfluorinated Ce&#8208;MOFs.







Abstract
Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure. We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8211;3.1&#8197;eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.

         <title>Construction of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) Solid Solutions for Improving Solar Fuels Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by H2O Vapour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a molten&#8208;salt approach to synthesize Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) solid solutions. Expand the light&#8208;harvesting wavelength range. Additionally, we found that with the introduction of ZnFe2O4, the photogenerated electrons transition from CoO4 tetrahedron to FeO6 octahedron, and the FeO6 octahedron becomes the photocatalytic reduction site. The introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.

Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedral active sites in Co&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;2x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indenoannulated Tridecacyclene: An All&#8208;Carbon Seven&#8208;Stage Redox&#8208;Amphoter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenoannulated tridecacyclene, an unprecedented saddle&#8208;shaped non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon, has been synthesized. Under electrochemical conditions, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid subunits in the charged states. Chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the corresponding dication and dianion, which were comprehensively characterized both in experiment and theory.







Abstract
We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Induced Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Tetrathiapyrenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes with thioether linkers exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The peculiar excitation dynamics responsible for the inversion was revealed; the pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures.







Abstract
D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes containing thioether bonds were synthesized. The pyrenophanes exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) while maintaining the emission wavelength and reversibility. The &#916;glum value reached 0.02, and the FL quenching by heat was negligible. The sign inversion of CPL originates from the inversion of intramolecular excimer chirality associated with excitation dynamics. The two pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures. The thioether linkers can impart flexibility suitable for the inversion of chirality of the excimers.

         <title>Control of Kinetic Pathways toward Supramolecular Chiral Polymorphs for Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral and amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 exhibits kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways toward three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct nanomorphologies and chiroptical properties. Temporal control of the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C leads to aggregate mixtures consisting of different ratios of Agg. B and Agg. C that show wavelength&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
An amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 bearing two chiral hydrophilic side chains with S&#8208;stereogenic centers was synthesized. This dye exhibited kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H2O (9/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The (S)&#8208;1 monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off&#8208;pathway species Agg. A, which was spontaneously transformed into an on&#8208;pathway metastable aggregate (Agg. B) and subsequently into the thermodynamic Agg. C. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (S)&#8208;1 displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J&#8208;aggregation characteristics were observed for both Agg. B and Agg. C, such as Davydov&#8208;split absorption bands (Agg. B), extremely sharp and intense J&#8208;band with large bathochromic shift (Agg. C), non&#8208;diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that Agg. A had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod&#8208;like helical nanostructures with left&#8208;handedness were observed respectively for Agg. B and Agg. C. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C, thin films consisting of Agg. B and Agg. C with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788&#8211;805&#8197;nm and g&#8208;factors between &#8722;4.2&#215;10&#8722;2 and &#8722;5.1&#215;10&#8722;2.

         <title>Utility of Triethyloxonium Tetrafluoroborate for Chloride Removal during Sarcosine N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Synthesis: Improving NCA Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate enables efficient chloride removal during sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride synthesis allowing the controlled amine&#8208;initiated ring opening polymerization. This approach can avoid sublimation or other intensive purification of NCAs and NNCAs easing the synthesis of polypeptides, polypeptoids, and polypeptp(o)ides.







Abstract
The clinical translation of polysarcosine (pSar) as polyethylene glycol (PEG) replacement in the development of novel nanomedicines creates a broad demand of polymeric material in high&#8208;quality making high&#8208;purity sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (Sar&#8208;NCA) as monomer for its production inevitable. Within this report, we present the use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis with focus on amino acid and chloride impurities to avoid the sublimation of Sar&#8208;NCAs. With a view towards upscaling into kilogram or ton scale, a new methodology of monomer purification is introduced by utilizing the Meerwein's Salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to remove chloride impurities by covalent binding and converting chloride ions into volatile products within a single step. The novel straightforward technique enables access to monomers with significantly reduced chloride content (&lt;100&#8197;ppm) compared to Sar&#8208;NCA derived by synthesis or sublimation. The derived monomers enable the controlled&#8208;living polymerization in DMF and provide access to pSar polymers with Poisson&#8208;like molecular weight distribution within a high range of chain lengths (Xn 25&#8211;200). In conclusion, the reported method can be easily applied to Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis or purification of commercially available pSar&#8208;NCAs and eases access to well&#8208;defined hetero&#8208;telechelic pSar polymers.

         <title>Replacement of Toxic Hydrazines in Satellite Propulsion with Greener Dinitramide&#8208;Based Energetic Ionic Liquid Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazine&#8208;free liquid ionic candidate formulations for satellite propulsion have been identified and prepared. They are based on the dinitramide anion, which is environmentally more benign. An initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides was first weened to 3 candidates, from which only one was retained that has acceptable sensitivities and melting point.







Abstract
Satellite propulsion uses liquid mono or bi&#8208;propellants composed of a hydrazine in combination with a strong oxidant. However, hydrazines are highly toxic. As a result, many research efforts for more environmentally compatible propellants have been made over the past decade. In this study we evidence green formulations that retain high propulsive performances. They are based on the dinitramide anion. From an initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides 3 best candidates were selected after evaluation of their potential syntheses, calculated theoretical performances, experimental synthesis optimizations and decomposition temperatures. These three salts were then formulated to obtain acceptable sensitivities and melting points, which eventually led to only one formulation being retained: a 40&#8201;:&#8201;60 mixture of dimethylammonium dinitramide and ammonium dinitramide phlegmatized by 10&#8201;% of glycerol.

         <title>Mono&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Beryllated Carbodiphosphoranes: Synthesis, Structure, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated carbodiphosphoranes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond, have been synthesised. The bonding situation in these complexes was elucidated computationally, while their reactivity was investigated experimentally.







Abstract
The reaction of organoberyllium compounds with hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane yields mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated complexes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond. The bonding situation in these compounds together with a simple carbodiphosphorane and an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene adduct was analysed with energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence as well as with quantum theory of atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules. Furthermore, the driving forces accountable for mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllation were elucidated along with the reactivity of the Be=C bond.

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;Emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct visualization of the catalytic activity of electrode materials, represented by the labelled metal plates, via an array of light&#8208;emitting diodes, is symbolized by glowing eyes. Integrated into a bipolar electrochemical set&#8208;up, depicted by the &#948;&#8722; and &#948;+ polarization, such a system allows the efficiency of the anodic and cathodic catalysts for water splitting to be evaluated in a single image. The result is an instantaneous optical readout of catalytic information, complementary to classic electrochemical techniques. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Kuhn, G. Salinas and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400078).

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot on the first azobenzene&#8208;based metallocycle that reversibly undergoes photoisomerization without disassembly! The cover feature illustrates the reversible switching between the (E,E) and (Z,Z) isomers of [Cu2(3,3&#8217;&#8208;azobenz(metPA)2](BF4)2. The electronic spectra reflect the unique combination of femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption in solution and femtosecond pump&#8211;probe photodissociation in the gas phase, which were used to characterize the primary switching dynamics. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Riehn, R. Diller, S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400205).

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8242;s nucleocapsid protein/RNA biocondensates with antimicrobial peptides is an effective strategy to block or slow down RNA transcription, thus preventing virions&#8217; assembly. Our biophysical results illustrate how peptides can modify the dynamics and morphology of such droplets. Depending on the peptides&#8217; characteristics, which regulate their partitioning into the droplets, various effects have been observed, including droplet clustering and the formation of fibrillar aggregates. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Oliva, R. Winter and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400048).

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile in neutral buffer can be temperature controlled. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) is important, and the selective construction of perforated vesicles or nanofibers is achieved by heating the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile to 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt;LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&lt;LCST) and then cooling it to room temperature.

         <title>Short peptide and amino acid&#8208;based supramolecular ionogels and eutectogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capability of peptide and amino acid&#8208;based molecules to act as ionogelators and eutectogelators entrapping ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) forming ionogels and eutectogels has gathered attention in recent decades. The self&#8208;assembly process, primarily driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions as hydrogen bonding, remains serendipitous in nature. &#160;This review provides a comprehensive and detailed report on self&#8208;assembly of unmodified and modified amino acids and peptides in the non&#8208;conventional solvents, ILs and DESs. Understanding these processes holds great promise for the development of innovative soft&#8208;materials, and to the progress of supramolecular systems in non&#8208;conventional solvent environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene as Precursor of 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;Substituted Long&#8208;Axially Symmetric Pyrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrene derivatives bearing substituents at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 find numerous applications, as exemplified by their use in lasers, sensors, and bioimaging probes. However, these derivatives typically have point&#8208;symmetric or short&#8208;axially symmetric structures, whereas long&#8208;axially symmetric derivatives remain underexplored because of the difficulty in obtaining their precursor, 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene. To address this problem, we herein synthesized 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene in an overall yield (71% over four steps) considerably exceeding those of existing methods. 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene was converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron&#8208;donor (alkoxy) groups at positions 1 and 3 and electron&#8208;acceptor (formyl) groups at positions 6 and 8. 13OPA exhibited photophysical properties distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers, featuring a broad and strongly redshifted absorption, strong fluorescence with reduced sensitivity to protic solvents, and small dipole moment change upon photoexcitation. The derivatization of 13OPA into a Schiff base and its functionalization via Lewis acid&#8211;base pairing were also demonstrated. Thus, our work expands the design scope of pyrene&#8208;based molecules, particularly those used as emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An advanced insulin synthesis is presented that utilizes one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide bond formation enabled by acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxides in the presence of chloride anion. S&#8208;chlorocysteine generated from cysteine sulfoxides reacts with an S&#8208;protected cysteine to afford S&#8208;sulfenylsulfonium cation, which then furnishes the disulfide or reversely returns to the starting materials depending on the S&#8208;protection employed and the reaction conditions. Use of S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys(Acm)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) selectively give the disulfide under weak acid conditions in the presence of MgCl2 even if S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine (Cys(MBzl)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) are also present. In contrast, the S&#8208;MBzl pair yields the disulfide under more acidic conditions in the presence of a chloride anion source. These reaction conditions allowed a one&#8208;pot insulin synthesis. Additionally, lipidated insulin was prepared by a one&#8208;pot disulfide&#8208;bonding/lipidation sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>The Characterization of Multifaceted PREP1 Peptides Provides Insights into Correlations between Spectroscopic and Structural Properties of Amyloid&#8208;like Assemblies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread ability of proteins and peptides to self&#8208;assemble by forming cross&#8208;&#946; structure is one of the most significant discoveries in structural biology. Intriguingly, the cross&#8208;&#946; association of proteins/peptides may generate intricate supramolecular architectures with uncommon spectroscopic properties. We have recently characterized self&#8208;assembled peptides extracted from the PREP1 protein that are endowed with interesting structural/spectroscopic properties. We here demonstrate that the green fluorescence emission of the peptide PREP1[117&#8208;132] (&#955;em ~ 520 nm), can be induced by excitation with UV radiation. The associated unusually large Stokes shift (&#916;&#955; ~ 150 nm) represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of an internal resonance energy transfer in amyloid&#8208;like structures, where the blue emission of some assemblies becomes the excitation radiation for others. Moreover, the characterization of PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants provides insights into the sequence/structure and structure/spectroscopic properties relationships. Our data suggests that the green fluorescence is plausibly associated with antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet states of the peptide whereas parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are only endowed with blue fluorescence. Notably, the different PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants also form assemblies characterized by distinct morphologies. Indeed, the parent peptide and single mutants form compact but structured aggregates whereas most of the double mutants exhibit elongated and highly extended fibers.</dc:description>

         <title>KpsS1 Mediates the Glycosylation of Pseudaminic Acid in Acinetobacter Baumannii</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is found in the polysaccharide structures of the cell surface of various Gram&#8208;negative pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii and considered as an important component of cell surface glycans including oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. However, the glycosyltransferase that is responsible for the Pse glycosylation in A. baumannii remains unknown yet. In this study, through comparative genomics analysis of Pse&#8208;positive and negative A. baumannii clinical isolates, we identified a potential glycosyltransferase, KpsS1, located right downstream of the Pse biosynthesis genetic locus. Deletion of this gene in an Pse&#8208;positive A. baumannii strain, Ab8, impaired the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins, while the gene knockout strain, Ab8&#916;kpsS1, could still produce Pse with 2.86 folds higher amount than that of Ab8. Furthermore, impairment of Pse glycosylation affected the morphology and virulence potential of A. baumannii, suggesting the important role of this protein. This study will provide insights into the further understanding of Pse in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Engraved Lattice&#8208;Matched NiO/NiFe2O4 Heterostructure with Ample Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Water Electrolysis and Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma&#8208;engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8211;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus&#8208;prepared Vo&#8208;NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4 mV dec&#8211;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice-matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo-NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma-engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice-matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8211;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus-prepared Vo-NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4 mV dec&#8211;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the two-electrode configuration water electrolyzer and rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled by Vo-NiO/NiFe2O4 catalyst show the potential practical application directions. This work provides an innovative avenue for strengthening OER performance toward water electrolysis and Zn-air batteries via the interface and vacancy engineering strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Central Metals in Bulky Phthalocyanines for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II), and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and well&#8208;established bulky peripheral substituents (either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy) were synthesized and tested as sensitizers in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The trend of photovoltaic efficiencies (PCEs) for free&#8208;base and metallo Pcs followed the order Zn(II)Pc &gt; Mg(II)Pc &gt;&gt; H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc regardless of the peripheral substitution. Higher efficiencies (4.95 versus. 3.63 for the Zn(II) derivatives) were achieved with Pcs bearing the bulkier 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy group, indicating a lower aggregation and more suitable HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels. Furthermore, these derivatives showed a more relevant influence of the metal on the PCE (from the highest value of 4.95 for the Zn(II)Pc to the lowest value of 0.23 for the Ru(II)Pc. In both series, the best PCEs observed with the Zn(II) derivatives were mainly due to their highest Jsc values. The lowest efficiencies found for the free&#8208;bases and Ru(II) derivatives were attributed to a mismatch between their LUMO levels and the conduction band of the TiO2 and lower light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, respectively. In conclusion, Zn(II) derivatives are still the best Pc candidates to use as sensitizers in molecular photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Emission for Tumor Visualization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with ordered &#960; structures are very promising in porous light&#8208;emitting materials. However, most of these COFs are either poor in luminescence or lack of water&#8208;stability. Herein, a series of isostructural D&#8208;A vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed based a new D2h symmetric linker 1,4&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TMTA) with high crystallinity, comparative high surface area and excellent chemical/thermal stability. Impressively, their adsorption and luminescence wavelength vary with respect to the density of &#960;&#8208;systems in the electron&#8208;donating group, which constitute the foundation for molecular engineering the luminescent properties of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. The DFT calculations further established the relationship between the luminescence properties and the donor electronic structure. Moreover, one of representative COF named FZU&#8208;203 showed inspiring applications in bioimaging, which may further provide strategic guidance for the use of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs as fluorescent nanoprobes in non&#8208;invasive medical diagnosis and visualization therapy of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Domino Reactions at an Imidazole Relay Control the Oxidation of a TyrZ&#8208;His190 Artificial Mimic of Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A close mimic of P680 and the TyrosineZ&#8208;Histidine190 pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole&#8208;phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation. The fast phase (&#964; &lt; 50 ns) corresponds to partial oxidation of the imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand, proton transfer within the hydrogen bond, and formation of a neutral phenoxyl radical. The slow phase (5 &#8208; 9 &#181;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1&#8208;nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Cyclic Trimer of a Chiral Spirosilabifluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic compound (Si&#8208;[3]), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (C&#8208;[3]), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro&#8208;conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound Si&#8208;[3] was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of Si&#8208;[3]. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of Si&#8208;[3] with D3&#8208;symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (M,M,M)&#8208;Si&#8208;[3] showed high emission quantum yield (&#934;f = 80%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (glum,exp = &#8722;1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3). According to the the time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT)&#160;calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from Si&#8208;[3] was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully&#8208;allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of tf = 1.89 ns.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Basic Ligands and Alkenes on the Regioselectivity of C&#8722;H Additions of Tertiary Amines to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of several types of tertiary amines with alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium(III) alkyl complexes. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates enabled to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines.







Abstract
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines and tertiary alkyl amines with simple alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium alkyl complexes. This protocol provided an efficient and atom&#8208;economical route to structurally diverse tertiary amine derivatives. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates were found to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines presumably due to the generation of different types of catalytically active species or the formation of relatively stable intermediates. On the basis of the deuterium labeling experiments and KIE experiments, possible catalytical cycles were provided to understand the reaction mechanism as well as the regioselectivity.

         <title>Iridium Pyridylpyrrolides Hyperpolarised by Para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions with para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) dramatically enhance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. We explore the possibilities of a ligand new to this field, pyridylpyrrolides. These complexes display highly reversible hydrogen activation and repeatable hyperpolarisation in a variety of solvents, without the reduction of alkene ligands. Ligand functional group modifications reveal an untapped potential chemical scope for the development of hyperpolarisation catalysts.







Abstract
Chemical activation of the nuclear singlet state of dihydrogen, para&#8208;hydrogen, can dramatically increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Here, we show that the highly reversible activation of para&#8208;hydrogen by an iridium pyridylpyrrolide complex is capable of producing this hyperpolarisation effect. Bound alkene ligands exhibit signal enhancement without reduction to alkanes, which is in contrast to the most widely used hyperpolarisation catalysts. The complex is recoverable due to the highly reversible binding and release of H2, and result in enhanced hydride signals in a wide range of coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating deuterated solvents. Synthetic modification of the ligand substituents and the addition of co&#8208;ligands show a strong dependence of chemical structure on reactivity, which reveals an untapped potential to exploit pyridylpyrrolides as ligands in the development of tunable para&#8208;hydrogen induced hyperpolarisation catalysts or molecular probes.

&lt;p&gt;Reactions with para-hydrogen (p-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dramatically enhance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. We explore the possibilities of a ligand new to this field, pyridylpyrrolides. These complexes display highly reversible hydrogen activation and repeatable hyperpolarisation in a variety of solvents, without the reduction of alkene ligands. Ligand functional group modifications reveal an untapped potential chemical scope for the development of hyperpolarisation catalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation can be efficiently achieved with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities through two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes a conventional method, involving the reduction of nickel salt (NiBr2&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) using manganese metal. The second method employs a one&#8208;step electrochemical reaction, utilizing the sacrificial anode process and NiBr2bipy catalysis. Both methods yield silylated heterocycles in good to high yields through a&#160;syn&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#160;cyclization process. Control experiments and molecular electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry) provided further insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Solution Behavior of Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Complexes with Tripodal&#160;N&#8208;Donor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of multiple rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complexes (Ln = Y, La, Ce, Sm, Lu) using tripodal&#160;N&#8208;donor ligands, which offer the key advantage of featuring only C, H, O and N elements, facilitating incineration to recover the metal. The structural properties of the Ln3+&#160;complexes were investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing that the ligands form complexes with a 1:1 ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio, with two of the three triflate anions coordinated to the metal centers in all cases. The coordination of the third triflate anion was found to be variable, as supported by various NMR spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, transitioning from the previously reported tris(hydrazonyl)thiophosphanyl (SP)&#8208;based ligand system to the herein reported tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl) amine (tren)&#8208;anchored ligand system enhanced flexibility, resulting in improved encapsulation of the lanthanide ions. Competition studies between the two systems revealed selective coordination of the lutetium ion with the more flexible system. Thus, enhancing the flexibility of the ligand systems used for extraction has the potential to increase their efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its first synthesis by Clar in 1948, terrylene &#8208; a fully connected ternaphthalene oligomer via naphthalene&#8217;s peri&#8208;positions &#8208; has gained special focus within the rylene family, drawing interest for its unique chemical, structural, optoelectronic and single photon emission properties. In this study, we introduce a novel synthetic pathway that enhances the solubility of terrylene derivatives through complete peri&#8208;alkylation, while also facilitating extensions at the bay&#8208;positions. This approach not only broadens the scope of terrylene&#8217;s chemical versatility but also opens new avenues for developing solution processable novel multi&#8208;edge nanographenes and tailoring electronic energy levels through topological edge structures. Our findings include a comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterization which include transient absorption spectroscopy and photophysics of both the synthesized peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its phenylene&#8208;fused derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Dyes for Photoacoustic Imaging and Their Use as Analyte&#8208;Responsive Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing imaging tools that can report on the presence of disease&#8208;relevant analytes in multicellular organisms can provide insight into fundamental disease mechanisms as well as provide diagnostic tools for the clinic. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a light&#8208;in, sound&#8208;out imaging technique that allows for high resolution, deep&#8208;tissue imaging with applications in pre&#8208;clinical and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. The continued development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing small&#8208;molecule dyes promises to improve the capabilities of this emerging imaging modality. For example, new dye scaffolds bearing chemoselective functionalities are enabling the detection and quantification of disease&#8208;relevant analytes through activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS) approaches. Recently described strategies to engineer NIR absorbing xanthenes have enabled development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI probes using this classic dye scaffold. Herein, we present current strategies for red&#8208;shifting the spectral properties of xanthenes via bridging heteroatom or auxochrome modifications. Additionally, we explore how these strategies, coupled with chemoselective spiroring&#8208;opening approaches, have been employed to create ABS probes for in vivo detection of hypochlorous acid, nitric oxide, copper (II), human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1, and carbon monoxide. Given the versatility of the xanthene scaffold, we anticipate continued growth and development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI imaging probes based on this dye class.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying Cation Exchange in {Cr7Co} Pseudorotaxanes: Preparatory Studies for Hybrid Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the design of dynamic supramolecular systems used in molecular machines, it is important to understand the binding preferences between the macrocycle and stations along the thread. Here, we apply&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the relative stabilities of a series of linear alkylammonium templated pseudorotaxanes with the general formula [H2NRR&#8217;][Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16] by exchanging the cation in solution. Our results show that the pseudorotaxanes are able to exchange threads via a dissociative mechanism. The position of equilibrium is dependent upon the ammonium cation and solvent used. Short chain primary ammonium cations are shown to be far less favourable macrocycle stations than secondary ammonium cations. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) has been used to look at disassembly of the pseudorotaxanes in a solvent&#8208;free environment and stability trends compared to those in acetone&#8208;d6. The energy needed to induce 50% of the precursor ion loss (E50) is used shows a similar trend to the equilibria measured by NMR. The relative stabilities of these hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes are different to those of host&#8208;guest compounds involving crown ethers and this may be valuable for the design of molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size: A Key Parameter in Modulating Carbonyl Compound Properties</title>

A multi&#8208;functional group! Replacing oxygen in a carbonyl functional group for the larger, but less electronegative chalcogens, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the C=X group electronegativity in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960;HOMO&#8211;&#960;LUMO gap. This tunability of the properties of carbonyl compounds holds applications in many fields of chemistry, including supramolecular chemistry, organocatalysis, and photo(electro)chemistry.







Abstract
Exchanging oxygen in the functional group C=O (i.&#8201;e., carbonyl) for the less electronegative Group 16 elements, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the electronegativity of the C=X group in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960; HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses revealed that the steric size of the chalcogen atom X is at the origin of this seemingly counterintuitive behavior. This tuning of the chemical properties of carbonyl compounds by varying the chalcogen atom size in the C=X bond can be applied in many fields of chemistry. This concept article delineates several useful applications in the fields of organocatalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and photo(electro)chemistry.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Specified Coupling Reactions of Nitroarenes by Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being different from conventional reductive coupling reactions of nitroarenes, structurally modifiable heterogeneous cobalt catalysts reveal excellent performance in precise use of a single intermediate during the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of the nitroarenes. This concept would provide a novel direction for the efficient utilization of nitroaromatics in the manufacture of high&#8208;value products.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study on reduction&#8211;specified coupling reactions of the nitroarenes by heterogeneous cobalt catalysis opens a door for diversified syntheses of functional N&#8208;containing molecules. Guided by the structure&#8211;function relationship of heterogeneous materials, rational design of nano&#8211;catalysts can effectively regulate the routes of organic reactions. Precise transformation of the intermediates generated during the nitroarene reduction with a suitable nano&#8211;catalyst is a promising way to develop new tandem reactions, and to synthesize structurally novel compounds that are of difficult access with the conventional approaches.

         <title>Covalent Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>

Covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a powerful research paradigm capable of constructing metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with customized structures and properties. A variety of efficient organic reactions have been developed for the functionalization of MOCs, and these new products have shown potential applications in multiple fields.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are supramolecular coordination complexes that have internal cavities for hosting guest molecules and exhibiting various properties. However, the functions of MOCs are limited by the choice of the building blocks. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a technique that can introduce new functional groups and replace existing ones on the MOCs without changing their geometry. Among many PSM methods, covalent PSM is a promising approach to modify MOCs with tailored structures and functions. Covalent PSM can be applied to either the internal cavity or the external surface of the MOCs, depending on the functionality expected to be customized. However, there are still some challenges and limitations in the field of covalent PSM of MOCs, such as the balance between the stability of MOCs and the harshness of organic reactions involved in covalent PSMs. This concept article introduces the organic reaction types involved in covalent PSM of MOCs, their new applications after modification, and summarizes and provides an outlook of this research field.

         <title>Molybdenum(0)&#8208;Tricarbonyl Complex Supported by an Azacalix&#8208;pyridine Ligand: Synthesis, Characterization, Surface Deposition and Conversion to a Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Trioxo Complex with O2</title>

         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of a molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an azacalixpyridine ligand. This complex can activate CO and reacts with dioxygen (O2) in solution, in the solid state and on surfaces to form a molybdenum(VI) trioxo complex which mediates O&#8208;transfer from dioxygen to external substrates.







Abstract
Adsorption of metal&#8208;organic complexes on metallic surfaces to produce well&#8208;defined single site catalysts is a novel approach combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To avoid the &#8220;surface trans&#8208;effect&#8221; a dome&#8208;shaped molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an tolylazacalix[3](2,6)pyridine ligand is synthesized. This vacuum&#8208;evaporable complex both activates CO and reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form a Mo(VI) trioxo complex which in turn is capable of catalytically mediating oxygen transfer. The molybdenum tricarbonyl&#8208; and trioxo complexes are investigated in the solid state, in homogeneous solution and on noble metal surfaces (Cu, Au) employing a range of spectroscopic and analytical methods.

A new method for synthesizing trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indoleketones by Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation was introduced. In the absence of additives, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl (an inexpensive and environmentally friendly synthetic block of trifluoromethyl) reacts with indole and carbon monoxide to generate trifluoromethylindole ketones with good yields, regioselectivity, and chemical selectivity; furthermore, the products exhibit strong resistance to basic functional groups, such as alkynes, aldehydes, and esters.







Abstract
3&#8208;Indole&#8208;3&#8208;one is a key intermediate in the synthesis of many drugs and plays an important role in synthetic chemistry and biochemistry. A new method for synthesizing trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indoleketones by Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation was introduced. In the absence of additives, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl (an inexpensive and environmentally friendly synthetic block of trifluoromethyl) reacts with indole and carbon monoxide to generate trifluoromethylindole ketones with good yields, regioselectivity, and chemical selectivity; furthermore, the products exhibit strong resistance to basic functional groups, such as alkynes, aldehydes, and esters. In addition to the conversion of indole compounds into corresponding products, pyrrole and heteroindole may be suitable for corresponding chemical transformations. This study provides a synthetic method for the further construction of trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indole ketones.

In addition to the conversion of indole compounds into corresponding products, pyrrole and heteroindole may be suitable for corresponding chemical transformations. This study provides a synthetic method for the further construction of trifluoromethylated 3-indole ketones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evaluating Diazene to N2 Interconversion at Iron&#8208;Sulfur Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interconversion of N2H2 and N2 is probed using &#956;&#8208;N2H2 iron&#8208;sulfur complexes. An intermediate trapped at low temperature was formerly presumed to be a &#956;&#8208;N2 species, but new in&#8197;situ spectroscopic characterization shows a new assignment. Our results are used to predict requirements to observe iron&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based reversible proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) for N2 fixation.







Abstract
Biological N2 reduction occurs at sulfur&#8208;rich multiiron sites, and an interesting potential pathway is concerted double reduction/ protonation of bridging N2 through PCET. Here, we test the feasibility of using synthetic sulfur&#8208;supported diiron complexes to mimic this pathway. Oxidative proton transfer from &#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;diazene (HN=NH) is the microscopic reverse of the proposed N2 fixation pathway, revealing the energetics of the process. Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two&#8208;electron oxidation of [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2H2)] (L1=tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C as [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)]2+, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N2 complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr3)L1}(&#951;2&#8208;N2H2)]+. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature. Also, PCET from the bridging diazene is highly exergonic as a result of the high Fe3+/2+ redox potential, indicating that the reverse N2 protonation would be too endergonic to proceed. This system establishes the &#8220;ground rules&#8221; for designing reversible N2/N2H2 interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.

         <title>Dynamics and Coordination of a P2N2 Ligand &#8211; from Twisted Conformation to Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
P2N2&#8208;ligands can adopt different conformations among which the twisted form is here characterized unambiguously for the first time using SCXRD. Additionally four respective Mo and W complexes are crystallographically analyzed. The electronic structures of the complexes are compared using spectroscopic data and shown to be dominated by the metal center.







Abstract
Based on their general spacial flexibility, their Lewis and Br&#248;nsted basicity, and ability to mimic second sphere effects the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand family and their complexes have regained substantial scientific interest. It was now possible to structurally analyze a recently reported member of this family with p&#8208;tolyl and t&#8208;butyl substituents on P and N, respectively, (P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu). Notably, the ligand crystallizes with a &#8216;twisted&#8217; backbone. This compound is the very first of its kind to have been unambiguously characterized with regard to its chemical and molecular structure as being in this conformation. A temperature&#8208;dependent NMR study provides insight into the molecular dynamics of two isomers in solution, which are most likely also both twisted, as judged by the observed limited reactivity. Despite the in principle unfavorable conformation of the free ligand, it was successfully chelated to tungsten and molybdenum centers in mononuclear carbonyl complexes. The ligand, a derivative thereof and four new complexes were comprehensively characterized and analyzed in comparison. This includes single crystal XRD molecular structures of P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu and all four complexes. P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu, regardless of its twisted conformation, is able to coordinate to metal centers given that enough energy (heat) for a conformational change is provided.

         <title>QM/MM Study Into the Mechanism of Oxidative C=C Double Bond Cleavage by Lignostilbene&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dioxygenase</title>

Insert text for Table of Contents here: A QM/MM study on the lignin activating nonheme iron enzyme lignostilbene&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;dioxygenase is presented and shows that the mechanism is driven by electrostatic interactions in the protein pocket that trigger an early electron transfer and guides the reaction to a dioxetane intermediate.







Abstract
The enzymatic biosynthesis of fragrance molecules from lignin fragments is an important reaction in biotechnology for the sustainable production of fine chemicals. In this work we investigated the biosynthesis of vanillin from lignostilbene by a nonheme iron dioxygenase using QM/MM and tested several suggested proposals via either an epoxide or dioxetane intermediate. Binding of dioxygen to the active site of the protein results in the formation of an iron(II)&#8722;superoxo species with lignostilbene cation radical. The dioxygenase mechanism starts with electrophilic attack of the terminal oxygen atom of the superoxo group on the central C=C bond of lignostilbene, and the second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in the substrate binding pocket guide the reaction towards dioxetane formation. The computed mechanism is rationalized with thermochemical cycles and valence bond schemes that explain the electron transfer processes during the reaction mechanism. Particularly, the polarity of the protein and the local electric field and dipole moments enable a facile electron transfer and an exergonic dioxetane formation pathway.

         <title>Regulation of Fluorescence and Self&#8208;assembly of a Salicylaldehyde Azine&#8208;Containing Amphiphile by Pillararene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile G by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 via host&#8211;guest recognition in water. The fluorescence emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G can be tailored by WP5 or pH conditions. This emission regulatable system was applied in the field of information encryption, rewritable materials, and erasable ink.







Abstract
Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene via host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self&#8208;assembled aggregates of the bola&#8208;type amphiphile G can be tailored by adding different amounts of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5). In addition, the emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G and WP5 are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of G and the regulation by WP5 or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.

&lt;p&gt;Here we report the regulation of fluorescence and self-assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine-containing amphiphile &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; by a water-soluble pillar[5]arene &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; host&#8211;guest recognition in water. The fluorescence emission property and self-assembly behavior of &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; can be tailored by &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt; or pH conditions. This emission regulatable system was applied in the field of information encryption, rewritable materials, and erasable ink.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation of fluorescence and self-assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine-containing amphiphile by a water-soluble pillar[5]arene &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self-assembled aggregates of the bola-type amphiphile &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; can be tailored by adding different amounts of water-soluble pillar[5]arene (&lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt;). In addition, the emission property and self-assembly behavior of &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt; are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; and the regulation by &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt; or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic, Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond in Lignin Models and Native Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic strategy is developed for oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in lignin models and natural lignin at room temperature. This strategy exhibits several advantages, such as aerobic environment, abundant and inexpensive chloride salts, facile generation of chlorine radical in the presence of organocatalyst, thus representing a significant advancement in the valorization of lignin into highly value&#8208;added aromatic products.







Abstract
It is challenging to realize the selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages for production of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals due to its intrinsic inertness and complex structure. Here we report a light&#8208;driven, chlorine&#8208;radical&#8208;based protocol to realize the oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage in various lignin model compounds catalyzed by commercially available TPT and CaCl2, achieving high conversion and good to high product yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the preferential activation of C&#946;&#8722;H bond facilitates the oxidation and C&#8722;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model via chlorine radical. Furthermore, this method is also applicable to the depolymerization of natural lignin extracts, furnishing the aromatic oxygenates from the cleavage of C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bonds. This study provides experimental foundations to the depolymerization and valorization of lignin into high value&#8208;added aromatic compounds.

         <title>One&#8211;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of NVO Cathodes with Varied Lattice NH4+ Content: Effect on Structural Evolution and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a one&#8211;step hydrothermal synthesis method to regulate the lattice NH4+ ion content in vanadium oxide materials and discover varied lattice NH4+ content could affect the structural evolution and electrochemical performance of the material, and our work will provide a new route for designing high performance vanadium oxide cathode materials in aqueous zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH4+ in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH4+ content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH4+ by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH4+ exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex&#8208;situ structural characterizations, and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH4+ content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides&#8242; structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high&#8211;performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.

This study describes the investigation of the conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0)&#8208;tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI)&#8208;trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) in detail with different spectroscopic and analytical methods. The reaction takes place in solution, in solid state and as well on noble metal surface and is accelerated by exposure to light. The experimentally findings can be explained by DFT calculation and in sum a reaction mechanism is derived.







Abstract
The conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0) tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI) trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) is investigated in homogeneous solution and in a molecular film adsorbed on Au(111) using a variety of spectroscopic and analytical methods. These studies in particular show that the dome&#8208;shaped carbonyl complex adsorbed on the metal surface has the ability to bind and activate gaseous oxygen, overcoming the so&#8208;called surface trans&#8208;effect. Furthermore, the rate of the conversion dramatically increases by irradiation with light. This observation is explained with the help of complementary DFT calculations and attributed to two different pathways, a thermal and a photochemical one. Based on the experimental and theoretical findings, a molecular mechanism for the conversion of the carbonyl to the oxo complex is derived.

         <title>Co(II) Substitution Enhances the Esterase Activity of a de Novo Designed Zn(II) Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(II) analogue of the designed peptide Zn(II)(TRIL23H)3 is made as a spectroscopic probe for the carbonic anhydrase activity exhibited by this de novo designed system. The coordination geometry of Co(II) and Zn(II) are vastly different at high and low pH. Nonetheless, the Co(II) analogue at high pH exceeds the catalytic efficiency of the parent Zn(II) protein.







Abstract
Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) have been a target for de&#8197;novo protein designers due to the simplicity of the active site and rapid rate of the reaction. The first reported mimic contained a Zn(II) bound to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and an exogenous water molecule, hence closely mimicking the native enzymes&#8217; first coordination sphere. Co(II) has served as an alternative metal to interrogate CAs due to its d7 electronic configuration for more detailed solution characterization. We present here the Co(II) substituted [Co(II)(H2O/OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3n+ that behaves similarly to native Co(II) substituted human&#8208;CAs. Like the Zn(II) analogue, the cobalt&#8208;derivative at slightly basic pH is incapable of hydrolyzing p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA); however, as the pH is increased a significant activity develops, which at pH values above 10 eventually yields a catalytic efficiency that exceeds that of the [Zn(II)(OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3+ peptide complex. X&#8208;ray absorption analysis is consistent with an octahedral species at pH&#8197;7.5 that converts to a 5&#8208;coordinate species by pH&#8197;11. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy can monitor this transition, giving a pKa for the conversion of 10.3. We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate Co(II)(Nimid)3(OH)(H2O) species. The pH dependent kinetic analysis indicates the maximal rate (kcat), and thus the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), follow the same pH profile as the spectroscopic conversion to the pentacoordinate species. This correlation suggests that the chemically irreversible ester hydrolysis corresponds to the rate determining process.

We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5-coordinate Co(II)(N&lt;sub&gt;imid&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) species. The pH dependent kinetic analysis indicates the maximal rate (k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;), and thus the catalytic efficiency (k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), follow the same pH profile as the spectroscopic conversion to the pentacoordinate species. This correlation suggests that the chemically irreversible ester hydrolysis corresponds to the rate determining process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of Lantern&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs) by Protective Control of Ligand Exchange Rates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stability of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) in solution depends on steric bulk and hydrophobicity proximal to the paddlewheel nodes. Increased bulk from alkyl side chains increases the effective half&#8208;life of the cages in competitive &#8220;MOC+MOC&#8221; equilibrations from thirty minutes to three hours. Solvent coligands play a similar role in protecting the metal nodes and reducing exchange rates.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling systems in nature display remarkable complexity with assemblies of different sub&#8208;units to generate functional species. Synthetic analogues of such systems are a challenge, often requiring the ability to bias distributions that are under thermodynamic assembly control. Using lantern&#8208;type MOCs (metal&#8208;organic cages) as a prototypical self&#8208;assembling system, herein we explore the role that steric bulk plays in controlling the exchange rate of ligands in paddlewheel&#8208;based assemblies, and thus the stability of cages, in competitive self&#8208;assembling scenarios. The effective lifetime of the lantern&#8208;type MOCs varies over an order of magnitude depending on the steric bulk proximal to the metal nodes with lifetimes of the cages ranging from tens of minutes to several hours. The bulk of the coordinating solvents likewise reduces the rate of ligand exchange, and thus yields longer&#8208;lived species. Understanding this subtle effect has implications for controlling the stability of complex assemblies in competitive environments with implications for guest release and application.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene has been synthesized by the combination of decarbonylative borylation, iodination and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. The racemization energy barrier of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of isomeric 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl.







Abstract
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene is a potentially attractive key component of an axially chiral biaryl compound, however, its structure and properties have not been clarified owing to the lack of its efficient synthesis. We report a breakthrough in the reliable synthesis of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene, which is achieved by the access to azulen&#8208;4&#8208;ylboronic acid pinacol ester and 4&#8208;iodoazulene as novel key synthetic intermediates for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene confirmed its axial chirality. The enantiomers of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene were successfully resolved by HPLC on the chiral stationary phase column. The kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the racemization energy barrier of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl.

Chemical access to the enigmatic death receptor ligand sFasL in its glycosylated version using a combination of native chemical and diselenide selenoester ligation.







Abstract
Controlled cell death is essential for the regulation of the immune system and plays a role in pathogen defense. It is often altered in pathogenic conditions such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. The Fas receptor and its corresponding membrane&#8208;bound ligand (FasL) are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway activated in these cases. A soluble form of FasL (sFasL), produced by ectodomain shedding, displays a diverse but still elusive set of non&#8208;apoptotic functions and sometimes even serves as a pro&#8208;survival factor. To gather more knowledge about the characteristics of this protein and the impact N&#8208;glycosylations may have, access to homogeneous posttranslationally modified variants of sFasL is needed. Therefore, we developed a flexible strategy to obtain such homogeneously N&#8208;glycosylated variants of sFasL by applying chemical protein synthesis. This strategy can be flexibly combined with enzymatic methods to introduce more complex, site selective glycosylations.

RNA one by one. Here, we present a first step towards controlled enzymatic RNA synthesis. We have explored the possibility of a simple protection step of the vicinal cis&#8208;diol moiety to temporarily block ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotides protected with acetals, particularly 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene, are well&#8208;tolerated by the template&#8208;independent RNA polymerase PUP and highly efficient coupling reactions can be achieved within minutes.







Abstract
Besides being a key player in numerous fundamental biological processes, RNA also represents a versatile platform for the creation of therapeutic agents and efficient vaccines. The production of RNA oligonucleotides, especially those decorated with chemical modifications, cannot meet the exponential demand. Due to the inherent limits of solid&#8208;phase synthesis and in&#8197;vitro transcription, alternative, biocatalytic approaches are in dire need to facilitate the production of RNA oligonucleotides. Here, we present a first step towards the controlled enzymatic synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides. We have explored the possibility of a simple protection step of the vicinal cis&#8208;diol moiety to temporarily block ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotides protected with acetals, particularly 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene, are well&#8208;tolerated by the template&#8208;independent RNA polymerase PUP (polyU polymerase) and highly efficient coupling reactions can be achieved within minutes &#8211; an important feature for the development of enzymatic de novo synthesis protocols. Even though purines are not equally well&#8208;tolerated, these findings clearly demonstrate the possibility of using cis&#8208;diol&#8208;protected ribonucleotides combined with template&#8208;independent polymerases for the stepwise construction of RNA oligonucleotides.

The (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2 complex emerged as a robust precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, showcasing notable selectivity in producing methane as the final product. In the course of the catalytic reaction, three&#8211;electron reduced nickel complexes with a formal nickel charge of +1 were identified as intermediates.







Abstract
Processing CO2 into value&#8211;added chemicals and fuels stands as one of the most crucial tasks in addressing the global challenge of the greenhouse effect. In this study, we focused on the complex (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2 (where dpp&#8211;bian is di&#8208;isopropylphenyl bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene) as a precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 as the sole product. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the realization of a catalytically effective pattern requires the three&#8211;electron reduction of (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr2. The chemically reduced complexes [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8211;bian)Ni(COD)]&#8722; and [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8211;bian)2Ni]&#8722; were synthesized and structurally characterized. Analyzing the data from the electron paramagnetic resonance study of the complexes in solutions, along with quantum&#8211;chemical calculations, reveals that the spin density is predominantly localized at their metal centers. The superposition of trajectory maps of the electron density gradient vector field 
 and the electrostatic force density field 
 per electron, as well as the atomic charges, discloses that, within the first coordination sphere, the interatomic charge transfer occurs from the metal atom to the ligand atoms and that the complex anions can thus be formally described by the general formulae (dpp&#8211;bian)2&#8722;Ni+(COD) and (dpp&#8211;bian)2&#8722;Ni+. It was also shown that the reduced nickel complexes can be oxidized by formic acid; resulting from this reaction, the two&#8211;electron and two&#8211;proton addition product dpp&#8211;bian&#8211;2H is formed.

&lt;p&gt;The (dpp&#8211;bian)NiBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex emerged as a robust precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, showcasing notable selectivity in producing methane as the final product. In the course of the catalytic reaction, three&#8211;electron reduced nickel complexes with a formal nickel charge of +1 were identified as intermediates.

         <title>Controlled Ring Opening of a Tetracyclic Tetraphosphane with Twofold Metallocene Bridging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented and highly symmetric twofold bridged P4&#8208;cycle has been embedded into a tetracyclic bisferrocenophane scaffold. Selective P&#8722;P bond can be achieved giving straightforward access to well&#8208;defined linear P4&#8208;snippets of different polarity or ultimately all&#8208;trans polyphosphanes.







Abstract
A direct route to a doubly ferrocene bridged tetracyclic tetraphosphane 1 was developed via reductive coupling of Fe(CpPCl2)2 (2&#8201;a), where a chlorine terminated linear P4&#8208;compound 3 could be identified as an intermediate. Selective P&#8722;P bond activation was further achieved by reacting 1 with elemental selenium or [Cp*Al]4, where regioselective insertion of Se or Al atoms resulted in ferrocenylene bridged [P4Se] (4) or [P4Al] (7) moieties. Compound 7 can be transformed to a hydrogen terminated linear P4 species, 8, with protic solvents. Methylation of compound 1 with MeOTf, proceeds via intermediate formation of monomethylated species 5, which gradually produced Me2&#8208;terminated dicationic 6, again containing a linear P4&#8208;unit. Besides spectroscopic characterization, the structural details of compounds 1, 4, 6, and 8 could be determined by SC&#8208;XRD. Moreover, DFT calculations were used to rationalize the reactivity of 1, derived compounds and intermediates. As a key feature, 1 undergoes ring opening polymerization to a linear polyphosphane 9.

A bright ring&#8208;opening! The first N&#8208;(cumarin&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;DABCO&#8208;based &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probe for thiols and selenols was designed and synthesized. Fluorescence intensity enhancement is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding the product with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). LODs for p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide are 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM respectively.







Abstract
Quaternary N&#8208;aryl&#8208;DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescence intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. The limits of detection for p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM, respectively.

         <title>Layer by Layer Spraying Fabrication of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Thin Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) thin film were prepared by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) based ligand through a liquid&#8208;phase epitaxial (LPE) layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) spraying method, which is named AIE surface&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks thin film (AIE&#8208;SURMOF). The obtained AIE&#8208;SURMOF has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property. Furthermore, by loading chiral guest in the MOF pore, the formed chiral encapsulated AIE&#8208;SURMOF can clearly indicate obvious circularly polarized luminescence performance.







Abstract
The development of new metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) thin films is important for expanding their functions and applications.

&lt;p&gt;A new kind of metal-organic framework (MOF) thin film were prepared by using aggregation-induced emission (AIE) based ligand through a liquid-phase epitaxial (LPE) layer-by-layer (LBL) spraying method, which is named AIE surface-coordinated metal-organic frameworks thin film (AIE-SURMOF). The obtained AIE-SURMOF has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property.

         <title>TBADT&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Stereoselective Radical Alkylation of Chiral N&#8208;Sulfinyl Imines: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Diverse Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. It utilizes non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, yielding diverse chiral amines with excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This approach offers efficient access to a variety of relevant &#945;&#8208;amino acids or alcohols and 1,2 diamines.







Abstract
Herein we describe a sustainable and efficient photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. By employing readily available non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and the cost&#8208;effective TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, we successfully obtain diverse chiral amines with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This method provides an efficient approach for accessing a diverse array of medicinally relevant compounds, including both natural and synthetic &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl ethyl amines, and other structural motifs commonly found in approved pharmaceuticals and natural product.

         <title>Modulating &#946;&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Atom&#8208;Transfer Radical Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atom&#8208;transfer radical addition reactions have been achieved by using covalent organic frameworks as visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysts without the need for transition metals, sacrificial agents, or base. Simple modification of the monomers enables the photocatalytic activity to be tuned.







Abstract
The atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction simultaneously forges carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;halogen bonds. However, frequently&#8208;used photosensitizers such as precious transition metal complexes, or organic dyes have limitations in terms of their potential toxicity and recyclability. Three &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediamines with variable transient photocurrent and photocatalytic activity have been prepared. A COF bearing electron&#8208;deficient Cl atoms displayed the highest photocatalytic activity toward the ATRA reaction of polyhalogenated alkanes to give halogenated olefins under visible light at room temperature. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibited good functional group tolerance and could be recycled without significant loss of activity.

The divalent lanthanoide triflates Ln(OTf)2(CH3CN) (Ln=Sm, Eu) were prepared from the respective trivalent triflates an the metals in acetonitrile. The new salts were characterized comprehensively including luminescence spectroscopy and magnetic measurements.







Abstract
The reaction of the trivalent lanthanoide triflates Ln(OTf)3 (Ln=Sm, Eu; OTf=CF3SO3&#8722;) with the respective metals in acetonitrile leads to the Ln(II)&#8208;triflates Eu(OTf)2(CH3CN) (monoclinic, P21/n, Z=4, a=1053.54(1), b=610.28(5), c=1946.92(2) pm, &#946; =98.611(4)) and Sm(OTf)2(CH3CN) (monoclinic, P21/n, Z=4, a=1054.41(4), b=612.16(2), c=1952.65(7) pm, &#946; =98.524(2)). The isotypic strontium compound Sr(OTf)2(CH3CN) (monoclinic, P21/n, Z=4, a=1056.39(5), b=610.05(3), c=1950.1(1) pm, &#946; =98.900(2)&#176;) has been obtained from SrCO3 and triflic acid. The compounds have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, thermal analysis, and magnetic measurements.

         <title>Chiral Bis&#8208;phosphate Macrocycles for Catalytic, Efficient, and Enantioselective Electrophilic Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles have been designed with an integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites for accommodating DABCO dications through complementary ion&#8208;pair interactions. Only 2&#8197;mol% of the macrocycle was necessary for efficiently catalyzing the fluorocyclization of tryptamines in up to 91&#8201;% ee, thus significantly outperforming the acyclic counterparts (lower reactivity; &lt;20&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Incorporation of privileged catalytic scaffolds into a macrocyclic skeleton represents an attractive strategy to furnish supramolecular catalysis systems with enzyme&#8208;mimetic cavity and multi&#8208;site cooperation. Herein we reported the synthesis, structure, binding properties and catalytic application of a series of chiral bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles toward the challenging asymmetric electrophilic fluorination. With a large, integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites, these macrocycles exhibited good inclusion toward 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) dicationic ammoniums through complementary ion&#8208;pair and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, as confirmed by crystallographic and solution binding studies. In fluorocyclization of tryptamines with Selectfluor reagent which has a similar DABCO&#8208;based dicationic structure, only 2&#8197;mol% macrocycle catalyst afforded the desired pyrroloindoline products in moderate yields and up to 91&#8201;% ee. For comparison, the acyclic mono&#8208;phosphate analogue gave obviously lower reactivity and enantioselectivity (&lt;20&#8201;% ee), suggesting a remarkable macrocyclic effect. The high catalytic efficiency and superior stereocontrol were ascribed to the tight ion&#8208;pair binding and cavity&#8208;directed noncovalent interaction cooperation.

The high catalytic efficiency and superior stereocontrol were ascribed to the tight ion-pair binding and cavity-directed noncovalent interaction cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Povarov Reaction: Reactivity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and reactivity of the Povarov reaction catalyzed by cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysts were discussed by DFT calculations, and importance of electrostatic energy on the reactivity was explored. The structure&#8208;property relationship between positive electrostatic potential and Gibbs free energy barrier was established to assess the reactivity. Furthermore, the importance of the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction in stereoselectivity was clarified for solving stereoselectivity in other reactions.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond catalysis, particularly cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis, is considered to be an effective strategy for organocatalysis. In this work, the cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis for the Povarov reaction between N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and ethyl vinyl ether was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction involves the cycloaddition process and the proton transfer process, and the rate&#8208;determining step is the cycloaddition process. Cationic hypervalent tellurium derivatives bearing CF3 and F groups exhibit superior catalytic activity. For the rate&#8208;determining step, the Gibbs free energy barrier decreases as the positive electrostatic potential of the chalcogen bond catalysts increases. More importantly, the Gibbs free energy barrier has a strong linear correlation with the electrostatic energy of the chalcogen bond in the catalyst&#8208;substrate complex. Furthermore, the catalytic reactions include the endo pathway and exo pathway. The C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between the substituent of the ethyl vinyl ether and the aryl ring of the N&#8208;benzylideneaniline contributes to the endo&#8208;selectivity of the reaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chalcogen bond catalysis, providing insights for designing chalcogen bond catalysts with high performance.

         <title>Reversible Coupling of Germylone with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge(0) compound 5 undergoes coupling with isocyanates to afford imine&#8208;ligated alkyl carboxamido germylenes 7 and 8. Moreover, this addition is reversible, as evidenced by an exchange reaction of 8 with p&#8208;tolyl isocyanate and by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The germylone dimNHCGe (5, dimNHC=diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with isocyanates RNCO (R=4&#8208;tolyl or 3,5&#8208;xylyl) to furnish novel alkyl carboxamido germylenes 7 (R=4&#8208;tolyl) and 8 (R=3,5&#8208;xylyl), featuring a C&#8722;C bond between the former carbene carbon and the isocyanate moiety. Heating a mixture of 8 with 4&#8208;tolyl isocyanate to 100&#8201;&#176;C results in isocyanate metathesis, demonstrating reversible C&#8722;C bond formation on the reduced germanium compound. DFT calculations suggest that this process occurs via the reductive dissociation of isocyanate from 8 that regenerates the parent Ge(0) compound 5.

The cover shows a cut&#8208;off of the structure of the divalent triflates Ln(CF3SO3)(CH3CN) (Ln = Sm, Eu). The compounds have been obtained by reacting the trivalent triflates with the respective lanthanoide metals in acetonitrile. They have been investigated comprehensively by luminescence spectroscopy, magnetic measurements, and cyclovoltammetry. The highly soluble triflates are promising starting materials for the preparation of further divalent lanthanoide materials. Thus, the new triflates are the new stars on the dancefloor of divalent lanthanoide compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Wickleder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400462).

The cover picture shows an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex on gold reacting with molecular oxygen to the corresponding Mo(VI) trioxo complex which in turn catalytically mediates oxygen transfer. The reactant and the (partly gaseous) products are analyzed with a range of (surface&#8208;) spectroscopic and analytical methods. If the carbonyl complex is irradiated (as shown in the picture), the rate of the conversion drastically increases. We thank Dr. Xiangzhi Meng for the graphics.

This review explores magnetic&#8211;plasmonic nanocomposites for SERS, focusing on their design, fabrication, and surface functionalization. It highlights their potential in applications like medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring and anticipates significant future contributions to scientific and technological advancements in these fields.







Abstract
Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace&#8211;level analytes, relies on plasmonic substrates. The choice of substrate, its morphology, and the excitation wavelength are crucial in SERS applications. To address advanced SERS requirements, the design and use of efficient nanocomposite substrates have become increasingly important. Notably, magnetic&#8211;plasmonic (MP) nanocomposites, which combine magnetic and plasmonic properties within a single particle system, stand out as promising nanoarchitectures with versatile applications in nanomedicine and SERS spectroscopy. In this review, we present an overview of MP nanocomposite fabrication methods, explore surface functionalization strategies, and evaluate their use in SERS. Our focus is on how different nanocomposite designs, magnetic and plasmonic properties, and surface modifications can significantly influence their SERS&#8208;related characteristics, thereby affecting their performance in specific applications such as separation, environmental monitoring, and biological applications. Reviewing recent studies highlights the multifaceted nature of these materials, which have great potential to transform SERS applications across a range of fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP nanocomposites, anticipating favorable developments that will make substantial contributions to various scientific and technological areas.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace&#8211;level analytes, relies on plasmonic substrates. The choice of substrate, its morphology, and the excitation wavelength are crucial in SERS applications. To address advanced SERS requirements, the design and use of efficient nanocomposite substrates have become increasingly important. Notably, magnetic&#8211;plasmonic (MP) nanocomposites, which combine magnetic and plasmonic properties within a single particle system, stand out as promising nanoarchitectures with versatile applications in nanomedicine and SERS spectroscopy. In this review, we present an overview of MP nanocomposite fabrication methods, explore surface functionalization strategies, and evaluate their use in SERS. Our focus is on how different nanocomposite designs, magnetic and plasmonic properties, and surface modifications can significantly influence their SERS-related characteristics, thereby affecting their performance in specific applications such as separation, environmental monitoring, and biological applications. Reviewing recent studies highlights the multifaceted nature of these materials, which have great potential to transform SERS applications across a range of fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP nanocomposites, anticipating favorable developments that will make substantial contributions to various scientific and technological areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances of Flexible MXene and its Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 24, April 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene has significant potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and rich surface chemical properties. This paper reviews the synthesis, preparation, performance, and electrochemical reaction mechanism of flexible MXenes; Summarized the latest progress in freestanding flexible MXene composites for supercapacitors, as well as the challenges and possible improvements in their practical applications.







Abstract
MXenes have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, rich surface chemistry, and convenient processability. These characteristics make them ideal for producing flexible materials with tunable microstructures. This paper reviews the laboratory research progress of flexible MXene and its composite materials for supercapacitors. And introduces the general synthesis method of MXene, as well as the preparation and properties of flexible MXene. By analyzing the current research status, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MXene was explained from the perspectives of electrolyte and surface terminating groups. This review particularly emphasizes the composite methods of freestanding flexible MXene composite materials. The review points out that the biggest problem with flexible MXene electrodes is severe self&#8208;stacking, which reduces the number of chemically active sites, weakens ion accessibility, and ultimately lowers electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to composite MXene with other electrode materials and design a good microstructure. This review affirms the enormous potential of flexible MXene and its composite materials in the field of supercapacitors. In addition, the challenges and possible improvements faced by MXene based materials in practical applications were also discussed.

In this paper, the mechanisms of five Fenton reactions are described in detail, and the carefully selected Fenton reagents and systems are discussed. Finally, the typical applications of Fenton reactions in the treatment of soil oil, landfill leachate, textile wastewater and antibiotics are summarized and prospected.







Abstract
The Fenton reaction refers to the reaction in which ferrous ions (Fe2+) produce hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxidizing substances by decomposing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This paper reviews the mechanism, application system, and materials employed in the Fenton reaction including conventional homogeneous and non&#8208;homogeneous Fenton reactions as well as photo&#8208;, electrically&#8208;, ultrasonically&#8208;, and piezoelectrically&#8208;triggered Fenton reactions, and summarizes the applications in the degradation of soil oil pollutions, landfill leachate, textile wastewater, and antibiotics from a practical point of view. The mineralization paths of typical pollutant are elucidated with relevant case studies. The paper concludes with a summary and outlook of the further development of Fenton&#8208;like reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Absorbing Bis&#8208;Donor Functionalized Aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives: Synthesis and Photophysical Study by Using Transient Optical Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated aza&#8208;BDP derivatives with various electron donors is designed, synthesized, and characterized. The impact of diverse electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties is examined through steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical analyses, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, and theoretical computations.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs=710&#8197;nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs=685&#8197;nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F=0.2&#8211;0.7&#8201;% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F=27&#8201;% in toluene). However, the apparent intersystem crossing ability of these compounds is poor, based on the singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=0.3&#8211;1.5&#8201;%). The ns&#8208;TA spectral study showed typical Bodipy localized triplet state transient features, short&#8208;lived excited triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#964;T=53.2&#8197;&#956;s) versus significantly long&#8208;lived triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#964;T=114 &#956;s) was observed under deaerated experimental conditions. These triplet state lifetimes are much longer than that obtained with diiodoAzaBDP (intramolecular heavy atom effect, &#964;T=1.5~7.2&#8197;&#956;s). These information are useful for molecular structure design of triplet photosensitizers, for which longer triplet state lifetimes are usually desired. Theoretical computations displayed that the triplet state is mainly localized on the AzaBDP core, moreover, it was found that the HOMO/LUMO energy gap decreased after introducing donor moieties to the skeleton as compared with the reference.

         <title>CO2 Photoreduction Over Semiconducting 2D Materials with Supported Single Atoms: Recent Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting 2D materials with supported single atoms combine the advantages of 2D structures with single&#8208;atom catalysts, offering increased light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transfer, electron localization at active sites, improved reactant adsorption and activation, etc. This review highlights their significant potential and recent advancements in CO2 photoreduction, while also identifying key challenges and delineating future research directions.







Abstract
In the face of the growing energy crisis and environmental challenges, substantial efforts are now directed toward sustainable clean energy as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels. CO2 photoreduction into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is widely recognized as a promising approach to mitigate current energy and environmental concerns. Photocatalysts comprising single atoms (SAs) supported on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials (SAs&#8208;2DSemi) have emerged as a novel frontier due to the combined merits of SA catalysts and 2D materials. In this study, we review advancements in metal SAs confined on 2DSemi substrates, categorized into four groups: (1) metal oxide&#8208;based, (2) g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based, (3) emerging, and (4) hybridized 2DSemi, for photocatalytic CO2 conversion over the past few years. With a particular focus on highlighting the distinct advantages of SAs&#8208;2DSemi, we delve into the synthesis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, their catalytic performances, and mechanistic elucidation facilitated by experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Following this, we outline the challenges in this field and offer perspectives on harnessing the potential of SAs&#8208;2DSemi as promising photocatalysts. This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights for the future development of 2D photocatalytic materials involving SAs for CO2 reduction.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced Generation of Aryl Radical and Applications: Generation of aryl radicals under photosensitized, photoinitiated, and direct or indirect photoredox&#8208;catalyzed conditions are reviewed. The utilization of aryl radicals in various reactions is demonstrated with examples.







Abstract
Photoinduced aryl radical generation is a powerful strategy in organic synthesis that facilitates the formation of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The synthetic applications of photoinduced aryl radical formation in the synthesis of complex organic compounds, including natural products, physiologically significant molecules, and functional materials, have received immense attention. An overview of current developments in photoinduced aryl radical production methods and their uses in organic synthesis is given in this article. A generalized idea of how to choose the reagents and approach for the generation of aryl radicals is described, along with photoinduced techniques and associated mechanistic insights. Overall, this article offers a critical assessment of the mechanistic results as well as the selection of reaction parameters for specific reagents in the context of radical cascades, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, aryl radical functionalization, and selective C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl substrates.

         <title>Identification of the Cirratiomycin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in Streptomyces Cirratus: Elucidation of the Biosynthetic Pathways for 2,3&#8208;Diaminobutyric Acid and Hydroxymethylserine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces cirratus by genome sequencing and gene inactivation. The biosynthesis of two nonproteinogenic amino acids was elucidated: (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (DABA) is synthesized from threonine by four enzymes, CirQ, CirR, CirS and CirB, and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine (HMSer) is synthesized from d&#8208;serine by CirH.







Abstract
Cirratiomycin, a heptapeptide with antibacterial activity, was isolated and characterized in 1981; however, its biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated. It contains several interesting nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid ((2S,3S)&#8208;DABA) and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine, as building blocks. Here, we report the identification of a cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several Streptomyces viridifaciens and Kitasatospora aureofaciens strains also have this cluster. One S. viridifaciens strain was confirmed to produce cirratiomycin. The biosynthetic gene cluster was shown to be responsible for cirratiomycin biosynthesis in S. cirratus in a gene inactivation experiment using CRISPR&#8208;cBEST. Interestingly, this cluster encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) composed of 12 proteins, including those with an unusual domain organization: a stand&#8208;alone adenylation domain, two stand&#8208;alone condensation domains, two type II thioesterases, and two NRPS modules that have no adenylation domain. Using heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA: (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA is synthesized from l&#8208;threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine from d&#8208;serine in&#8197;vitro. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.

         <title>A General Concept for the Electronic and Steric Modification of 1&#8208;Metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes: A Case Study of Group 4 Metallocene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes were prepared from suitable organolithium precursors. The effect of introduction of phenyl groups was studied using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. For the first time cyclic voltammetry, EPR, and solid state NMR spectroscopy were used to support structural and DFT data.







Abstract
The synthesis of group 4 metal 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes as organometallic analogues of elusive 1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene has so far been limited to SiMe3 substituted examples. We present the synthesis of two Ph substituted dilithiated ligand precursors for the preparation of four new 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M] (M=Ti, Zr; ebthi=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl)). The organolithium compounds [Li2(RC3Ph)] (1&#8201;b: R=Ph, 1&#8201;c: R=SiMe3) as well as the metallacycles of the general formula [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M(R1C3R2)] (2&#8201;b: M=Ti, R1=R2=Ph, 2&#8201;c: M=Ti, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3; 3&#8201;b: M=Zr, R1=R2=Ph; 3&#8201;c: M=Zr, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3) were fully characterised. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and quantum chemical bond analysis of the Ti and Zr complexes reveal ligand influence on the biradicaloid character of the titanocene complexes. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy of structurally similar Ti complexes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)Ti(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] (2&#8201;a), 2&#8201;b, and 2&#8201;c was carried out to evaluate the accessibility of an EPR active triplet state. Cyclic voltammetry shows that introduction of Ph groups renders the complexes easier to reduce. 13C CPMAS NMR analysis provides insights into the cause of the low field shift of the resonances of metal&#8208;bonded carbon atoms and provides evidence of the absence of the &#946;&#8722;C&#8722;Ti interaction.

         <title>64Cu tumor labeling with hexadentate picolinic acid&#8208;based bispidine immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional chelators based on bispidine picolinates allow rapid and efficient labeling with the positron emitter Cu&#8208;64 under mild conditions. The resulting 64CuII&#8208;labeled bispidine complexes exhibit high in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo stability. Isothiocyanate functionalization of bispidine picolinates in C9 position enables efficient coupling to targeting vector molecules. After 64CuII&#8208;labeling of target modules, tumor visualization by PET with high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio is obtained.







Abstract
Discussed are two picolinate appended bispidine ligands (3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives) in comparison with an earlier described bis&#8208;pyridine derivative, which are all known to strongly bind CuII. The radiopharmacological characterization of the two isomeric bispidine complexes includes quantitative labeling with 64CuII at ambient conditions with high radiochemical purities and yields (molar activities &gt;200&#8197;MBq/nmol). Challenge experiments in presence of EDTA, cyclam, human serum and SOD demonstrate high stability and inertness of the 64Cu&#8208;bispidine complexes. Biodistribution studies performed in Wistar rats indicate a rapid renal elimination for both 64Cu&#8208;labeled chelates. The bispidine ligand with the picolinate group in N7 position was selected for further biological experiments, and its backbone was therefore substituted with a benzyl&#8208;NCS group at C9. Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS&#8208;functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor&#8208;bearing mice showed specific accumulation of the 64Cu&#8208;labeled TMs in PSCA&#8208; and FAP&#8208;overexpressing tumors (standardized uptake value (SUV) for PC3: 2.7&#177;0.6 and HT1080: 7.2&#177;1.25) with almost no uptake in wild type tumors.

Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS-functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor-bearing mice showed specific accumulation of the &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-labeled TMs in PSCA- and FAP-overexpressing tumors (standardized uptake value (SUV) for PC3: 2.7&#177;0.6 and HT1080: 7.2&#177;1.25) with almost no uptake in wild type tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Increasing Dimensionality in Self&#8208;Assembly: Toward Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to attain 2D supramolecular polymers, following both a thermodynamic or a kinetic regime, are reviewed. The examples of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies and showing elegant applications.







Abstract
Different approaches to achieve 2D supramolecular polymers, as an alternative to the covalent bottom&#8208;up approaches reported for the preparation of 2D materials, are reviewed. The significance of the operation of weak non&#8208;covalent forces to induce a lateral growth of a number of self&#8208;assembling units is collected. The examples of both thermodynamically and kinetically controlled formation of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies (nanosheets, scrolls, porous surfaces) and showing elegant applications like chiral recognition, enantioselective uptake or asymmetric organic transformations. Furthermore, elaborated techniques like seeded or living supramolecular polymerizations have been demonstrated to give rise to complex 2D nanostructures.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bis&#8208;Norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ray of sunlight absorbed by a solution will be stored and later released as heat energy. The norbornadiene derivatives designed and studied in this work swirl around the flask like autumn leaves symbolizing the cyclic nature of molecular solar thermal energy storage; and as leaves turn red in autumn, so the absorption of these molecular switches is redshifted. The natural setting reflects the ultimate goal of providing a new, renewable way of storing energy, thereby protecting the environment and the climate.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Cationic Styryl Dyes in Vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a novel nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction between quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates, styryl dye libraries were successfully generated under mild conditions, and their optical properties information was simultaneously obtained. This powerful strategy, which is applicable both in&#8197;vitro and in living cells, enables the rapid discovery of styryl dyes with desirable characteristics that may find a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
A novel method for synthesizing cationic styryl dyes through a nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction has been developed. This approach overcomes issues associated with traditional synthesis methods, such as harsh conditions, low throughput, and wasteful chemicals. The presence of a nucleic acid template accelerated the styryl dye formation from quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates. These styryl dyes show remarkable optical properties change when bound to nucleic acids, hence the success of the synthesis could be readily monitored in&#8197;situ by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and the optical properties data were also observable at the same time. This method provides the desired products from a broad range of coupling partners. By employing different substrates and templates, it is possible to identify new dyes that can bind to a specific type of nucleic acid such as a G&#8208;quadruplex. The templated dye synthesis is also successfully demonstrated in live HeLa cells. This approach is a powerful tool for the rapid synthesis and screening of dyes specific for diverse types of nucleic acids or cellular organelles, facilitating new biological discoveries.

         <title>A Family of Hexacopper Phenylsilsesquioxane/Acetate Complexes: Synthesis, Solvent&#8208;Controlled Cage Structures, and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexacopper phenylsilsesquioxane/acetate complex exhibits high catalytic activity in (i) oxygenations of hydrocarbons, (ii) Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, and (iii) tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction, leading to lactone directly from cyclohexane







Abstract
Convenient self&#8208;assembly synthesis of copper(II) complexes via double (phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate) ligation allows to isolate a family of impressive sandwich&#8208;like cage compounds. An intriguing feature of these complexes is the difference in the structure of a pair of silsesquioxane ligands despite identical (Cu6) nuclearity and number (four) of acetate fragments. Formation of particular combination of silsesquioxane ligands (cyclic/cyclic vs condensed/condensed vs cyclic/condensed) was found to be dependent on the synthesis/crystallization media. A combination of Si4&#8208;cyclic and Si6&#8208;condensed silsesquioxane ligands is a brand new feature of cage metallasilsesquioxanes. A representative Cu6&#8208;complex (4) (with cyclic silsesquioxanes) exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols with peroxides. Maximum yield of the products of cyclohexane oxidation attained 30&#8201;%. The compound 4 was also tested as catalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone by m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid: maximum yields of 88&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% of &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone were achieved upon conventional heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h and MW irradiation at 70 or 80&#8201;&#176;C during 30&#8197;min, respectively. It was also possible to obtain the lactone (up to 16&#8201;% yield) directly from the cyclohexane via a tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction using the same oxidant.

         <title>Electronic Control of Polyproline II Helix Stability via the Identity of Acyl Capping Groups: the Pivaloyl Group Particularly Promotes PPII</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The type II polyproline helix (PPII) is a fundamental secondary structure of proteins. PPII is stabilized in part by n&#174;p* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron&#8208;donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron&#8208;acceptor carbonyl (p*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n&#174;p* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X&#8211;PPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides (X = 10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron&#8208;rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac&#8208;) group, with the pivaloyl and iso&#8208;butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X&#8211;APPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non&#8208;proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of olefins activated on highly Lewis&#8208;acidic calcium cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The report introduces simple yet highly reactive calcium salt, Ca[Al(ORF)4]2 (RF = C(CF3)3), 1, which effectively catalyses olefin hydrosilylation through an unusual mechanism involving the activation of the alkene molecule. Upon dissolution in o&#8208;difluorobenzene (oDFB), 1 forms a highly Lewis acidic [Ca(oDFB)6]2+ complex. Our DFT calculations reveal that fluoride ion affinity is comparable to SbF5. Reactivity tests show that it effectively catalyses the hydrosilylation of olefins with high regioselectivity, also in reactions involving sterically demanding substrates like (iPr)3SiH or tetrasubstituted olefins. Experimental and computational results point to the mechanism where the olefin molecule forms a complex with Ca2+, which significantly facilitates the attack of H&#8208;SiR3 on the C=C double bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Behaviour and Redox Potentials of Dyes in Aqueous Buffers and Protic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes hold promise as inexpensive electrochemically&#8208;active building blocks for new renewable energy technologies such as redox&#8208;flow batteries and dye&#8208;sensitised solar cells, especially if they display high oxidation and/or low reduction potentials in cheap, non&#8208;flammable solvents such as water or protic ionic liquids. Systematic computational and experimental characterisation of a representative selection of acidic and basic dyes in buffered aqueous solutions and propylammonium formate confirm that quinoid&#8208;type mechanisms impart electrochemical reversibility for the majority of systems investigated, including quinones, fused tricyclic heteroaromatics, indigo carmine and some aromatic nitrogenous species. Conversely, systems that generate long&#8208;lived radical intermediates &#8208;&#8208; arylmethanes, hydroquinones at high pH, azocyclic systems &#8208;&#8208; tend to display irreversible electrochemistry, likely undergoing ring&#8208;opening, dimerisation and/or disproportionation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clathrate hydrates are among the most intensively studied H&#8208;bond inclusion compounds. Despite the broad definition for this class of compounds, their meaning commonly refers to closed polyhedral nanocages that encapsulate small guest molecules. On the other hand, larger solutes enforce another type of encapsulation because of the solute size effect. Herein, we report a series of structures containing various molecules encapsulated by intercalated water layers constructed of polycyclic moieties of L4(4)8(8) topology. We parametrized the corrugation of individual layers and characterized interactions governing their formation. We suggested which could be categorized as two&#8208;dimensional clathrates based on the character of intra&#8208;layer interactions and effects observed between entrapped molecules and water&#8208;based intercalators.</dc:description>

         <title>A Halogen Bonding [2]Rotaxane Shuttle for Chloride&#8208;Selective Optical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic halogen bonding multi&#8208;station [2]rotaxane displays a selective optical response to chloride over bromide and iodide anions. Chloride binding induces a translocation of the isophthalamide&#8208;functionalised macrocycle from the naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations to the halogen bonding station, leading to a reduction in the donor&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer absorption arising from macrocycle&#8208;NDI interactions, whereas the larger halides are excluded from the interlocked cavity.







Abstract
The first example of a [2]rotaxane shuttle capable of selective optical sensing of chloride anions over other halides is reported. The rotaxane was synthesised via a chloride ion template&#8208;directed cyclisation of an isophthalamide macrocycle around a multi&#8208;station axle containing peripheral naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations and a halogen bonding (XB) bis(iodotriazole) based station. Proton NMR studies indicate the macrocycle resides preferentially at the NDI stations in the free rotaxane, where it is stabilised by aromatic donor&#8208;acceptor charge transfer interactions between the axle NDI and macrocycle hydroquinone moieties. Addition of chloride ions in an aqueous&#8208;acetone solvent mixture induces macrocycle translocation to the XB anion binding station to facilitate the formation of convergent XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&#8722; and hydrogen bonding HB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&#8722; interactions, which is accompanied by a reduction of the charge&#8208;transfer absorption band. Importantly, little to no optical response was induced by addition of bromide or iodide to the rotaxane, indicative of the size discriminative steric inaccessibility of the interlocked cavity to the larger halides, demonstrating the potential of using the mechanical bond effect as a potent strategy and tool in chloride&#8208;selective chemo&#8208;sensing applications in aqueous containing solvent environments.

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review paper features the use of ionic liquids in tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. We aim to give the readers some general context of the structure and properties of ionic liquids because it is the ground for shaping the electrolyte. Furthermore, the characterization techniques and results are discussed.







Abstract
Ionic liquids are an extraordinary group of compounds, fully ionic in structure like inorganic salts but with low melting points, that resemble organic molecular solvents. Their chemical, electrochemical, and thermal stability is what draws the attention and enables their use in many applications, including electrochemical power sources. Even though they are no longer considered eco&#8208;friendly because of nonnegligible toxicity and long bioaccumulation, they can still be efficiently recovered, purified, and reused. These attributes can be harvested to enhance the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The variety of anions and cations for ILs and their influence on the final properties of the compound opens the road to tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes. Ionic liquids as plasticizers constitute a major part of gel polymer electrolytes (average of 70&#8197;wt%) and hence, they affect the fundamental properties of gel electrolytes like ionic conductivity and electrochemical window. They also improve the safety features of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is relevant for their anticipated applications in stationary energy storage and electric vehicles. The presented review paper aims to explain the relationship between the cation and anion in ionic liquid and the properties of gel electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

They also improve the safety features of sodium-ion batteries, which is relevant for their anticipated applications in stationary energy storage and electric vehicles. The presented review paper aims to explain the relationship between the cation and anion in ionic liquid and the properties of gel electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thiolate&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid Catalysts for Reduction of CO2: Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Amines to Form N&#8208;Formamides and N&#8208;Methylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid is a novel type of catalyst that utilizes sulfur as the active center in an ionic liquid. It exhibits diverse functionalities in activating hydrogenated silane and amine, leading to ultra&#8208;high catalytic activity in the reductive functionalization of CO2 with amines and hydrosilane. By controlling the CO2 pressure, it enables selective synthesis of varied formamides and methylamines with high yields.







Abstract
Developing efficient catalysts to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals is valuable for reducing carbon emissions. Herein, a kind of novel thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid with sulfur as the active site was designed and synthesized, which served as highly efficient catalyst for the reductive N&#8208;functionalization of CO2 by amines and hydrosilane. By adjusting the CO2 pressure, various N&#8208;formamides and N&#8208;methylamines were selectively obtained in high yields. Remarkably, at the catalyst loading of 0.1&#8197;mol %, the N&#8208;formylation reaction of N&#8208;methylaniline exhibited an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) up to 600&#8197;h&#8722;1, which could be attributed to the roles of the ionic liquids in activating hydrosilane and amine. In addition, control experiments and NMR monitoring experiments provided evidence that the reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane yielded formoxysilane intermediates that subsequently reacted with amines to form N&#8208;formylated products. Alternatively, the formoxysilane intermediates could further react with hydrosilane and amine to produce 4&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced aminal products. These aminal products served as crucial intermediates in the N&#8208;methylation reactions.

         <title>Robust Red&#8208;Absorbing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;property guidelines are disclosed for creating robust donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) photochromes. A comprehensive investigation has revealed that a DASA photochrome with a low degree of charge separation is desired to achieve a robust, reversible photoswitching. Other indirect factors that could modulate the DASA photoswitching in polymer thin films are also discussed in detail.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct (DASA), a class of push&#8208;pull negative photochrome, has received large interest lately owing to its versatile synthesis, modularity and excellent photoswitching in solutions. From a technological perspective, it is imperative for this class of photoswitches to work robustly in solid state, e.&#8201;g. thin films. We feature a molecular framework for the optimized design of DASAs by introducing a new thioindoline donor (D3) and assessing its performance against known 2nd generation indoline&#8208;based donors. The systematic structure&#8208;function investigations suggest that to achieve robust reversible photoswitching, a ground state with low charge separation is desired. DASAs with stronger electron donors and a larger charge separation in the ground state result in a low population of the photothermalstationary state (PTSS) and reduced photostability. The DASA with thioindoline donor (D3A3) seems to be a special case among the donor series as it causes a red shift (ca. 15&#8197;nm), however with less polarization of the ground state and marginally better photostability as compared to the unsubstituted 2&#8208;methyl indoline (D1A3). We also emphasize the consideration of the key additional factors that can modulate the red&#8208;light photoswitching properties of DASA chromophores in polymer thin films, which might not be dominant in homogenous solution state.

Two hands holding a molecule hint at chirality, which exists in three dimensions from the macro&#8208; to the micro&#8208;world. A new type of chirality is generated by rotating three functional groups to different orientations along an axis. An energy curve shows that there are three relatively stable conformations. Beams of light show the molecules can provide polarized light for future research and applications in materials science. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Jiao, G.

         <title>Conformational and Electronic Variations in 1,2&#8208; and 1,5a&#8208;Cyclophellitols and their Impact on Retaining &#945;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty configurational and functional cyclophellitol analogues were synthesized and evaluated on their potency as retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors. The inhibitory properties of the focused library of compounds were determined on human &#945;&#8208;glucosidases after which we mapped the conformational free energy landscapes of the most active compounds. Our results add to the growing list of covalent and competitive &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors and may pave the way towards the design of new therapeutics targeting these enzymes.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (glycosidases) take part in myriad biological processes and are important therapeutic targets. Competitive and mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors are useful tools to dissect their biological role and comprise a good starting point for drug discovery. The natural product, cyclophellitol, a mechanism&#8208;based, covalent and irreversible retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor has inspired the design of diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosidase inhibitor and activity&#8208;based probe scaffolds. Here, we sought to deepen our understanding of the structural and functional requirements of cyclophellitol&#8208;type compounds for effective human &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition. We synthesized a comprehensive set of &#945;&#8208;configured 1,2&#8208; and 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitol analogues bearing a variety of electrophilic traps. The inhibitory potency of these compounds was assessed towards both lysosomal and ER retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidases. These studies revealed the 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitols to be the most potent retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors, with the nature of the electrophile determining inhibitory mode of action (covalent or non&#8208;covalent). DFT calculations support the ability of the 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitols, but not the 1,2&#8208;congeners, to adopt conformations that mimic either the Michaelis complex or transition state of &#945;&#8208;glucosidases.

         <title>Driving Triplet State Population in Benzothioxanthene Imide Dyes: Let's Twist!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an accessible chemical modification, a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion was induced in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone of a benzothioxanthene imide (BTI). This simple yet effective strategy was used to manipulate triplet formation with ease and to rationalize the closely intertwined connection between spin&#8211;orbit coupling, twisting of the &#960;&#8208;system and intersystem crossing. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Monnereau, C. Cabanetos, T. Le&#8197;Bahers and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400191).

This simple yet effective strategy was used to manipulate triplet formation with ease and to rationalize the closely intertwined connection between spin&#8211;orbit coupling, twisting of the &#960;-system and intersystem crossing.

Le&#8197;Bahers and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202400191"&gt;10.1002/chem.202400191&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient structured film has been fabricated through photopolymerization&#8208;induced diffusion. First, illumination with low&#8208;intensity UV light initiates the thiol&#8208;ene reaction only at the surface, and this triggers the diffusion of thiol molecules to the surface. Then, illumination with blue light initiates chain&#8208;growth acrylate homopolymerization, which arrests the spatial gradient of crosslink density. Due to its gradient structure, the film exhibits bending actuation both in air and solvent. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400515).

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Pyrazoles via Manganese Pincer Complex Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report detailed the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reaction catalyzed by a well&#8208;defined manganese(I)&#8208;pincer complex. Symmetrically substituted pyrazoles were synthesized by reacting 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. Unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were selectively made via the ADC of primary alcohols with methyl hydrazones. Water and hydrogen are liberated as the green byproducts. The endurance of these methodologies has been presented by producing 30 substrates with varied functionalities. Model reactions were scaled up to demonstrate practicability. The reaction rate and order were measured to transparent the involvement of the reagents during catalysis. Control experiments elucidated the plausible reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Afterglow Performance of Phenylenevinylene&#8208;Based Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles Doped with Photosensitizers Containing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is usually believed that doping with photosensitizers capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the afterglow performance of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). However, the effect of doping photosensitizer bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups&#160;has not been reported. Here we report the effect of doping with six photosensitizers possessing different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the afterglow performance of SPNs using poly[(9,9&#8208;di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluo&#8208;rene&#8208;2,7&#8208;vinylene)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyloxy)&#8208;2,5&#8208;phenylenevinylene)] (PF&#8208;MEHPPV) as substrate. It was found that the afterglow performance of SPNs was significantly influenced by doping with photosensitizers bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2&#160;generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs. This work deepens the understanding of the design and synthesis of SPNs with different afterglow properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Flexdispersion: Structure&#8211;Function Relationship Studies of Organic Amphiphilic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since inorganic nanoparticles have unique properties that differ from bulk materials, their material applications have attracted attention in various fields. In order to utilize inorganic nanoparticles for functional materials, they must be dispersed without agglomeration. Therefore, the surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles are typically modified with organic ligands to improve their dispersibility. Nevertheless, the relationship between the tail group structure in organic ligands and the dispersibility of inorganic nanoparticles in organic solvents remains poorly understood. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. However, the structural requirements for amphiphilic ligands to &#8220;flexibly&#8221; disperse nanoparticles in less polar to polar solvents are still unclear. Here, we designed and synthesized several phosphonic acid ligands for structure&#8210;function relationship studies of flexdispersion. Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements revealed that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains in organic ligands alone does not determine the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in organic solvents, but the arrangement of the individual chains also has an effect. From a practical application standpoint, it is preferable to design ligands with ethylene glycol chains on the outside relative to the particle surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State NMR Study of the Imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, being only the second representative of this compound class, was synthesized ammonothermally at 870 K and 230 MPa. Its crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The imidonitridosilicate crystallizes isotypically with the respective potassium compound in space group P4132 with the lattice parameter a = 10.9422(4) &#197; forming a three&#8208;dimensional imidonitridosilicate tetrahedra network with voids for the rubidium ions. The structure model and the presence of the imide groups were verified by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, using cross polarization 15N{1H} and 29Si{1H} MAS NMR experiments. Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 represents a possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates. The characterization of these intermediates improves the understanding of the reaction pathway from ammonothermal solutions to nitrides. Thus, the ammonothermal synthesis is an alternative approach to the well&#8208;established high&#8208;temperature synthesis leading to the compound class of nitridosilicates.</dc:description>

         <title>Pronounced Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism in Anisidine Amino Acid Diamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergent properties resulting from selective supramolecular interactions are of significant importance for materials and chemical systems. For the directed use of such properties, a fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism and the resulting mode of function is necessary for a tailored design. The self&#8208;induced diastereomeric anisochronism effect (SIDA), which occurs in the intermolecular interaction of chiral molecules, generates unique properties such as chiral self&#8208;recognition and nonlinear effects. Here we show that anisidine amino acid diamides lead to extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition. By systematic experiments we have investigated the underlying SIDA effect, explored its limits and finally successfully utilized it in the determination of enantiomeric ratios by NMR spectroscopy of chiral &#8216;SIDA&#8208;inactive&#8217; compounds such as thalidomide.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylenes: Monomeric Silanechalcogenones, Silanimines, Silirenes, and Insertion Products with P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stable ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes fc[(N{B})2Si] (A; fc = 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene, {B} = (HCNDipp)2B, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and fc[(NDipp)2Si] (B) are compared in a study focussing on their reactivity towards a range of small to moderately sized molecular substrates, viz. P4, S8, Se8, MesN3 (Mes = mesityl), RC&#8801;CH, and RC&#8801;CR (R = Ph, SiMe3). The Dipp&#8208;substituted congener B exhibits a more pronounced ambiphilicity and is sterically less congested than its 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl&#8208;substituted relative A, in line with the higher reactivity of the former. The difference in reactivity is obviously due more to electronic than to steric reasons, as is illustrated by the fact that both A and B react with the comparatively bulky substrate MesN3 under mild conditions to afford the corresponding silanimine fc[(N{B})2Si=NMes] and fc[(NDipp)2Si=NMes], respectively. The heavier ketone analogues fc[(N{B})2Si=E] (E = S, Se, Te) are readily available from A and the corresponding chalcogen. In contrast, the reaction of the more reactive silylene B with elemental sulfur or selenium is unspecific, affording product mixtures. However, fc[(NDipp)2Si=Se] is selectively prepared from B and (Et2N)3PSe; the Te analogue is also accessible, but crystallises as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting Manganese Amidinates and &#223;&#8208;Ketoiminates Complexes as Precursors for Mn&#8208;Based Thin Film Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With a focus on Mn based organometallic compounds with suitable physico&#8208;chemical properties to serve as precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Mn&#8208;containing materials, systematic synthetic approaches with ligand variation, detailed characterization, and theoretical input from density functional theory (DFT) studies are presented. A series of new homoleptic all&#8208;nitrogen and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn(II) complexes bearing the acetamidinate, formamidinate, guanidinate and &#223;&#8208;ketoiminate ligands have been successfully synthesized for the first time. The specific choice of these ligand classes with changes in structure and coordination sphere and side chain variations result in significant structural differences whereby mononuclear and dinuclear complexes are formed. This was supported by density functional theory (DFT) studies. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. To evaluate their suitability as precursors for deposition of Mn&#8208;based materials, the thermal properties were investigated in detail. Mn(II) complexes possessing the most promising thermal properties, namely Bis(N,N&#180;&#8208;ditertbutylformamidinato)manganese(II) (IV) and Bis(4&#8208;(isopropylamino)pent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;onato)manganese(II) (&#223;III) were used in reactivity studies with DFT to explore their interaction with oxidizing co&#8208;reactants such as oxygen and water which will guide future CVD and ALD process development.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl Conversion: From Closed&#8208;Cubane Photosystem II to Mn(V) Catalysts and the Role of the Entering Ligands.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low activation barrier for O&#8208;O coupling in the closed&#8208;cubane Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Centre (OEC) of Photosystem II (PSII) requires water coordination with the Mn4 'dangler' ion in the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo fragment. This coordination transforms the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo into a more reactive Mn4(IV)&#8208;oxyl species, enhancing O&#8208;O coupling. This study explains the mechanism behind this and indicates that in the most stable form of the OEC, the Mn4 fragment adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry but needs to transition to a square pyramidal form to be activated for O&#8208;O coupling. This transition stabilizes the Mn4 dxy orbital, enabling electron transfer from the oxo ligand to the dxy orbital, converting the oxo ligand into an oxyl species. The role of the water is to coordinate with the square pyramidal structure, reducing the energy gap between the oxo and oxyl forms, thereby lowering the activation energy for O&#8208;O coupling. This mechanism applies not only to the OEC system but also to other Mn(V)&#8208;based catalysts. For other catalysts, ligands like OH&#8208; stabilize the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl species better than water, improving catalyst activation for reactions like C&#8208;H bond activation. This study is the first to explain the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl conversion, providing new foundation for Mn&#8208;based catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclopropanation of Active Methylene Derivatives Based on FeCl2 or FeCl3&#8208;Promoted Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were studied for the intramolecular cyclopropanation of active methylene derivatives. In the presence of FeCl3 as a stoichiometric oxidant and K2HPO4 as a base, the dehydrogenative cyclopropanation of active methylenes proceeded through the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization followed by the ionic cyclization to give the bicyclic cyclopropanes. The use of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes leads the subcatalytic cyclopropanation involving two redox pathways. In the presence of K2HPO4, the redox cyclopropanation proceeded by using FeCl2 (20 mol%) in combination with ligand (20 mol%).</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Electrolytes: Design Principles and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Today, rechargeable batteries are omnipresent and essential for our existence. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of electric fields, the introduction of electrolytes with fluorine (F)&#8208;based inorganic elemental compositions is a direction of exploration. However, most fluorocarbons have a high global warming potential and ozone depletion potential, which do not meet the sustainability requirements of the battery industry. Therefore, developing sustainable electrolytes is a viable option for future battery development. Although researchers have made much progress in electrolyte optimization, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. This review aims to elucidate the design principles and recent advances in this direction for solvents and salts. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of green electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Blue Photo&#8208; and Electroluminescence from CF3&#8208;Decorated Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organometallic complexes of earth&#8208;abundant copper(I) have long been studied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). Particularly, Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have recently emerged as promising organometallic emitters. However, blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA complexes have been rarely reported. Here we constructed two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA emitters, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz and MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz, by introducing one or two CF3&#8208; substitutes into carbazole ligands. Both complexes exhibited high thermal stability and blue emission colors. Moreover, two complexes exhibited different emission origins rooting from different donor ligands: a distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz or a dominant phosphorescence nature from local triplet excited state of the carbazole ligand for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz. Inspiringly, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz had high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 94% and short emission lifetimes of down to 1.2 &#956;s in doped films, accompanied by relatively high radiative rates in the 105 s&#8722;1 order. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz delivered pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 462 nm together with a high external quantum efficiency of 13.0%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocontrolled Binding of Styrylnaphthyridine Ligands to Abasic Site&#8208;Containing DNA by Reversible [2+2] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrylnaphthyridine derivatives are shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA). The ligand can be formed from its photodimer in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a promising tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder.







Abstract
Five novel styrylnaphthyridine derivatives were synthesized and shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA), which is an important therapeutic and diagnostic target. These compounds associate with AP&#8208;DNA with binding constants of 0.5&#8211;8.4&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 as shown by photometric and fluorimetric titrations. Specifically, these ligands bind preferentially to AP&#8208;DNA relative to regularly paired duplex DNA. As a special feature, the association of these ligands with DNA can be controlled by means of a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition. Upon irradiation at 420&#8197;nm the photodimer is formed, which does not bind to AP&#8208;DNA. In turn, the naphthyridine is regained with excitation at 315&#8197;nm. Most notably, this photoinduced deactivation and release of the DNA ligand can be performed in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder. Overall, these results provide a promising starting point for the development of functional AP&#8208;DNA ligands whose bioactivity can be modulated by light with local and temporal control.

         <title>New Phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole&#8208;Based Fluorophores with Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics for Highly Efficient Blue Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs with Negligible Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole&#8208;cored blue fluorophore with HLCT feature was reported. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped pure blue OLEDs demonstrated the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with the maximum EQE of 7.99&#8201;% accompanied with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, even maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
It is vital to develop highly efficient non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off for applications in display and lighting. Herein, two blue D&#8208;A fluorophores TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO are designed and synthesized, in which phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole (PO) acts as the acceptor and triphenylamine as the donor. TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO display good thermal stability and efficient luminescence efficiency in neat film. Results based on photophysical property and theoretical calculation demonstrate that TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO possess the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, which can utilize the triplet exciton to achieve highly efficient electroluminance (EL). The non&#8208;doped OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PO/TPA&#8208;DPO as pure emissive layer show the uniform EL emission peak at 468&#8197;nm, corresponding to CIE coordinates of (0.168, 0.187) and (0.167, 0.167), respectively. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs provide the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.99&#8201;% and high exciton utility efficiency of 48.4&#8201;%~72.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based device exhibits low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off, still maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Those findings state clearly that PO is a promising building block of blue fluorophore with a potential HLCT feature to be applied in non&#8208;doped OLEDs.

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Driven Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex (EDA) complex&#8208;based method for trifluoromethylating heterocycles, bypassing traditional photocatalysts and oxidants. Utilizing 395&#8197;nm light, it efficiently produces trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. The research emphasizes EDA photoactivation&#8216;s crucial role, thoroughly documented through experimental, mechanistic, and spectroscopic analyses, thereby expanding EDA complexes&#8242; utility in chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Heterocyclic trifluoromethylation is efficiently initiated through a photochemical reaction utilizing an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, proceeding smoothly without the use of photocatalysts, transition&#8208;metal catalysts, or additional oxidants. This method has been optimized through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its versatility and efficacy across various substrates, including quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. Notably, this approach enables the practical synthesis of trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones on a gram scale. Mechanistic investigations that incorporate radical trapping and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, confirmed the formation of the an EDA complex and elucidated the reaction pathways. This study highlights the crucial role of EDA photoactivation in trifluoromethylation, significantly expanding the application scope of EDA complexes in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Structure and Chiroptical Properties of Anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl Dimers as New Biaryls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomers of the title biaryl with one chiral axis and two helical moieties were resolved by chiral HPLC. Their chiroptical activities were evaluated by dissymmetry factors of the CD and CPL spectra. A stepwise mechanism of enantiomerization via rotation about the chiral axis was proposed by the DFT calculations.







Abstract
Dimers of anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl units and its mesityl derivative were synthesized by Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the corresponding chloro derivatives as new biaryls. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed that two polycyclic aromatic units with nonplanar deformations took a twisted conformation about the single bond as a chiral axis. Enantiomers of the nonsubstituted compound were resolved by chiral HPLC, and the enantiopure samples showed intense Cotton effects at 321&#8197;nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and emission bands at 449&#8197;nm in the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra with dissymmetry factor of |glum| 3.6&#215;10&#8722;3. The absolute stereochemistry of this biaryl was determined by the theoretical calculation of CD spectrum by the time&#8208;dependent DFT method. The barrier to enantiomerization was determined to be 108&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K. The dynamic process proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving the helical inversion of each aromatic unit and the rotation about the biaryl axis as analyzed by the DFT calculations.

         <title>Application of Mono and Trinuclear Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complexes in Differential Bacterial Imaging and Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of transition metal complexes for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an attractive alternative in mitigating a broad range of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In view of their photostability, long excited&#8208;state lifetimes, and tunable emission properties, transition metal complexes also contribute as bioimaging agents. In the present work, we designed mono and trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes to explore their imaging application and antibacterial potential.&#160; For this, we used Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the most prevalent of community&#8208;associated (CA) multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria (CA MDR) and Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) as Gram&#8208;positive while Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and E. coli as Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In addition to differential bioimaging of these bacteria, we assessed the antibacterial effects of both mono and trinuclear Ir(III) complexes under exposure to 427 nm LED light. The data presented herein strongly suggest better efficacy of trinuclear Ir(III) complex over mononuclear complex in imparting photoinduced cell death of MRSA. Based on the safety profile of these complexes, we propose that trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complex hold great promise for selective recognition and targeting MDR bacteria with minimal off&#8208;target effect.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we introduce a metal&#8208;free, catalytic and enantioselective strategy from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles to the&#160;chiral phosphorous 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Interestingly, this methodology was catalyzed by the classical and commercial oxazaborolidine under mild conditions. This strategy features a wide range of substrates scope&#160;with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The possible mechanism further suggests the key of this reaction through the cleavage of diarylphosphine oxides using Frustrated Lewis Pairs theory.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The two electrophotocatalytic reactions and the indirect electrolysis one are both regioselective and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208; and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and are associated with a broad substrate scope and high Se&#8208;economy, and all three methods are amenable to gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, sunlight&#8208;induced experiments and all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Upconversion in Mononuclear Lanthanide Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we developed two kinds of co&#8208;crystal assemblies systems, consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb3+ and Er3+ and mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+, which can achieve Er3+ and Pr3+ upconversion luminescence, respectively, by Yb3+ sensitization under 980 nm excitation. The structure and composition of two co&#8208;crystal assemblies were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. By investigation of the series of two assemblies, respectively, it is found that the strongest upconversion luminescence is both obtained when the molar ratio of Yb3+ and Ln3+ (Ln = Er or Pr) is 1 : 1. The energy transfer mechanism of Er3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion, while that of Pr3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion and cooperative sensitization upconversion. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension at room temperature, which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer (CT) crystals exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties with interesting applications. We present a rational and easy guide which allows to foresee the effective charge transfer co&#8208;crystal production and that is based on the comparison of the frontier molecular orbital (MO) energies of a donor and acceptor couple. For the sake of comparison, theoretical calculations have been carried out by using the cheap and fast PM6 semiempirical Hamiltonian and pure HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ level of the theory. The results are then compared with experimental results obtained both by chemical (bromine and iodine were used as the acceptor) and electrochemical doping (exploiting an original experimental set&#8208;up by this laboratory: the electrochemical transistor). Infra&#8208;red vibrational experimental results and theoretically calculated spectra are compared to assess both the effective donor&#8208;acceptor (D/A) charge&#8208;transfer and transport mechanism (giant IRAV polaron signature). XPS spectra have been collected (carbon (1s) and iodine (3d5/2)) signals, yielding further evidence of the effective formation of the CT anthracene:iodine complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites for Glioma Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanocomposites, camouflaged by cell membranes, exosomes or other bio&#8208;membranes, exhibit exceptional characteristics that facilitate efficient and precise delivery of contrast agents or drugs to glioma sites. These biomimetic nanocomposites are promising in glioma imaging and therapy, including fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multimodal imaging, as well as chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy.







Abstract
Glioma, the most common primary brain tumor, is highly invasive and grows rapidly. As such, the survival of glioma patients is relatively short, highlighting the vital importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of glioma. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the non&#8208;targeting delivery systems of contrast agents and drugs greatly hinder the effective glioma imaging and therapy. Fortunately, in recent years, investigators have constructed various biomimetic delivery platforms utilizing the exceptional advantages of biomimetic nanocomposites, such as immune evasion, homologous targeting ability, and BBB penetrating ability, to achieve efficient and precise delivery of substances to glioma sites for improved diagnosis and treatment. In this concept, we present the application of these biomimetic nanocomposites in fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multi&#8208;modal imaging, as well as in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy for glioma. Lastly, we provide our perspective on this research field.

         <title>Detection and Characterization of Hydride Ligands in Copper Complexes by Hard X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal complexes, particularly copper hydrides, play an important role in various catalytic processes and molecular inorganic chemistry. This study employs synchrotron hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to gain insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydrides as potential catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The potential of high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (HERFD&#8208;XANES) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission (VtC&#8208;XES) is demonstrated with measurement on Stryker's reagent (Cu6H6) and [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;H)(dpmppe)2](PF6)2 (Cu3H), alongside a non&#8208;hydride copper compound (Cu&#8208;I). The XANES analysis reveals that coordination geometries strongly influence the spectra, providing only indirect details about hydride coordination. The VtC&#8208;XES analysis exhibits a distinct signal around 8975 eV, offering a diagnostic tool to identify hydride ligands. Theoretical calculations support and extend these findings by comparing hydride&#8208;containing complexes with their hydride&#8208;free counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthetic Access to Stable Isotope Labelled Pseudouridine Phosphoramidites for RNA NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the efficient synthetic access to 13C/15N&#8208;labelled pseudouridine phosphoramidites, which were incorporated into a binary H/ACA box guide RNA/product complex comprising 77 nucleotides (nts) in total and into a 75 nt E. coli tRNAGly. The stable isotope (SI) labelled pseudouridines were produced via a highly efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis. 13C/15N labelled uracils were produced via chemical synthesis and enzymatically converted to 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate pseudouridine (&#936;MP) by using YeiN, a &#936;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate C&#8208;glycosidase. Removal of the 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate group yielded the desired pseudouridine nucleoside (&#936;), which was transformed into a phosphoramidite building suitable for RNA solid phase synthesis. A &#936; &#8208;building block carrying both a 13C and a 15N label was incorporated into a product RNA and the complex formation with a 63 nt H/ACA box RNA could be observed via NMR. Furthermore, the SI labelled pseudouridine building block was used to determine imino proton bulk water exchange rates of a 75 nt E. coli tRNAGly CCmnm5U, identifying the T&#936;C&#8208;loop 5&#8208;methyluridine as a modifier of the exchange rates. The efficient synthetic access to SI labelled &#936; building blocks will allow the solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic studies of &#936; containing RNAs and will facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis of &#936;&#8208;modified nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Basicity and Nucleophilicity of Organosodium Reagents in Benzylic C&#8208;H Additions of Toluenes to Diarylethenes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Profiting from the dual&#160;high basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium complexes, here we report the stepwise lateral metalation of a wide range of alkyl arenes (MeAr), mediated by hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble&#160;NaCH2SiMe3.PMDETA (PMDETA =&#160;N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine),&#160;followed by nucleophilic addition to olenfins of the newly generated&#160;NaCH2Ar.PMDETA complexes. This method grants access to a range of&#160;functionalised&#160;hydrocarbons in excellent yields and can be upgraded to catalytic regimes when using&#160;trans&#8208;stilbene, a 10 mol% of the alkyl sodium base and toluene as a solvent. Extending this approach to aromatic ketones leads to the formation of stilbenes under mild reaction conditions, resulting from the deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones. Combining spectroscopic studies with the trapping and&#160;characterisation&#160;of key reaction intermediates, mechanistic insights have been gained, advancing the understanding of coordination effects in organosodium chemistry, and shedding light on their special reactivity profiles.</dc:description>

A simple, effective, direct, and environmentally benign but unprecedented high mutual separation efficiency for Nd and Pr from their oxide mixture with &#946;Nd/Pr&gt;500 by selective dissolution in water equilibrated C4mim.NTf2 ionic liquid containing TTA.







Abstract
A simple, efficient, direct and economical method for the mutual separation of Nd and Pr was developed by the selective dissolution of Nd2O3 from their oxide mixtures in an ionic liquid containing 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) resulting in an unprecedented separation factor (&#946;Nd/Pr)&gt;500, which is 277&#8197;times more than the thus far reported &#946;Nd/Pr values. The proposed mechanism was supported by DFT computations.

         <title>Pathway Selection in Temporal Evolution of Supramolecular Polymers of Ionic &#960;&#8208;systems: Amphiphilic Organic Solvent Dictates the Fate of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding solvent&#8208;solute interactions is essential to designing and synthesising soft materials with tailor&#8208;made functions. Although the interaction of the solute with the solvent mixture is more complex than the single solvent medium, solvent mixtures are exciting to unfold several unforeseen phenomena in supramolecular chemistry. Here we report two unforeseen pathways observed during the hierarchical assembly of cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in a water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixtures. When the aqueous supramolecular polymers (SPs) of cPDIs are injected into AOS, initially kinetically trapped short SPs are formed, which gradually transform into thermodynamically stable high aspect ratio SP networks. Using various experimental and theoretical investigations, we found that this temporal evolution follows two distinct pathways depending on the nature of the water&#8208;AOS interactions. If the AOS is isopropanol (IPA), water is released from cPDIs into bulk IPA due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which further decreases the monomer concentration of cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;1). In the case of dioxane AOS, cPDIs monomer concentration further increases as water is retained among cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;2) due to relatively weak interactions between dioxane and water. Interestingly, these two pathways are accelerated by external stimuli such as heat and mechanical agitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Cycles: Saponification&#8208;Enhanced NMR Fingerprint Matching for the Identification and Stereochemical Evaluation of Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides from Natural Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We previously described NMR based fingerprint matching with peptide backbone resonances as a fast and reliable structural dereplication approach for Pseudomonas cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs). In combination with total synthesis of a small library of configurational CLiP congeners this also allows unambiguous determination of stereochemistry, facilitating structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and enabling three&#8208;dimensional structure determination. However, the on&#8208;resin macrocycle formation in the synthetic workflow brings considerable burden and limits universal applicability. This drawback is here removed altogether by also transforming the native CLiP into a linearized analogue by controlled saponification of the ester bond. This eliminates the need for macrocycle formation, limiting the synthesis effort to linear peptide analogues. NMR fingerprints of such linear peptide analogues display a sufficiently distinctive chemical shift fingerprint to act as effective discriminators. The approach is developed using viscosin group CLiPs and subsequently demonstrated on putisolvin, leading to a structural revision, and tanniamide from Pseudomonas ekonensis COR58, a newly isolated lipododecapeptide that defines a new group characterized by a ten&#8208;residue large macrocycle, the largest to date in the Pseudomonas CLiP portfolio. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the saponification&#8208; enhanced approach that broadens applicability of NMR fingerprint matching for the determination of the stereochemistry of CLiPs.</dc:description>

         <title>High pressure promotes binding of the allosteric inhibitor Zn2+&#8208;cyclen in crystals of activated H&#8208;Ras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we experimentally investigate the potency of high pressure to drive a protein toward an excited state where an inhibitor targeted for this state can bind. Ras proteins are small GTPases cycling between active GTP&#8208;bound and inactive GDP&#8208;bound states. Various states of GTP&#8208;bound Ras in active conformation coexist in solution, amongst them, state 2 which binds to effectors, and state 1, weakly populated at ambient conditions, which has a low affinity for effectors. Zn2+&#8208;cyclen is an allosteric inhibitor of Ras protein, designed to bind specifically to the state 1. In H&#8208;Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp crystals soaked with Zn2+&#8208;cyclen, no binding could be observed, as expected in the state 2 conformation which is the dominant state at ambient pressure. Interestingly, Zn2+&#8208;cyclen binding is observed at 500 MPa pressure, close to the nucleotide, in Ras protein that is driven by pressure to a state 1 conformer. The unknown binding mode of Zn2+&#8208;cyclen to H&#8208;Ras can thus be fully characterized in atomic details. As a more general conjunction from our study, high pressure x&#8208;ray crystallography turns out to be a powerful method to induce transitions allowing drug binding in proteins that are in low&#8208;populated conformations at ambient conditions, enabling the design of specific inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Case&#8208;Study on the Photophysics of Chalcogen&#8208;Substituted Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully systematic analysis of the effect of chalcogen atoms on the photophysical properties (absorption and fluorescence spectra, excited state lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration) of 30 custom&#8208;made chalcogen&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described. Intersystem crossing rate constants were estimated by several independent methods and showed a dependency scaling as Z0.4 and &#950;0.2.







Abstract
Singlet dioxygen has been widely applied in different disciplines such as medicine (photodynamic therapy or blood sterilization), remediation (wastewater treatment) or industrial processes (fine chemicals synthesis). Particularly, it can be conveniently generated by energy transfer between a photosensitizer's triplet state and triplet dioxygen upon irradiation with visible light. Among the best photosensitizers, substituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines are prominent due to their excellent photophysical properties, which can be tuned by structural modifications, such as halogen&#8208; and chalcogen&#8208;atom substitution. These patterns allow for the enhancement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, commonly attributed to the heavy atom effect, which correlates with the atomic number (
) and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (
) of the introduced heteroatom. Herein, a fully systematic analysis of the effect exerted by chalcogen atoms on the photophysical characteristics (absorption and fluorescence properties, lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration), involving 30 custom&#8208;made &#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted chalcogen&#8208;bearing zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described and evaluated regarding the heavy atom effect. Besides, the intersystem crossing rate constants are estimated by several independent methods and a quantitative profile of the heavy atom is provided by using linear correlations between relative intersystem crossing rates and relative atomic numbers. Good linear trends for both intersystem crossing rates (S1&#8208;T1 and T1&#8208;S0) were obtained, with a dependency on the atomic number and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant scaling as 
 and 
, respectively The trend shows to be independent of the solvent and temperature.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships for Potential Inversion From Electron Acceptors Based on Thiophene&#8208;Fused Triptycene Quinones, 1,4&#8208;Diketones and Their Malononitrile Adducts</title>

         <dc:description>
The products of two isomeric thiophene/triptycene para&#8208;quinones with malononitrile provide insights into modulating potential inversion in 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane type electron&#8208;acceptors. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding influences both the product distribution of the reaction to make the quinones, and the NMR chemical shift of the bridgehead hydrogens involved.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of a series of 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane (TCAQ) inspired electron acceptors based on thiophene&#8208;fused quinone and triptycene motifs is presented. This has yielded insights into structure&#8208;property relationships for establishing and modulating simultaneous two&#8208;electron reduction processes in TCAQ analogues. These new compounds were synthesised using a Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation between triptycene and thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarbonyl chloride. Isomeric para&#8208;quinones featuring a [c]&#8208;fused thiophene on one side and a &#946;,&#946;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;fused triptycene on the other were isolated alongside a thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;diketone which bears two triptycene fragments. Knoevenagel condensation of these products with malononitrile produced a quinoidal bis(dicyanomethylene), an oxo&#8208;dicyanomethylene and an acyclic bis(dicyanomethylene). This series of new electron accepting molecules has been studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography and the implications of their 3D structures on NMR and UV/vis absorbance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results have been ascertained with conclusions underpinned by computational methods.

         <title>Phosphoramide&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Effective Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphoramide&#8208;based tri&#8208; and hexacarboxylic acids L1 and L2 have been used as ligands for metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Whereas Zn&#8722;L1 and Cu&#8722;L1, with pseudo&#8208;3D network structures with strong hydrogen bonds between 2D layers, show high thermal stability and porosity, Zn&#8722;L2, with a typical 3D network structure, exhibits high stability and excellent gas&#8208;adsorption properties for H2, CO2, and CH4 without open metal sites.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective and facile synthetic routes to organic ligands, along with porous materials that exhibit exceptional gas&#8208;storage properties, promise significant industrial applications. Here, a two&#8208;step synthesis of novel organophosphorus ligands without metal catalysts is reported. These ligands serve as versatile linkers for the construction of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating various metal ions, including zinc and copper. One of the zinc&#8208;based MOFs demonstrates remarkable gas&#8208;storage properties, with a hydrogen (H2) capacity exceeding 2.5&#8197;wt% at 77&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa as well as a carbon dioxide (CO2) capacity exceeding 20&#8197;wt% at 298&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa. Furthermore, this zinc&#8208;based MOF can be synthesized through a solvothermal process on the gram scale that yields high&#8208;quality single crystals.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy and 2D materials: a perfect combination. Since graphene's SERS effect observation, 2D layered materials have been developed as active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). This perspective highlights the key concepts behind SERS spectroscopy and provides new insights into a new research field that combines the design of SERS 2D substrates using Raman spectroscopy and imaging.







Abstract
The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a technique for detecting small amounts of (bio)chemical analytes has become increasingly popular in various fields. While gold and silver nanostructures have been extensively studied as SERS substrates, the availability of other types of substrates is currently expanding the applications of this spectroscopic method. Recently, researchers have begun exploring two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials (e.&#8201;g., graphene&#8208;like nanostructures) as substrates for SERS analysis. These materials offer unique optical properties, a well&#8208;defined structure, and the ability to modify their surface chemistry. As a contribution to advance this field, this concept article highlights the significance of understanding the chemical mechanism that underlies the experimental Raman spectra of chemisorbed molecules onto 2D materials&#8217; surfaces. Therefore, the article discusses recent advancements in fabricating substrates using 2D layered materials and the synergic effects of using their metallic composites for SERS applications. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on using Raman imaging in developing 2D materials as analytical platforms for Raman spectroscopy, an exciting emerging research area with significant potential.

         <title>The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear double duty? When coupled with heavy alkali counter&#8208;cations, depleted uranium (from nuclear fuel production) in the form of a uranyl triperoxide is a potent material for CO2 direct air capture (DAC). In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301687), M. Nyman and co&#8208;workers show how they isolated highly reactive Cs+ and Rb+ uranyl triperoxide materials and how the reactivity of the alkali uranyl triperoxide analogues increases with increasing alkali size, through polymerization in solution and through CO2 DAC in the solid state.

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation of Indoles Using 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Zero&#8208;Valent Magnesium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ancient Eastern legend of master swordsmiths Gan Jiang and Mo Ye recounts their creation of legendary blades through a harmonious blend of raw materials, skilled craftsmanship, and the application of intense physical energy. The depicted process mirrors this fusion of elements, as the mechanical energy applied to magnesium, akin to the smiths&#8242; hammer strikes, triggers a transformative catalytic reaction that yields chemically enriched 2&#8208;arylindoles. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Yu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304231).

         <title>A pH&#8208;Sensitive Double Chromophore Fluorescent Dye for Live&#8208;Tracking of Lipophagy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live monitoring the fate of lipid droplets (LD) within cells! To visualize and quantify lipophagy in an easily applicable, non&#8208;toxic and protein label&#8208;free approach by means of fluorescence microscopy, a unique dye called Lipo&#8208;Fluddy&#8208;1 was developed. This synthetic dye is characterized by a high lipophilicity and contains two chromophores, one of which only fluoresces at low pH. Its usefulness was demonstrated by the flow cytometry investigation of lipophagy in several cell lines.







Abstract
Lipid droplet (LD) degradation provides metabolic energy and important building blocks for various cellular processes. The two major LD degradation pathways include autophagy (lipophagy), which involves delivery of LDs to autolysosomes, and lipolysis, which is mediated by lipases. While abnormalities in LD degradation are associated with various pathological disorders, our understanding of lipophagy is still rudimentary. In this study, we describe the development of a lipophilic dye containing two fluorophores, one of which is pH&#8208;sensitive and the other pH&#8208;stable. We further demonstrate that this &#8220;Lipo&#8208;Fluddy&#8221; can be used to visualize and quantify lipophagy in living cells, in an easily applicable and protein label&#8208;free approach. After estimating the ability of compound candidates to penetrate LDs, we synthesized several BODIPY and (pH&#8208;switchable) rhodol dyes, whose fluorescence properties (incl. their photophysical compatibility) were analyzed. Of three Lipo&#8208;Fluddy dyes synthesized, one exhibited the desired properties and allowed observation of lipophagy by fluorescence microscopy. Also, this dye proved to be non&#8208;toxic and suitable for the examination of various cell lines. Moreover, a method was developed to quantify the lipophagy process using flow cytometry, which could be applied in the future in the identification of lipophagy&#8208;related genes or in the screening of potential drugs against lipophagy&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Ether Naphthotube Host&#8208;Guest Complexes and [2]Rotaxanes with Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ether naphthotube was able to complex strongly with organic dications in organic solution to give an association constant up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. Thermodynamically, the host&#8208;guest interactions are exclusively enthalpically driven and enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation phenomena have been observed. Besides, a linear free energy correlation was observed between binding strengths and the Hammett substituent constants. The host&#8208;guest system can be directly applied for the preparation of more complex interlocked molecules by simple stoppering.







Abstract
The interactions between ether naphthotube and a series of dication guests in organic solution were investigated. It was found that ether naphthotube formed stable host&#8208;guest complexes selectively with these guests in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio with association constants ranging from 102 to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1, which were confirmed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectra and ITC experiments.

     alt="Ether Naphthotube Host-Guest Complexes and [2]Rotaxanes with Dications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ether naphthotube was able to complex strongly with organic dications in organic solution to give an association constant up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thermodynamically, the host-guest interactions are exclusively enthalpically driven and enthalpy-entropy compensation phenomena have been observed. Besides, a linear free energy correlation was observed between binding strengths and the Hammett substituent constants. The host-guest system can be directly applied for the preparation of more complex interlocked molecules by simple stoppering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactions between ether naphthotube and a series of dication guests in organic solution were investigated. It was found that ether naphthotube formed stable host-guest complexes selectively with these guests in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio with association constants ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which were confirmed by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectra and ITC experiments. The host-guest interactions are driven by enthalpy change as the entropic factors are unfavorable. Positive correlations between &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; and &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; have been observed in the host-guest complexes. Furthermore, the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substitution of the guests can significantly affect the binding affinities through a combination of field/inductive and resonance effects by following a linear free energy relationship. Based on the host-guest complexes composed of ether naphthotube and organic cations, two interlocked [2]rotaxanes were prepared by cationization reaction and Huisgen cycloaddition between the cations and the stopper components. The ether naphthotube-based host-guest complexes are useful for creating sophisticated interlocked molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Intensity Circular Dichroism of Head&#8208;to&#8208;tail Regioregular Poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s in the Aggregated State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circular dichroism (CD) studies on poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s bearing a chiral side chain in the aggregated conditions were carried out. Little CD was observed in a solution form, while addition of a poor solvent into the polyphenylene solution induced aggregation and a strong CD was observed, accordingly. Applying the controlled degree of polymerization (DP) of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) in the use of bidentate diphosphine Chiraphos as a ligand for the nickel catalyst, the relationship of DP with CD strength was studied to reveal to show the highest CD at the DP = 84 (gabs = ca. 2 x 10&#8211;2). It was also found that the related aggregation was observed in good solvent 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane upon standing the solution at 4 &#176;C for 3&#8211;23 days to observe gabs = ca. 10&#8211;1. Studies on the substituent effect of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) suggested that CD behaviors were dependent on the type of non&#8208;chiral substituent on the aromatic ring as well as the side&#8208;chain chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Fatigue Resistance and Autonomous Switching of pH Responsive Hydrazones by Pulses of a Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemically triggered reversible switching of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones involves rotary motion&#8208;induced configurational changes, serving as a prototype for constructing an array of molecular machines. Typically, the configurational isomerization of such switches into two distinct forms (E/Z) occurs through the alteration of the pH the medium, achieved by successive additions of acid and base stimuli. However, this process results in intermittent operation due to the concomitant accumulation of salt after each cycle, limiting switching performance to only a few cycles (5&#8208;6). In this context, we introduce a novel strategy for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of hydrazones in acetonitrile using pulses of trichloroacetic acid as a chemical fuel. The use of this transient acid enabled reversible switching of hydrazones even after 50 cycles without causing significant fatigue. To test the broad viability of the fuel, a series of ortho/para&#8208;substituted hydrazones were synthesized and their switching performance was investigated. The analysis of kinetic data showed a strong dependency of switching operations including the lifetime of transient state, on the electronic properties of substituents. Finally, a distinct color change from yellow to orange due to reversible switching of the para&#8208;methoxy substituted hydrazone was employed for the creation of rewritable messages on commercially available paper.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials have received much attention for being potential candidates of smart materials. However, the occurrence of polymorphism&#8208;driven stimuli responses in crystalline materials remains interesting but rare. Herein, three polymorphs of an acylhydrazone derivative, N'&#8208;[(E)&#8208;(1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methylidene] pyridine &#8208;4&#8208;carbohydrazide (BFMP) were prepared. Form&#8208;1 undergoes a photomechanical response via E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z&#8594;E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form&#8208;1. The solid&#8208;melt&#8208;solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid&#8208;solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form&#8208;2 to form&#8208;3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form&#8208;2 and form&#8208;3 provides a structural basis for the grinding&#8208;induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acid chromic property. The combination of photochromism and acid chromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum Sulfide Nanoflowers as Electrodes for Efficient and Scalable Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) bridge the unique advantages of batteries and capacitors and are considered promising energy storage devices for hybrid vehicles and other electronic gadgets. Lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) have attained particular interest due to their higher energy and power density than traditional supercapacitor devices. The limited voltage window and the deterioration of anode materials upsurged the demand for efficient and stable electrode materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is a promising candidate for developing efficient and durable LICs due to its wide lithiation potential and unique layer structure, enhancing charge storage efficiency. Modifying the extrinsic features, such as the dimensions and shape at the nanoscale, serves as a potential path to overcome the sluggish kinetics observed in the LICs. Herein, the MoS2 nanoflowers have been synthesized through a hydrothermal route. The developed LIC exhibited a specific capacitance of 202.4 F g&#8209;1 at 0.25 A g&#8209;1 and capacitance retention of &gt; 90% over 5,000 cycles. Using an ether electrolyte improved the voltage window (2.0 V) and enhanced the stability performance. The ex&#8208;situ material characterization after the stability test reveals that the storage mechanism in MoS2&#8208;LICs is not diffusion&#8208;controlled. Instead, &#160;fast surface redox reactions, especially intercalation/deintercalation, are more prominent for charge storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;State Structure of a Long&#8208;Loop G&#8208;quadruplex Formed within Promoters of Plasmodium falciparum B var Genes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal loop of ten nucleotides. The G&#8208;quadruplex is formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2], named UpsB&#8208;Q&#8208;1. This sequence is found within promoters of the var genes of Plasmodium falciparum, which play a key role in malaria pathogenesis and evasion of the immune system. The [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed under physiologically relevant conditions exhibits a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding. Unique equilibrium of the two closely related 3D structures originates from a North&#8208;South repuckering of deoxyribose moiety of residue T27 in the lateral loop. Besides the 12 guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in loop regions are involved in interactions at both G&#8208;quartet&#8208;loop interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Equilibrium between Quinoid/Biradical Forms Enhancing Electrochemical Amphotericity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon dibenzo annulation on Thiele&#8217;s hydrocarbon (tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethane), the quinoid form and the biradical form adopt quite different geometries, and thus are no longer resonance structures. When these two forms can interconvert rapidly due to the small energy barrier (&#916;G&#8225;), the equilibrated mixture contains both forms in a ratio that is determined by the energy difference (&#916;Go) between the two forms. For a series of tetrakis[5&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl]&#8208;substituted derivatives, the more stable quinoid form and the metastable biradical form coexist in solution as an equilibrated mixture due to small &#916;G&#8225; (&lt; 15 kcal mol&#8211;1) and &#916;Go (1&#8208;4 kcal mol&#8211;1), in which the proportion of the two forms can be regulated by temperature. Since the biradical form can undergo easy two&#8208;electron (2e) oxidation to the corresponding dications as well as easy 2e reduction to the dianions, it exhibits very high electrochemical amphotericity. This character with a record&#8208;small span for not only the first oxidation and reduction potentials but also the second those, [E1sum &#8776; E2sum = E2ox &#8208; E2red = ca. 1.4 V], is attained through thermally enhanced conversion to the biradical form from the corresponding quinoid form, the latter of which is less amphoteric due to higher Eox and lower Ered values.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A terminal [NiII&#8208;OH] complex 1, supported by triflamide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligands, showed divergent reactivity for the reaction of sulfone with alcohol, contingent on base concentration, temperature, and time. Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols with sulfones was achieved using one equiv. of base, whereas lowering base loading to 0.5 equiv. afforded &#945;&#8208;alkylated sulfones. Besides excellent substrate scope and selectivity, biologically active stilbene derivatives DMU&#8208;212, pinosylvin, resveratrol, and piceatannol were synthesized in high yield under Julia&#8208;type olefination conditions. An extensive array of controlled experiments and DFT calculations provide valuable insight on the reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation, Characterization and Reactivity of a High&#8208;valent Mononuclear Cobalt(IV)&#8208;diazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent Fe(IV)=O intermediates of metalloenzymes have inspired numerous efforts to generate synthetic analogs to mimic and understand their substrate oxidation reactivities. However, high&#8208;valent M(IV) complexes of late transition metals are rare. We have recently reported a novel Co(IV)&#8208;dinitrate complex (1&#8208;NO3) that activates sp3&#160;C&#8208;H bonds up to 87 kcal/mol. In this work, we have shown that the nitrate ligands in&#160;1&#8208;NO3&#160;can be replaced by&#160;azide,&#160;a more basic coordinating base, resulting in the formation of a more potent Co(IV)&#8208;diazide species (1&#8208;N3) that reacts with substrates (hydrocarbons and phenols) at faster rate constants and activates stronger C&#8208;H bonds than the parent complex&#160;1&#8208;NO3. We have characterized&#160;1&#8208;N3&#160;employing a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches. Our results clearly show that the coordination of azide leads to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the higher basicity of azide, these thermodynamic parameters contribute to the higher driving forces of&#160;1&#8208;N3&#160;than&#160;1&#8208;NO3&#160;for C&#8208;H bond activation. Our discoveries are thus insightful for designing more reactive bio&#8208;inspired high&#8208;valent late transition metal complexes for activating inert aliphatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanosynthesis of Oligopeptides by Coupling Peptide Segments of Different Lengths &#8211; Elucidating the Role of Cesium Carbonate in Ball Mill Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an idea for the synthesis of oligopeptides using a solvent&#8208;free ball milling approach. Our concept is inspired by block play, in which it is possible to construct different objects using segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. We prove that by having a library of short peptides and employing the ball mill mechanosynthesis (BMMS) method, peptides can be easily coupled to form different oligopeptides with the desired functional and biological properties. Optimizing the BMMS process we found that the best yields we obtained when TBTU and cesium carbonate were used as reagents. The role of Cs2CO3 in the coupling mechanism was followed on each stage of synthesis by 1H, 13C and 133Cs NMR employing Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) techniques. It was found that cesium carbonate acts not only as a base but is also responsible for the activation of substrates and intermediates. The unique information about the BMMS mechanism is based on the analysis of 2D NMR data. The power of BMMS is proved by the example of different peptide combinations, 2+2, 3+2, 4+2, 5+2 and 4+4. The tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octapeptides obtained under this project were fully characterized by MS and NMR techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Porphyrin Cavitand Breathing&#8208;In to Constrict Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;porphyrin cages have long been exploited to bind fullerenes selectively for various applications. The major consideration for an effective binding here had been the cavity size. Herein, we structurally demonstrate that a bis&#8208;Ni&#8208;porphyrin cavitand having even a smaller cavity can host a larger fullerene by a breathing and ruffling mechanism. It has also been shown that both the electronic and steric influence at the meso&#8208; positions of the porphyrin in fact dictate the binding character. The smaller cavity of 2NiD exhibits preferential binding for C70 over C60; however, surprisingly, the larger cavities in 2HD and 2NiTD display stronger affinities for C60 over the larger fullerene. We show here that the structural elasticity infused both by the metalloporphyrins and the connecting bridges play a major role in directing the binding. These conclusions have adequately been supported by structural and spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, the suitability of one of the conjugates for photoinduced charge&#8208;separation has been investigated using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. 2NiD has a charge separation timescale of ~0.8 ps, while charge recombination occurs at a longer timescale of ~920 ps.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Reductive Recycling of Cathode Materials of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is inevitably accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries in a dialectical manner. Spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are harboring the characteristics of hazardous waste and high&#8208;value resources, so efficient recycling is of great significance. The cathode material is considered as an interesting target for repurposing. Despite some important reviews give commendable emphasis to recycling technologies, there is still a dearth of exploration of recycling mechanisms.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The prosperity of the lithium-ion battery market is inevitably accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries in a dialectical manner. Spent lithium-ion batteries are harboring the characteristics of hazardous waste and high-value resources, so efficient recycling is of great significance. The cathode material is considered as an interesting target for repurposing. Despite some important reviews give commendable emphasis to recycling technologies, there is still a dearth of exploration of recycling mechanisms. This deficiency of awareness highlights the need for further research and development in this area. This review aims to systematically review and thoroughly discuss the reduction reaction mechanism of each method regarding different cathode materials.

         <title>Classical versus Collective Interactions in Asymmetric Trigonal Bipyramidal Alkaline Metal&#8210;Boron Halide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collective interactions are a novel type of chemical bond formed between metals and electron&#8208;rich substituents around an electron&#8208;poor central atom. So far only a limited number of candidates for having collective interactions are reported. In this work, we extend the newly introduced concept of collective bonding to a series of neutral boron complexes with the general formula M2BX3 (M = Li, Na, and K; X = F, Cl, and Br). Our state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ab initio computations suggest that these complexes form trigonal bipyramidal structures with a D3h to C3v distortion along the C3 axis of symmetry. The BX3 unit in the complexes distorts from planar to pyramidal akin to a sp3 hybridized atom. Interestingly, the interaction of the metals with the pyramidal side of BX3, where the lone pair in a hypothetical [BX3]2&#8210; should be located, is weaker than the interactions of metals with the inverted side, i.e., the middle of three halogen atoms. The origin of this stronger interaction can be explained by the formation of collective interactions between metals and halogen atoms as we explored via energy decomposition within the context of the theory of interacting quantum atoms, IQA.</dc:description>

         <title>Alared: Solvatochromic and Fluorogenic Red Amino Acid for Ratiometric Live&#8208;cell Imaging of Bioactive Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To fill the need for environmentally sensitive fluorescent unnatural amino acids able to operate in the red region of the spectrum, we have designed and synthesized Alared, a red solvatochromic and fluorogenic amino acid derived from the Nile Red chromophore. The new unnatural amino acid can be easily integrated into bioactive peptides using classical solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The fluorescence quantum yield and the emission maximum of Alared&#8208;labeled peptides vary in a broad range depending on the peptide&#8217;s environment, making Alared a powerful reporter of biomolecular interactions. Due to its red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra, Alared&#8208;labeled peptides could be followed in living cells with minimal interference from cellular autofluorescence. Using ratiometric fluorescence microscopy, we were able to track the fate of the Alared&#8208;labeled peptide agonists of the apelin G protein&#8208;coupled receptor upon receptor activation and internalization. Due to its color&#8208;shifting environmentally sensitive emission, Alared allowed for distinguishing the fractions of peptides that are specifically bound to the receptor or unspecifically bound to different cellular membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Dearomatizing Cyclizations of 5&#8208;Arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Samarium Diiodide &#8211; A Computational Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations including all f&#8208;electrons of samarium allowed a detailed mechanistic analysis of the synthetically valuable reductive cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with samarium diiodide to bicyclic products. Details of the crucial electron&#8208;transfer processes, the diastereoselectivity, the regioselectivity and the influence of HMPA as ligand were correctly predicted.







Abstract
This study analyzes the samarium diiodide&#8208;promoted cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones to dearomatized bicyclic products utilizing density functional theory. The reaction involves a single electron transfer to the carbonyl group, which occurs synchronously with the rate determining cyclization event, and a second subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. These redox reactions are accurately computed employing small core pseudo potentials explicitly involving all f&#8208;electrons of samarium. Comparison of the energies of the possible final products rules out thermodynamic control of the observed regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Kinetic control via appropriate transition states is correctly predicted, but to obtain reasonable energy levels the influence of the co&#8208;solvent hexamethylphosphortriamide has to be estimated by using a correction term. The steric effect of the bulky samarium ligands is decisive for the observed stereoselectivity. Carbonyl groups in para&#8208;position of the aryl group change the regioselectivity of the cyclization and lead to spiro compounds. The computations suggest again kinetic control of this deviating outcome. However, the standard mechanism has to be modified and the involvement of a complex activated by two SmI2 moieties is proposed in which two electrons are transferred simultaneously to form the new C&#8722;C bond. Computation of model intermediates show the feasibility of this alternative+ mechanism.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Grown on the Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide to Realize High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Glucose Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve glucose detection, a series of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide, HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) are successfully synthesized. We explored the dosage and the synergistic effect of bimetals on the grown of nanomaterials as well as the electrochemical sensing performance. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.







Abstract
Glucose holds significant importance in disease diagnosis as well as beverage quality monitoring. The high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical sensor plays a crucial role in the electrochemical conversion technology. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are provided with high specific surface area and redox activity that are widely used in electrochemistry. Conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) perfectly combine the structural controllability of organic materials with the long&#8208;range ordering of inorganic materials that possess the characteristic of high electron mobility. Based on the above considerations, the combination of Ni(OH)2 and Ni&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) as an electrode modification material is designed to enhance electrochemical performance. In this work, to improve glucose detection, a sequence of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide) are successfully synthesised by doping metals into Ni&#8208;HHTP and Ni(OH)2, respectively. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.

         <title>In Situ Detection of Nucleic Acids in Extracellular Vesicles via Membrane Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept summarizes recent advancements in detecting extracellular vesicle (EV) nucleic acids via membrane fusion. These approaches mainly are classified into 1) universal and 2) targeted membrane fusion approaches, and their mechanisms, applications in biomedical diagnostics and the challenges and opportunities are discussed.







Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry diverse biomolecules (e.&#8201;g., nucleic acids, proteins) for intercellular communication, serving as important markers for diseases. Analyzing nucleic acids derived from EVs enables non&#8208;invasive disease diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Membrane fusion, a fundamental cellular process wherein two lipid membranes merge, facilitates cell communication and cargo transport. Building on this natural phenomenon, recent years have witnessed the emergence of membrane fusion&#8208;based strategies for the detection of nucleic acids within EVs. These strategies entail the encapsulation of detection probes within either artificial or natural vesicles, followed by the induction of membrane fusion with EVs to deliver probes. This innovative approach not only enables in&#8197;situ detection of nucleic acids within EVs but also ensures the maintenance of structural integrity of EVs, thus preventing nucleic acid degradation and minimizing the interference from free nucleic acids. This concept categorizes approaches into universal and targeted membrane fusion strategies, and discusses their application potential, and challenges and future prospects.

         <title>Stabilization of the Neutral [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) Radical by Hetero&#8208;Bimetal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hetero&#8208;bimetal coordination strategy was successfully applied to stabilize a ring&#8208;expanded porphyrin radical, [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0), i.&#8201;e., [25]Rosarin, in its neutral form by a mixed BF2/Rh(CO)2 coordination in the core.







Abstract
Stabilization of hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) (named &#8220;rosarin&#8221;) in its 25&#960; radical state is achieved using a hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination strategy. The antiaromatic BF2 complex B&#8208;1 was first synthesized, and then rhodium ion was inserted into B&#8208;1 to produce the BF2/Rh(CO)2 mixed complex Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 as a highly air&#8208;stable radical. The structures of B&#8208;1 and Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, and the antiaromatic or radical character was identified by various spectroscopy evidence and theoretical calculations. Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 exhibits excellent redox properties, enabling amphoteric aromatic&#8208;antiaromatic conversion to their 24/26&#960; states. Compared to the 24/26&#960; conjugation systems on the same skeleton, Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 has the narrowest electrochemical and optical band gaps, with the longest absorption band at 1010&#8197;nm. The ring&#8208;current analysis reveals intense paratropic currents for B&#8208;1 and co&#8208;existing diatropic&#8208;paratropic currents for Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1. This hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination system provides a novel platform for organic radical stabilization on porphyrinoids, showing the prospect of modulating ligand oxidation states through rational coordination design.

         <title>Facilitating Electron Transfer by Resizing Cyclocarbon Acceptor from C18 to C16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of low reorganization energy and high electron affinity makes the C16 cyclocarbon a better electron acceptor than the C18 molecule. In complexes with strong electron donors, photoinduced charge separation occurs within picoseconds.







Abstract
Recent advances in synthetic methods, combined with tip&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface chemistry, have enabled the formation of numerous cyclocarbon molecules. Here, we investigate computationally the experimentally studied C16 and C18 molecules as well as their van der Waals (vdW) complexes with several typical donor and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate a remarkable electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of cyclocarbon molecules. The vdW complexes of C16 and C18 exhibit a thermodynamically favorable photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor partner to the cyclocarbons that occurs on a picosecond time scale. The lower reorganization energy of C16 compared to C18 leads to a significant acceleration of the ET reactions.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of PdCuAg and CeO2 Nanowires Hybrid with Abundant Heterojunction Interface for Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid of PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires with structural (abundant heterojunction/interfaces and ultrathin nanowire structure) and compositional advantages were facile prepared by one&#8208;pot method, thus embracing enhanced electrocatalytic performance for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Introducing CeO2 into Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via a one&#8208;pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.

         <title>Functional Plasticity of a Viral Terpene Synthase, OILTS, that Shows Non&#8211;Specific Metal Cofactor Binding and Metal&#8211;dependent Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OILTS, a terpene synthase found from a giant virus, exhibits high plasticity to metal cofactors. It can use even Zn2+ known to severely decrease the activities of many terpene synthases. In addition, when Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ were used as the cofactors, the profile of enzyme product was changed. The functional plasticity may benefit the virus in adapting to diverse environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.







Abstract
OILTS is a viral class I terpene synthase found from the giant virus Orpheovirus IHUMI&#8211;LCC2. It exhibits a unique structure and demonstrates high plasticity to metal cofactors, allowing it to biosynthesize different cyclic terpene frameworks. Notably, while OILTS produces only (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8211;4&#8211;ol with the most common cofactor, Mg2+, it also biosynthesizes a different cyclic terpene, (+)&#8208;cubebol, with Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+, presenting a rare instance of cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme catalysis. This is the first report of (+)&#8208;cubebol biosynthesis, to our knowledge. In addition, OILTS can uptake Zn2+ as a cofactor, which is uncommon among ordinary terpene synthases. These findings suggest that OILTS&#8242;s functional plasticity may benefit the virus in diverse host environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene based Cu(I) metallocycle constituting the prototype for reversibly photoswitchable (3d&lt;M&#8208;)metallocycles (i.&#8201;e. without disassembly) is presented. Its ultrafast dynamics and the yield of the respective photostationary state reveal strong similarities with archetypical azobenzene. The unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD elucidates the interplay of dynamics and solvation. Coupled with quantum chemical calculations, this interdisciplinary approach reveals a non&#8208;cooperative photoisomerization.







Abstract
The novel photoswitchable ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Azobenz(metPA)2 (1) is used to prepare a [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 metallocycle (2), whose photoisomerization was characterized using static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. Optical studies demonstrate the highly quantitative and reproducible photoinduced cyclic E/Z switching without decay of the complex. Accordingly and best to our knowledge, [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 constitutes the first reversibly photoswitchable (3d)&#8208;metallocycle based on azobenzene. The photoinduced multiexponential dynamics in the sub&#8208;picosecond to few picosecond time domain of 1 and 2 have been assessed. These ultrafast dynamics as well as the yield of the respective photostationary state (PSSZ = 65&#8201;%) resemble the behavior of archetypical azobenzene. Also, the innovative pump&#8208;probe laser technique of gas phase transient photodissociation (&#964;&#8208;PD) in a mass spectrometric ion trap was used to determine the intrinsic relaxation dynamics for the isolated complex. These results are consistent with the results from femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) in solution, emphasizing the azobenzene&#8208;like dynamics of 2. This unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD enables valuable insights into the prevailing interplay of dynamics and solvation. Both analyses (in solution and gas phase) and quantum chemical calculations reveal a negligible effect of the metal coordination on the switching mechanism and electronic pathway, which suggests a non&#8208;cooperative isomerization process.

&lt;p&gt;An azobenzene based Cu(I) metallocycle constituting the prototype for reversibly photoswitchable (3d&amp;lt;M-)metallocycles (i.&#8201;e. without disassembly) is presented. Its ultrafast dynamics and the yield of the respective photostationary state reveal strong similarities with archetypical azobenzene.

         <title>Structural Chemistry of Titanium (IV) Oxo Clusters, Part 2: Clusters Without Carboxylate or Phosphonate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review completes a series of three articles which provide a comprehensive coverage of the structural chemistry of polynuclear titanium oxo compounds. The interplay of structure&#8208;influencing coordination characteristics of the ligands and preferred arrangement of the Ti/O polyhedra in the cluster cores is worked out.







Abstract
Homometallic titanium oxo clusters (TOC) are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters. In a previous article, TOC structures with carboxylato and phosphonato ligands were reviewed and categorized. This work is now extended to clusters with other ligands. Comparison of the different cluster types shows how the interplay between condensation of the titanium polyhedra by means of bridging oxygen atoms and the coordination characteristics of the ligands influences the cluster structures and allows working out basic construction principles of the cluster core.
