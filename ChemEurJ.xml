         <title>Tuning the Size and Geometry of Heteroleptic Coordination Cages by Varying the Ligand Bent Angle</title>

Angling for the right result: Heteroleptic Pd cages containing two types of dipyridyl ligands are described. The common feature of these complexes is the presence of two 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligands (depicted in gray). By varying the ligand bent angle, &#945;, of the second ligand, we were able to able to increase the nuclearity of the assembly from 4 to 8.







Abstract
Spherical assemblies of the type [PdnL2n]2n+ can be obtained from PdII salts and curved N&#8208;donor ligands, L. It is well established that the bent angle, &#945;, of the ligand is a decisive factor in the self&#8208;assembly process, with larger angles leading to complexes with a higher nuclearity, n. Herein, we report heteroleptic coordination cages of the type [PdnLnL&#8242;n]2n+, for which a similar correlation between the ligand bent angle and the nuclearity is observed. Tetranuclear cages were obtained by combining [Pd(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 with 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and ligands featuring a bent angle of &#945;=120&#176;. The use of a dipyridyl ligand with &#945;=149&#176; led to the formation of a hexanuclear complex with a trigonal prismatic geometry; for linear ligands, octanuclear assemblies of the type [Pd8L8L&#8242;8]16+ were obtained. The predictable formation of heteroleptic PdII cages from 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and different dipyridyl ligands is evidence that there are entire classes of heteroleptic cage structures that are privileged from a thermodynamic point of view.

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Responsive Pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;Functionalized NHC Ligand on Ir Complex for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Cp*Ir(III) complex (  1  ) of a newly designed ligand L  1  featuring a proton&#8208;responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N  &#8208;  heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of  1  reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of  1  with HBF  4  in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L  1  H)Cl]BF  4  (  2  ). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protonation of  1  with acid is examined by  1  H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. The proton&#8208;responsive character of  1  is exploited for catalyzing  &#945;  &#8208;alkylation of ketones and  &#946;  &#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen&#8208;borrowing methodology. Compound  1  is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L  2  )Cl]PF  6  (  3  ) lacking a proton&#8208;responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of  1  is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone. Detailed mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations substantiates the role of the proton&#8208;responsive ligand in the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;induced N&#8211;H Bond Splitting of Ammonia and Primary Amine of CuI&#8211;MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  , which is capable of cleaving N&#8211;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as O&#8211;H bond of H  2  O along with the spontaneous H  2  evolution. In the gas&#8208;solid phase reaction of  1  with ammonia and water vapour, Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  was gradually oxidized to NH  2  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF and OH&#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF, respectively, through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations, which was confirmed by XPS, PXRD and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that Cu  I  &#8211;MOF could lower N&#8208;H bond dissociation free energy of ammonia through coordination&#8208;induced bond weakening and promote H  2  evolution by the reduction potential of  1  . To our knowledge, this is the first example of MOFs which activated ammonia and amine in gas&#8208;solid manner.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reduction of Ketosteroids to Hydroxysteroids over Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 is a very promising heterogeneous catalyst for the selective reduction of ketosteroids to the corresponding hydroxysteroids through a Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reaction. Interestingly, the process leads to the diasteroselective synthesis of elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxy derivatives in one step, while most chemical and biological transformations produce the 17&#946;&#8208;OH compounds, or they require several additional steps to convert 17&#946;&#8208;OH into 17&#945;&#8208;OH by inverting the configuration of the 17 center. Moreover, MOF&#8208;808 is found to be stable and reusable, and it is also chemoselective (only keto groups are reduced, even in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C bonds) and regioselective (in 3,17&#8208;diketosteroids only the keto group in position 17 is reduced, while the 3&#8208;keto group remains almost intact). Kinetic rate constant and thermodynamic parameters of estrone reduction to estradiol have been obtained by a detailed temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis. The results evidence a major contribution of the entropic term, thus suggesting that the diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities, where the Zr  4+  active sites are located.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H  2  or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H  2  or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior.

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin and High&#8208;Spin Perferryl Intermediates in Non&#8208;Heme Iron Catalyzed Oxidations of Aliphatic C&#8722;H Groups</title>

Direct C&#8722;H activation: Investigation of the oxidation of aliphatic C&#8722;H groups in the presence of nonheme iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family exhibits no uniform correlation between the spin state and reactivity of the oxoiron(V) intermediates and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems, thus witnessing apparent violation of the common &#8220;reactivity&#8208;selectivity&#8221; principle for this reaction.







Abstract
The selectivity patterns of iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family in aliphatic C&#8722;H oxidation with H2O2 have been studied (PDP=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrolidine). Cyclohexane, adamantane, 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyloctane, 3,7&#8208;dimethyloctyl acetate, (&#8722;)&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;p&#8208;menthane, and cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane were used as substrates. The studied catalyst systems generate low&#8208;spin (S=1/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates or high&#8208;spin (S=3/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates, depending on the electron&#8208;donating ability of remote substituents at the pyridine rings. The low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates demonstrate lower stability and higher reactivity toward aliphatic C&#8722;H groups of cyclohexane than their high&#8208;spin congeners, according to the measured self&#8208;decay and second&#8208;order rate constants k1 and k2. Unexpectedly, there appears to be no uniform correlation between the spin state of the oxoiron(V) intermediates, and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems in the oxidation of the considered substrates. This contrasts with the asymmetric epoxidations by the same catalyst systems, in which case the epoxidation enantioselectivity increases when passing from the systems featuring the more reactive low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates to those with their less reactive high&#8208;spin congeners.

Semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an UV&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ETPTA), linear polymer chains (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and lithium salt solution are designed to satisfy the demands of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability. LiFePO4/Li battery based on the SNP electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycling stability at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has a pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.

         <title>Imide Condensation as a Strategy for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Diversified G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands with Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activity**

The rigid rules of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization: A library of amphiphiles has been synthesized in one step, using a simple imide condensation reaction. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization, anti&#8208;cancer and anti&#8208;parasitic activity of the library has been investigated, uncovering the important factors that govern G&#8208;quadruplex binding and selectivity, yielding a promising new core&#8208;motif and a compound with potent trypanosomacidal activity.







Abstract
A facile imide coupling strategy for the one&#8208;step preparation of G&#8208;quadruplex ligands with varied core chemistries is described. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization of a library of nine compounds was examined using FRET melting experiments, and CD, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and NMR titrations, identifying several compounds that were capable of stabilizing G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with interesting selectivity profiles. The best G4 ligand was identified as compound 3, which was based on a perylene scaffold and exhibited 40&#8208;fold selectivity for a telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex over duplex DNA. Surprisingly, a tetra&#8208;substituted flexible core, compound 11, also exhibited selective stabilization of G4 DNA over duplex DNA. The anticancer and antiparasitic activity of the library was also examined, with the lead compound 3 exhibiting nanomolar inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei with 78&#8208;fold selectivity over MRC5 cells. The cellular localization of this compound was also studied via fluorescence microscopy. We found that uptake was time dependant, with localization outside the nucleus and kinetoplast that could be due to strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of small amounts of DNA.

         <title>Rational Construction of a N, F Co&#8208;doped Mesoporous Cobalt Phosphate with Rich&#8208;Oxygen Vacancies for Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 28, Page 7731-7737, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced performance: A N, F co&#8208;doped mesoporous cobalt&#8208;based phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies was obtained by a facile in&#8208;situ pyrolysis. It exhibited highly efficient performance for OER and supercapacitors, which should be attributed to the introduction of N and F allowing regulation of its electronic structure and increasing its electroactive sites.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphates have been widely applied as promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this study, we report a simple method to prepare a N, F co&#8208;doped mesoporous cobalt phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies by in&#8208;situ pyrolysis of a Co&#8208;phosphate precursor with NH4+ cations and F&#8722; anions. Due to this heteroatom doping, it could achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 at lower overpotential of 276&#8197;mV and smaller Tafel slope of 57.11&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 on glassy carbon. Moreover, it could keep 92&#8201;% of initial current density for 35&#8197;h, indicating it has an excellent stability and durability. Furthermore, the optimal material applied in supercapacitor displays specific capacitance of 206.3&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains cycling stability with 80&#8201;% after 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties should be attributed to N, F co&#8208;doping into this Co&#8208;based phosphate, which effectively modulates its electronic structure. In addition, its amorphous structure provides more active sites; moreover, its mesoporous structure should be beneficial to mass transfer and electrolyte diffusion.

&lt;p&gt;Transition&#8208;metal phosphates have been widely applied as promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this study, we report a simple method to prepare a N, F co&#8208;doped mesoporous cobalt phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies by in&#8208;situ pyrolysis of a Co&#8208;phosphate precursor with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Due to this heteroatom doping, it could achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at lower overpotential of 276&#8197;mV and smaller Tafel slope of 57.11&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; on glassy carbon. Moreover, it could keep 92&#8201;% of initial current density for 35&#8197;h, indicating it has an excellent stability and durability.

         <title>Paramagnetic Solid&#8208;State NMR to Localize the Metal&#8208;Ion Cofactor in an Oligomeric DnaB Helicase</title>

Paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR enables the positioning of the metal&#8208;ion co&#8208;factor in the ATP&#8208;fueled bacterial helicase DnaB from Helicobacter pylori. Diamagnetic Mg2+ is exchanged by paramagnetic Mn2+ and Co2+ leading to paramagnetic relaxation enhancements and pseudo&#8208;contact shifts in the NMR spectra. The Co2+ pseudo&#8208;contact shift surface reveals insights into DNA binding.







Abstract
Paramagnetic metal ions can be inserted into ATP&#8208;fueled motor proteins by exchanging the diamagnetic Mg2+ cofactor with Mn2+ or Co2+. Then, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) or pseudo&#8208;contact shifts (PCSs) can be measured to report on the localization of the metal ion within the protein. We determine the metal position in the oligomeric bacterial DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori complexed with the transition&#8208;state ATP&#8208;analogue ADP:AlF4&#8722; and single&#8208;stranded DNA using solid&#8208;state NMR and a structure&#8208;calculation protocol employing CYANA. We discuss and compare the use of Mn2+ and Co2+ in localizing the ATP cofactor in large oligomeric protein assemblies. 31P PCSs induced in the Co2+&#8208;containing sample are then used to localize the DNA phosphate groups on the Co2+ PCS tensor surface enabling structural insights into DNA binding to the DnaB helicase.

         <title>Cationic Aluminium Complexes as Catalysts for Imine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 28, Page 7756-7763, May 17, 2021. </description>

A series of strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#8722; salts. Their catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation depends strongly on the substituents in the BDI ligand. DFT calculations on the mechanism reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles. Hydrogen is activated either by Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine or Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pairs.







Abstract
Strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#8722; salts and were investigated for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. The backbone (R1) and N (R2) substituents on the R1,R2BDI ligand (R1,R2BDI=HC[C(R1)N(R2)]2) influence sterics and Lewis acidity. Ligand bulk increases along the row Me,DIPPBDI&lt;Me,DIPePBDI&#8776;tBu,DIPPBDI&lt;tBu,DIPePBDI; DIPP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Me2&#8208;phenyl, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Et2&#8208;phenyl. The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test showed acceptor numbers of: (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 85.6, (tBu,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 85.9, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 89.7, (Me,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 90.8, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlH+ 95.3. Steric and electronic factors need to be balanced for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. Open, highly Lewis acidic, cations strongly coordinate imine rendering it inactive as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP). The bulkiest cations do not coordinate imine but its combination is also not an active catalyst. The cation (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ shows the best catalytic activity for various imines and is also an active catalyst for the Tishchenko reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylbenzoate. DFT calculations on the mechanism of imine hydrogenation catalysed by cationic Al complexes reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles operating in concert. Hydrogen is activated either by FLP reactivity of an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine couple or, after formation of significant quantities of amine, by reaction with an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine couple. The latter autocatalytic Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine cycle is energetically favoured.

Polymer&#8208;decorated precursor particles: Silica particles functionalized with polythiolactone polymer brushes are precursor particles for molecular surface functionalization, nanoparticle assemblies for catalysis, and polymer capsules for payload delivery applications.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of colloidal silica has tremendous effects on its properties and applications. Commonly the design of silica particles is based on their de novo synthesis followed by surface functionalization leading to tailormade properties for a specific purpose. Here, the design of robust &#8220;precursor&#8221; polymer&#8208;decorated silica nano&#8208; and microparticles is demonstrated, which allows for easy post&#8208;modification by polymer embedded thiolactone chemistry. To obtain this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material, silica particles (SiO2P) were functionalized via surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA)&#8208;poly(thiolactone acrylamide (PThlAm) co&#8208;polymer brushes. Exploiting the versatility of thiolactone post&#8208;modification, a system was developed that could be used in three exemplary applications: 1) the straightforward molecular post&#8208;functionalization to tune the surface polarity, and therefore the dispersibility in various solvents; 2) the immobilization of metal nanoparticles into the polymer brushes via the in&#8197;situ formation of free thiols that preserved catalytic activity in a model reaction; 3) the formation of redox&#8208;responsive, permeable polymer capsules by crosslinking the thiolactone moieties with cystamine dihydrochloride (CDH) followed by dissolution of the silica core.

         <title>Programmed Multiple C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization of the Privileged 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline Template</title>

The introduction of substituents on a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline was selectively achieved by directed multiple C&#8722;H functionalizations. It could be decorated on four positions, successively at C&#8208;8, C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;5, three of which by using transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.







Abstract
The introduction of substituents on bare heterocyclic scaffolds can selectively be achieved by directed C&#8722;H functionalization. However, such methods have only occasionally been used, in an iterative manner, to decorate various positions of a medicinal scaffold to build chemical libraries. We herein report the multiple, site selective, metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. This medicinally privileged template indeed possesses multiple reactive sites for diversity&#8208;oriented functionalization, of which four were targeted. The C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;8 decorations were directed by an N&#8208;oxide, before taking benefit of an O&#8208;carbamoyl protection at C&#8208;4 to perform a Fries rearrangement and install a carboxamide at C&#8208;3. This also released the carbonyl group of 4&#8208;quinolones, the ultimate directing group to functionalize position 5. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.

The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density as well as the corresponding electronic inner&#8208;crystal forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provide the detailed examination of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A detailed analysis of a complete set of the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density is carried out for noncovalent interactions in the crystal of a uracil derivative using experimental X&#8208;ray charge density. The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.&#8201;g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Partially Saturated Fluorenyl&#8208;Derived [n]Helicenes Featuring an Overcrowded Alkene</title>

Blocking a molecular motor: The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (see figure), cyclic analogs of the well&#8208;known Feringa's molecular motors, are produced via a similar McMurry cyclization approach. While being composed of three diastereoisomers, they serve as valuable intermediates for the efficient, multi&#8208;gram scale access to the aromatic fluoreno[n]helicenes.







Abstract
The straightforward, multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (n=5 or 7) featuring a central, overcrowded alkene is described. The key cyclization step was based on an intramolecular McMurry reaction from the corresponding 1,5&#8208;diketones. Chiral stationary phase HPLC analysis and isomer separation indicate that each helicenic compound is constituted of three diastereoisomers at room temperature, i.&#8201;e. the configurationally stable (R,R,P)/(S,S,M) pair of enantiomers and an apparently achiral compound resulting from the rapid interconversion between the (R,S,P) and (S,R,M) enantiomers. The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes are oxidatively aromatized to give an efficient access to the corresponding fluoreno[n]helicenes. The chiroptical properties (vibrational and electronic circular dichroism) of the chiral, enantiopure compounds have been measured and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, confirming their helicoidal nature.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 28, Page 7696-7703, May 17, 2021. </description>

In the frame: The nitration of the V&#8208;shaped linker 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid by Al(NO3)3 and Ga(NO3)3 prior to crystallization of the MOF leads selectively to Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 and Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 type compounds. In situ IR spectroscopy and light scattering experiments in combination with 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy were used to study the product formation. DFT and GCMC calculations were employed to understand the differences in framework formation and water adsorption properties.







Abstract
The reaction of the V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with CAU&#8208;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type structure of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,&#8201;2,&#8201;4,&#8201;6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), whereas the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8201;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization, as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of the V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with CAU&#8208;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type structure of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L&lt;sup&gt;0,&#8201;2,&#8201;4,&#8201;6&lt;/sup&gt; or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as well as three different nitration products (L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, L&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and L&lt;sup&gt;4/6&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The compositions were deduced by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8201;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization, as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC&#8208;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

COFs in photocatalytic oxidation of organics: Hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 offers a fascinating alternative photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of valuable small organics such as amines, ethers, thioethers and pyridinium salts. By means of its superior photocatalytic ability in molecular oxygen activation and inherent heterogenous nature, the present protocol exhibits impressive efficiency, selectivity and sustainability.







Abstract
Photoactive two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have become promising heterogenous photocatalysts in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformations. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of various small organic molecules by using 2D&#8208;COFs as the photocatalyst was developed. In this protocol, due to the remarkable photocatalytic capability of hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 on molecular oxygen activation, a wide range of amides, quinolones, heterocyclic compounds, and sulfoxides were obtained with high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance under very mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, benefiting from the inherent advantage of heterogenous photocatalysis, prominent sustainability and easy photocatalyst recyclability, a drug molecule (modafinil) and an oxidized mustard gas simulant (2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide) were selectively and easily obtained in scale&#8208;up reactions. Mechanistic investigations were conducted using radical quenching experiments and in&#8197;situ ESR spectroscopy, all corroborating the proposed role of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 in photocatalytic cycle.

         <title>Click and Release Chemistry for Activity&#8208;Based Purification of &#946;&#8208;Lactam Targets</title>

In this study, we functionalized carbapenem &#946;&#8208;lactams for the development of an original activity&#8208;based purification method of the complex targets of these drugs. The alkyne drug covalently bound to the target specifically reacted with an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and an iminosydnone for single&#8208;step elution and fluorescent labeling of the targets.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams, the cornerstone of antibiotherapy, inhibit multiple and partially redundant targets referred to as transpeptidases or penicillin&#8208;binding proteins. These enzymes catalyze the essential cross&#8208;linking step of the polymerization of cell wall peptidoglycan. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of &#946;&#8208;lactams and of resistance to these drugs requires the development of reliable methods to characterize their targets. Here, we describe an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. We synthesized alkyne&#8208;carbapenems with suitable properties with respect to the kinetics of acylation of a model target, the Ldtfm L,D&#8208;transpeptidase, the stability of the resulting acylenzyme, and the reactivity of the alkyne for the cycloaddition of an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and a bioorthogonal cleavable linker. The probe provided access to the fluorescent target in a single click and release step.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Induced Growth of Coordination Polymer Derived&#8208;Straight Carbon Nanotubes on Carbon Nanofiber Network for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The scheme illustrates the sulfur&#8208;induced synthesis of a Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers network with abundant straight carbon nanotubes from a type of Co&#8208;based coordination polymer, which are encapsulated with Co9S8 nanoparticles. Combined with the effective catalytic sites of the Co, N, and S doped carbon nanofibers/carbon nanotubes and the unique structure of 3&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;connected carbon nanofiber network, CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;T shows excellent ORR catalytic activity.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon nanomaterials have been widely studied for efficient oxygen reduction reaction and energy storage and conversion in metal&#8208;air batteries. A Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional network construction of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with abundant straight long Co, N, and S&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed by thermal treatment of Co&#8208;based polymer coated onto polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network together with thiourea at 900&#8201;&#176;C, denoted as CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900. It is interesting to note that the introduction of a high concentration of sulfur does not lead to the complete toxicity of catalysts, but promotes the axial growth to selectively form straight CNTs instead of curly bamboo&#8208;like CNTs. The highly graphitized in&#8208;situ grown Co, N, S&#8208;doped CNTs and the 3&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped CNF network provide both active catalytic sites and highly conductive paths, which are beneficial for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, the optimal CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 performs the excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.84&#8197;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density of 5.49&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air devices also possess a high power density of 136.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 better than commercial Pt/C.

A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 is presented. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized and isolated. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as universal building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.







Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 was developed. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized via stepwise cyclopropanation of C60 with suitable macrocyclic tri&#8208; and bifunctional cyclomalonate tethers. The four resulting stereoisomers were isolated using chiral HPLC. The corresponding pairs of enantiomers show mirror image behavior in their CD&#8208;spectra. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as suitable building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of mixed hexakis&#8208;adducts. Implementation of functional group&#8208;bearing monomalonates afforded octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.

The regioselective synthesis of hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 with more than two different types of addends is still a challenging task in fullerene chemistry. Following a sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalization strategy, chiral [3:2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized and isolated. The isomerically pure pentakis&#8208;adducts served as universal building blocks for the synthesis of a series of octahedral [3:2:1] hexakis&#8208;adducts with outstanding regioselectivity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Hirsch et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100319).

The problem of antibiotic resistance requires innovative strategies for the identification of drug targets and the characterization of the emerging mechanisms of resistance. This is the case for the highly diverse and complex targets of &#946;&#8208;lactams that include essential biosynthetic enzymes, the transpeptidases, unessential hydrolases involved in peptidoglycan metabolism, and unknown enzymes. The findings reported here should have important implications in this context, as they propose an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Arthur, M. Fonvielle, M. Etheve&#8208;Quelquejeu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100653).

Starting from 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (not shown), in situ nitration leads to different nitrated linker molecules that selectively react with Ga3+ or Al3+ ions to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 and Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 type frameworks, respectively. The pale blue and orange light path represents the crystallization of the respective MOF. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Stock et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100373).

Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven gem Hydrogenation: An Orthogonal Entry into &#8220;Second&#8208;Generation&#8221; Ruthenium Carbene Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis</title>

On the spot: Light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation elicits the inherent vic&#8208;dicarbene character of a triple bond. This unusual reactivity mode can be harnessed in the form of a novel, safe, convenient and efficient approach to second&#8208;generation &#8220;Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8221;&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes for olefin metathesis that relies on the use of alkynes rather than diazoalkanes as the ultimate carbene sources.







Abstract
The newly discovered light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation of alkynes opens an unconventional yet efficient entry into five&#8208;coordinate Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes with cis&#8208;disposed chloride ligands. Representatives of this class featuring a chelate substructure formed by an iodo&#8208;substituted benzylidene unit react with (substituted) 2&#8208;isopropoxystyrene to give prototypical &#8220;second&#8208;generation&#8221; Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda complexes for olefin metathesis. The new approach to this venerable catalyst family is safe and versatile as it uses a triple bond rather than phenyldiazomethane as the ultimate carbene source and does not require any sacrificial phosphines.

A series of self&#8208;assembled multivalent Ag&#8208;SR coordination polymers with high phosphatase&#8208;like activity have been developed. This work represents a new alternative for the future rational design of highly efficient catalysts for hydrolysis of phosphates and carboxylates.







Abstract
We show herein the phosphatase&#8208;like catalytic activity of coordination polymers obtained after adding Ag+&#8208;ions to thiols bearing hydrophobic alkyl chains terminated with a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) group. The subsequent addition of Zn2+ &#8208;ions to the self&#8208;assembled polymers resulted in the formation of multivalent metal coordination polymers capable of catalysing the transphosphorylation of an RNA&#8208;model compound (2&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate, HPNPP) with high reactivity. Analysis of a series of metal ions showed that the highest catalytic activity was obtained when Ag+&#8208;ions were used as the first metal ions to construct the backbone of the coordination polymer through interaction with the &#8208;SH group followed by Zn2+&#8208;ions as the second metal ions complexed by the TACN&#8208;macrocycle. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the catalytic activity could be modulated by changing the length of the hydrophobic alkyl chain.

         <title>Enantioselective CO2 Fixation Via a Heck&#8208;Coupling/Carboxylation Cascade Catalyzed by Nickel</title>

COTWO task. An enantioselective nickel catalyzed tandem Heck coupling/carboxylation synthetic sequence with CO2 is reported that provides ready access to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids and analogous compounds (ee up to 99&#8201;%). Labelling experiments, DFT analysis and X&#8208;ray characterizations enabled both mechanistic steps and stereodiscriminating transition states to be fully elucidated.







Abstract
A novel asymmetric nickel&#8208;based procedure has been developed in which CO2 fixation is achieved as a second step of a truncated Heck coupling. For this, a new chiral ligand has been prepared and shown to achieve enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The overall process efficiently furnishes chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids, an important class of bioactive products, from easy to prepare starting materials. A combined experimental and computational effort revealed the key steps of the catalytic cycle and suggested the unexpected participation of Ni(I) species in the coupling event.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocycles via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Coupling of Thioesters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 28, Page 7651-7656, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins is reported, which provides unique and atom&#8208;economic access to spirocyclic scaffolds. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins has been developed for the efficient synthesis of spirocycles, a privileged scaffold commonly found in natural products. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. Initial mechanistic investigations are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism. The incorporated methylene sulfide substituent can undergo a variety of further reactions to increase molecular diversity and complexity. These results demonstrate that thioester derivatives can be used as powerful building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds.

&#8220;The key innovation of the paper is that we use a modular approach to functionalize colloidal silica. Rather than optimizing a different protocol for each application, we used versatile precursor particles coated with a reactive polythiolactone polymer shell that can be used for tailor&#8208;made functionalization for a broad range of applications, such as catalysis and controlled release.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;7668&#8197;ff.

         <title>Solvato Modulation of the Magnetic Memory in Isotopically Enriched Erbium Polyoxometallate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is molecular by essence while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid state properties. Solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometallate(POM)&#8211;based Na  9  [Er(W  5  O  18  )  2  ]&#183;35H  2  O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and temperature dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses. Isotopic enrichment with nuclear spin free (  166  Er, I=0) Er  III  ions shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.</dc:description>

         <title>Tune the Fluorescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by Controlling the Defect States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of graphite phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) are systematically investigated for the first time. The g&#8208;CN nanosheets (CNNSs) obtained at different condensation temperatures are used as the study models. It can be found that all the CNNSs have two kinds of defect states, one is originated from the edge of CNNSs (labeled as CN&#8208;defect) and the other is attributed to the partially carbonization regions (labeled as C&#8208;defect). Both the two kinds of defect states affect substantially the luminescent properties of CNNSs. Both the FL and ECL signals of CNNSs contain a band gap emission and two defect emissions. For the FL of CNNSs, decreasing the density of defect states can increase efficiently the FL quantum yield, while increasing the density of defect states can make the FL spectra red&#8208;shift. For the ECL of CNNSs, increasing the density of CN&#8208;defect states and decreasing the density of C&#8208;defect states are greatly important to improve the ECL activity. This work provides a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and is of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN. Also, it will greatly promote the applications of CNNSs based on the FL and ECL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Round DNA Aptamer Selection by Combined Use of Capillary Electrophoresis and Next Generation Sequencing: An Aptaomics Approach for Identifying Unique Functional Protein&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In DNA aptamer selection, existing methods do not discriminate aptamer sequences based on their binding affinity and function and the reproducibility of the selection is often poor, even for the selection of well&#8208;known aptamers like those that bind the commonly used model protein thrombin. In the present study, a novel single&#8208;round selection method (SR&#8208;CE selection) was developed by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE) with next generation sequencing. Using SR&#8208;CE selection, a successful semi&#8208;quantitative and semi&#8208;comprehensive aptamer selection for thrombin was demonstrated with high reproducibility for the first time. Selection rules based on dissociation equilibria and kinetics were devised to obtain families of analogous sequences. Selected sequences of the same family were shown to bind thrombin with high affinity. Furthermore, data acquired from SR&#8208;CE selection was mined by creating sub&#8208;libraries that were categorized by the functionality of the aptamers (e.g., pre&#8208;organized aptamers vs. structure&#8208;induced aptamers). Using this approach, a novel fluorescent molecular recognition sensor for thrombin with nanomolar detection limits was discovered. Thus, in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept report, we have demonstrated the potential of a &#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; approach to systematically design functional aptamers as well as to obtain high affinity aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>(Automated) Synthesis of Well&#8208;defined&#160;Staphylococcus Aureus&#160;Wall Teichoic Acid Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important components of the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram&#8208;positive bacterium&#160;  Staphylococcus aureus  . WTAs are composed of repeating ribitol phosphate (RboP) residues that are decorated with&#160; d &#8208;alanine and&#160;  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208; d &#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, in a seemingly random manner. These WTA&#8208;modifications play an important role in shaping the interactions of WTA with the host immune system. Due to the structural heterogeneity of WTAs, it is impossible to isolate pure and well&#8208;defined WTA molecules from bacterial sources. Therefore, we here report synthetic chemistry to assemble a broad library of WTA&#8208;fragments, incorporating all possible glycosylation modifications ( &#945; &#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4;&#160; &#946; &#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4;&#160; &#946; &#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C3) described for&#160;  S. aureus  &#160;WTAs. We have used DNA&#8208;type chemistry, employing ribitol phosphoramidite building blocks, protected with a dimethoxy trityl group, to efficiently generate a library of WTA&#8208;hexamers. Automated solid phase syntheses were used to assemble a WTA&#8208;dodecamer and glycosylated WTA&#8208;hexamer. The synthetic fragments have been fully characterized and diagnostic signals were identified to discriminate the different glycosylation patterns. The different glycosylated WTA&#8208;fragments were used to probe binding of monoclonal antibodies using WTA&#8208;functionalized magnetic beads, revealing the binding specificity of these WTA&#8208;specific antibodies and the importance of the specific location of the GlcNAc modifications on the WTA&#8208;chains.</dc:description>

         <title>What is The Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can it be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arginine methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Some Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent Jumonji&#8208;C (JmjC) N&#949;&#8208;methyl lysine histone demethylases also have N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylase activity. We report combined molecular dynamic (MD) and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) studies on the mechanism of N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation by human KDM4E and compare the results with those reported for N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation by KDM4A. At the KDM4E active site, Glu191, Asn291, and Ser197 form a conserved scaffold that restricts substrate dynamics; substrate binding is also mediated by an out of active site hydrogen&#8208;bond between the substrate Ser1 and Tyr178.&#160;&#160;The calculations imply that in either C&#8208;H or N&#8208;H potential bond cleaving pathways for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation, electron transfer occurs via a &#963;&#8208;channel; the transition state for the N&#8208;H pathway is ~10 kcal/mol higher than for the C&#8208;H pathway due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the N&#8208;H bond. The results of applying external electric fields (EEFs) reveal EEFs with positive field strengths parallel to the Fe=O bond have a significant barrier&#8208;lowering effect on the C&#8208;H pathway, by contrast, such EEFs inhibit the N&#8208;H activation rate. The overall results imply that KDM4 catalyzed N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation and N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation occur via similar C&#8208;H abstraction and rebound mechanisms leading to methyl group hydroxylation, though there are differences in the interactions leading to productive binding of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Gold(I)&#8722;Trifluoromethyl Complexes and their Role in Generating Spectroscopic Evidence for a Gold(I)&#8722;Difluorocarbene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to access [Au(CF3)(NHC)] complexes has been developed, leading to the discovery of a new trimethylsilyl incorporated gold&#8722;NHC trifluoromethyl complex. This, in turn, led to the development of a new and straightforward strategy for the &#8220;one fluoride&#8221; abstraction affording, for the first time, spectroscopic evidence of the corresponding gold(I)&#8722;NHC difluorocarbene analogue.







Abstract
Readily prepared and bench&#8208;stable [Au(CF3)(NHC)] compounds were synthesized by using new methods, starting from [Au(OH)(NHC)], [Au(Cl)(NHC)] or [Au(L)(NHC)]HF2 precursors (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). The mechanism of formation of these species was investigated. Consequently, a new and straightforward strategy for the mild and selective cleavage of a single carbon/fluorine bond from [Au(CF3)(NHC)] complexes was attempted and found to be reversible in the presence of an additional nucleophilic fluoride source. This straightforward technique has led to the unprecedented spectroscopic observation of a gold(I)&#8722;NHC difluorocarbene species.

         <title>A Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Conjugated to a Coumarin Derivative Is a Potent Photodynamic Agent against Prostate Differentiated and Tumorigenic Cancer Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8208;COUPY, is a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. It efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk, differentiated and prostate, hardly treatable cancer stem cells simultaneously and with a similar efficacy. Thus, photo&#8208;induced therapy with IrIII&#8208;COUPY conjugates, such as photodynamic therapy, might provide a new approach for prostate cancer treatment.







Abstract
A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8208;COUPY (3), was recently shown as a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. Therefore, the primary goal of this work was to deepen knowledge on the mechanism of its photoactivated antitumor action so that this information could be used to propose a new class of compounds as drug candidates for curing very hardly treatable human tumors, such as androgen resistant prostatic tumors of metastatic origin. Conventional anticancer chemotherapies exhibit several disadvantages, such as limited efficiency to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are considered the main reason for chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Herein, we show, using DU145 tumor cells, taken as the model of hormone&#8208;refractory and aggressive prostate cancer cells resistant to conventional antineoplastic drugs, that the photoactivated conjugate 3 very efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk (differentiated) and prostate hardly treatable CSCs simultaneously and with a similar efficiency. Notably, the very low toxicity of IrIII&#8208;COUPY conjugate in the prostate DU145 cells in the dark and its pronounced selectivity for tumor cells compared with noncancerous cells could result in low side effects and reduced damage of healthy cells during the photoactivated therapy by this agent. Moreover, the experiments performed with the 3D spheroids formed from DU145 CSCs showed that conjugate 3 can penetrate the inner layers of tumor spheres, which might markedly increase its therapeutic effect. Also interestingly, this conjugate induces apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer DU145 cells associated with calcium signaling flux in these cells and autophagy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a photoactivatable metal&#8208;based compound is an efficient agent capable of killing even hardly treatable CSCs.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carbopentafluorophenylation of Alkynes: The Metallomimetic Pull&#8208;Push Reactivity of Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel three&#8208;component coupling of an allylsilane, an arylacetylene, and a C6F5 group from tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] is enabled by the pull&#8208;push reactivity of B(C6F5)3. Tetrafluoronaphthalenes can be prepared from the resultant C6F5&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes by a photochemical 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. The reaction using a 2&#8208;substituted furan or a silyl enolate instead of an allylsilane also affords a novel three&#8208;component coupling product.







Abstract
We report the novel single&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of an arylacetylene with an allylsilane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] involving C&#8722;C bond formation with C&#8722;H bond scission at the &#946;&#8208;position to the silicon atom of an allylsilane and B&#8594;C migration of a C6F5 group. The 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation occurs smoothly without the requirement for a catalyst or heating. Mechanistic studies suggest that the metallomimetic &#8220;pull&#8208;push&#8221; reactivity of B(C6F5)3 imparts consecutive electrophilic and nucleophilic characteristics to the benzylic carbon of the arylacetylene. Subsequent photochemical 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization affords tetrafluoronaphthalenes, which are important in the pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Owing to the unique reactivity of B(C6F5)3, the 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation using 2&#8208;substituted furan proceeded with ring opening, and the reaction using silyl enolates formed a C&#8722;C bond with C&#8722;O bond scission at the silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbon.

Silylene? NHO Problem! Access to a new lithiated anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) yields a complete acyclic divinyltetrelene series.







Abstract
The synthesis of the new bulky vinyllithium reagent (MeIPr=CH)Li, (MeIPr=[(MeCNDipp)2C]; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported. This vinyllithium precursor was found to act as a general source of the anionic 2&#963;, 2&#960;&#8208;electron donor ligand [MeIPr=CH]&#8722;. Furthermore, a high&#8208;yielding route to the degradation&#8208;resistant SiII precursor MeIPr&#8901;SiBr2 is presented. The efficacy of (MeIPr=CH)Li in synthesis was demonstrated by the generation of a complete inorganic divinyltetrelene series (MeIPrCH)2E: (E=Si to Pb). (MeIPrCH)2Si: represents the first two&#8208;coordinate acyclic silylene not bound by heteroatom donors, with dual electrophilic and nucleophilic character at the SiII center noted. Cyclic voltammetry shows this electron&#8208;rich silylene to be a potent reducing agent, rivalling the reducing power of the 19&#8208;electron complex cobaltocene (Cp2Co).

Systematic design and self&#8208;assembly of complex supramolecular coordination cages with predictable configurations has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in chemistry, which is as mysterious as the starry sky depicted in the cover image. This work reports a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V2E3 cage from two homoleptic cages with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. Moreover, SCC&#8208;2 cage possesses a cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Bai, Y.&#8208;F. Han, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100710).

         <title>Plant&#8208;Derived Stilbenoids as DNA&#8208;Binding Agents: From Monomers to Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stilbenoid (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from trans&#8208;resveratrol dimerization, binds to minor and major grooves of B&#8208;DNA, and to 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA by stacking on the outer quartets accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Consistent with the ability to tightly interact with different DNA secondary structures, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin shows DNA damaging activity.







Abstract
Stilbenoids are natural compounds endowed with several biological activities, including cardioprotection and cancer prevention. Among them, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from trans&#8208;resveratrol dimerization, was investigated in its ability to target DNA duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures by exploiting NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking. (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;Viniferin proved to bind both the minor and major grooves of duplexes, whereas it bound the 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of a G&#8208;quadruplex by stacking on the outer quartets, accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Specifically, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin demonstrated higher affinity for the investigated DNA targets than its monomeric counterpart. Additionally, the methoxylated derivatives of (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin and trans&#8208;resveratrol, i.&#8201;e. (&#177;)&#8208;pterostilbene&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrodimer and trans&#8208;pterostilbene, respectively, were evaluated, revealing similar binding modes, affinities and stoichiometries with the DNA targets as their parent analogues. All tested compounds were cytotoxic at &#956;M concentration on several cancer cell lines, showing DNA damaging activity consistent with their ability to tightly interact with duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures.

         <title>Sustainable and Robust Graphene Cellulose Paper Decorated with Lithiophilic Au Nanoparticles to Enable Dendrite&#8208;free and High&#8208;Power Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable graphene cellulose paper decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles provides abundant nucleation sites and guarantees uniform Li deposition. And the large specific surface area of cellulose paper lowers local current density and avoids concentration polarization near the surface of electrode. Meanwhile, cellulose paper scaffold with good mechanical strength substantially alleviates the volume expansion of metal Li. Benefited from the synergy between Au nanoparticles and cellulose paper, the electrochemical performance of the Au&#8722;GCP electrode is significantly improved even at high current density.







Abstract
Lithium metal anodes (LMAs) with high energy density have recently captured increasing attention for development of next&#8208;generation batteries. However, practical viability of LMAs is hindered by the uncontrolled Li dendrite growth and infinite dimension change. Even though constructing 3D conductive skeleton has been regarded as a reliable strategy to prepare stable and low volume stress LMAs, engineering the renewable and lithiophilic conductive scaffold is still a challenge. Herein, a robust conductive scaffold derived from renewable cellulose paper, which is coated with reduced graphene oxide and decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles, is engineered for LMAs. The graphene cellulose fibres with high surface area can reduce the local current density, while the well&#8208;dispersed Au nanoparticles can serve as lithiophilic nanoseeds to lower the nucleation overpotential of Li plating. The coupled relationship can guarantee uniform Li nucleation and unique spherical Li growth into 3D carbon matrix. Moreover, the natural cellulose paper possesses outstanding mechanical strength to tolerate the volume stress. In virtue of the modulated deposition behaviour and near&#8208;zero volume change, the hybrid LMAs can achieve reversible Li plating/stripping even at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as evidenced by high Coulombic efficiency (97.2&#8201;% after 60&#8197;cycles) and ultralong lifespan (1000&#8197;cycles) together with ultralow overpotential (25&#8197;mV). Therefore, this strategy sheds light on a scalable approach to multiscale design versatile Li host, promising highly stable Li metal batteries to be feasible and practical.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable copper(I) coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) are self&#8208;assembled in water and they display solvent composition&#8208;responsive behavior that can be followed by emission of the aggregates. The dramatic differences in the emission energy and the morphology of the aggregates have been attributed to changes in the coordination sphere around the copper centers.







Abstract
Luminescent copper(I)&#8208;based compounds have recently attracted much attention since they can reach very high emission quantum yields. Interestingly, Cu(I) clusters can also be emissive, and the extension from small molecules to larger architecture could represent the first step towards novel materials that could be obtained by programming the units to undergo self&#8208;assembly. However, for Cu(I) compounds the formation of supramolecular systems is challenging due to the coordinative diversity of copper centers. This works shows that this diversity can be exploited in the construction of responsive systems. In detail, the changes in the emissive profile of different aggregates formed in water by phosphine&#8208;thioether copper(I) derivatives were followed. Our results demonstrate that the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of Cu(I)&#8208;based coordination polymeric nanoparticles (CPNs) is sensitive to solvent composition. The solvent&#8208;induced changes are related to modifications in the coordination sphere of copper at the molecular level, which alters not only the emission profile but also the morphology of the aggregates. Our findings are expected to inspire the construction of smart supramolecular systems based on dynamic coordinative metal centers.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant molecules self&#8208;assemble into long&#8208;range ordered lamellar structures in bulk with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3 nm), driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics of crystallization for the vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. This crystallization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy may offer an opportunity to create integrated circuits (ICs) with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes by lithographic techniques for the microelectronic industry. More information can be found in the Communication by Z.&#8208;H. Guo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100638).

         <title>Unveiling the Hidden &#963;&#8208;Dimerization of a Kinetically Protected Olympicenyl Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto undetected &#963;&#8208;dimerization pathway in an olympicenyl system was revealed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Theoretical calculations gave clear structural and energetic profiles for the &#963;&#8208;dimerization, and regioselective oxidation of the olympicenyl radical afforded biolympicenylidene with significant singlet diradical character and high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization.







Abstract
The &#963;&#8208;dimer of a kinetically protected olympicenyl radical, which evaded the experimental detection, was revealed by conversion into biolympicenylidene with E&#8208;configuration in a regioselective manner. The complicated stereochemistry and energetics of the &#963;&#8208;dimers derived from C2v symmetry and uneven spin distribution of the olympicenyl radical were revealed by the theoretical calculations, and the energetic preference of &#960;&#8208;dimer over &#963;&#8208;dimer by a minute gap was disclosed. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene, a polycyclic ene structure previously considered as reactive intermediate in the phenalenyl radical system, exhibited exceptional stability, which allowed for a detailed investigation on its singlet diradical character and physical properties by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption/emission spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and assisted by theoretical calculations. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene showed high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization reactions, which was attributed to high activation energies for the rate&#8208;determining electrocyclization operated on both disrotatory and conrotatory mode, as well as a small spin density at the bonding sites for the radical&#8208;radical coupling process.

         <title>Supramolecular Alloys from Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular alloy, freely composed of eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination can be created with high crystallinity. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, gaining control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process was achieved by carefully controlling the feed ratio.







Abstract
To create innovative materials, efficient control and engineering of pore sizes and their characteristics, crystallinity and stability is required. Eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage are investigated. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, it was possible to gain control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process, by carefully controlling the feed ratio. This represents the first hybrid material based on fluorinated/hydrogenated porous organic cages (POCs). These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming alloys. All mixtures and the fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage were analyzed by MALDI&#8208;MS, single&#8208;crystal XRD, powder XRD and in regard to thermal stability (TGA).

         <title>Bis(Iminophosphorano)&#8208;Substituted Pyridinium Ions and their Corresponding Bispyridinylidene Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized synthetic routes to pyridinium ions featuring two strongly &#960;&#8208;donating R3P=N&#8722; substituents are presented. These substituents cause severe disruption in aromaticity in these cations, and also impart exceptional reducing ability to the related bispyridinylidenes (neutral 2 e&#8208; donors). Preliminary reactivity studies show some enhanced reducing capabilities owing to the low redox potential of the bispyridinylidene.







Abstract
Optimized synthetic procedures for pyridinium ions featuring iminophosphorano (&#8722;N=PR3; R=Ph, Cy) &#960;&#8208;donor substituents in the 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; positions are described. Crystallographic and theoretical studies reveal that the strongly donating substituents severely polarize the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the pyridyl ring at the expense of aromaticity. Moreover, the pyridinium ions are readily deprotonated to generate powerful bispyridinylidene (BPY) organic electron donors. Electrochemical studies show exceptionally low redox potentials for the two&#8208;electron BPY/BPY2+ couples, ranging from &#8722;1.71&#8197;V vs the saturated calomel electrode for 3PhPh (with four Ph3P=N&#8722; groups) to &#8722;1.85&#8197;V for 3CyCy (with four Cy3P=N&#8722; groups). These new compounds represent the most reducing neutral organic electron donors (OEDs) currently known. Some preliminary reductions involving 3CyCy showed enhanced capability owing to its low redox potential, such as the thermally activated reduction of an aryl chloride, but purification challenges were often encountered.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Pentafluorosulfanylative Domino Cyclization of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Alkenes to Oxaheterocycles by Using SF6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let's play dominoes with SF6: The photoredox catalytic activation of SF6 in the presence of a&#8208;substituted styrenes and alkynols initiates a reaction sequence that consecutively forms a C&#8722;O bond, a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;SF5 bond, one after another. Finally, this domino reaction yields pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step. These new compounds bear a complex structure and broaden the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks for chemical synthesis in the future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let's play dominoes with SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;: The photoredox catalytic activation of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of a&#8208;substituted styrenes and alkynols initiates a reaction sequence that consecutively forms a C&#8722;O bond, a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; bond, one after another. Finally, this domino reaction yields pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step. These new compounds bear a complex structure and broaden the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks for chemical synthesis in the future.

Let it click in UHV: a click chemistry reaction suitable for application under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions was developed based on enolether/tetrazine coupling. It is orthogonal to the strain&#8208;promoted cycloaddition of cyclooctynes to azides and allows for tailored layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer synthesis on highly reactive semiconductor surfaces such as Si(001) seen through the window of a UHV apparatus.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach to Multilayer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality has existed in nature from the early stages of life on Earth. A new form of chirality, multilayer 3D chirality, has been established involving nearly parallel patterns. This work presents the first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality. New complexes of Pd and chiral amide&#8208;phosphine ligands were utilized as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling for assembling various multilayer 3D chiral molecules, which displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of different colors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100700).

         <title>CeCoOx core / Nb2O5@TiO2 Double Shell Nanocage Catalyst Demonstrates High Activity and Water Resistance for Catalytic Combustion of O&#8208;dichlorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have successfully prepared a series of catalysts with different core&#8208;shell structures via hydrothermal method. They were consisted of CeCoOx@TiO2 (single shell), CeCoOx@Nb2O5 (single shell) and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 (double shell) core&#8208;shell nanocages and CeCoOx nanocages, in which CeCoOx was core and TiO2 and Nb2O5 were shell. Then, the influence of core&#8208;shell structure on the catalytic performance of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene was investigated by activity, water&#8208;resistance, thermal stability test and catalyst characterization. The temperature corresponding to 90% conversion of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (T90) of CeCoOx, CeCoOx@TiO2, CeCoOx@Nb2O5 and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts was 415, 383, 362 and 367 &#176;C, respectively. CeCoOx@Nb2O5 exhibited the excellent catalytic activity, mainly owing to the special core&#8208;shell structure, large specific surface area, abundant activity species of Co3+, Ce3+, Nb5+, strong reducibility and more active oxygen vacancies. It can be seen that the Nb2O5 coating can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In addition, due to the protective effect of TiO2 shell on CeCoOx, CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts exhibited the outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability within 1200 minutes. The T90 of CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 was slightly lower than that of CeCoOx@Nb2O5, but it had higher stability and hydrothermal stability. Furthermore, the possible reaction pathway involving the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (MvK) and Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8208;H) models were deduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing the Red&#8208;Ox Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, may have important application in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, we obtained a new charge transfer MOF ( Co&#8208;MOF ) with mixed ligands of H 4 TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating red&#8208;ox active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. Additionally, the charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) units results in a broad absorption in NIR region. Co&#8208;MOF exhibited the efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiating with NIR laser. Under the 808 nm laser (0.5 W cm &#8722;2 ) illumination, the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF promptly increases from room temperature to 151.7 &#176;C in only 10 s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amount of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. Irradiated by 808 nm laser with power of 0.5 W cm &#8722;2 , the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6 wt%) film can reach a plateau at 62 &#176;C from 20 &#176;C within 100 s. Our experimental results from Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrates that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material in promising photothermal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reentrant Photoinduced Morphological Transformation and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Kinetic Products of a Rectangular&#8208;Shaped Amphiphilic Diarylethene Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains and two hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) chains was synthesized, and its photoinduced morphological transformation in water was investigated. Two unexpected phenomena were revealed in the course of the experiments: a reentrant photoinduced macroscopic morphological transformation and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic products of supramolecular assembly. When the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was dispersed in water, its reentrant photoinduced morphological transformation, i.e., photoinduced transition from the hydrated phase to the dehydrated phase and then back to the hydrated phase, was observed by optical microscopy upon irradiation with green light at 20 &#176;C, which was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. The aqueous assembly of the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was controlled by changing the temperature; specifically, rapid cooling to 15 and 5 &#176;C gave J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates, respectively, as the kinetic products. The thermodynamic product at both temperatures was a mixture of mostly H&#8208;aggregate with a small amount of J&#8208;aggregate. This behavior was rationalized by the temperature&#8208;dependent potential energy surface of the supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Ortho&#8208;Directed Dicarboxylation of Cyclopentadiene by Methylcarbonates and CO2 or COS &#8211; First Insight into Co&#8208;ordination Chemistry of New Ambident Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated and &#8208;dithiocarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of organic cation methylcarbonate salts Cat[OCO2Me] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, EMMIm+) with cyclopentadiene or by reaction of CO2/COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, PPh4+) was developed. First insight into their coordination chemistry reveals ambident ligand behaviour following Pearsons acid&#8208;base concept. In some reactions with metal Lewis acids, a slow decarboxylation of the [C5H3(CO2)2H] ligand was observed. The mechanism is discussed.







Abstract
This research presents the highly regioselective syntheses of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of a variety of organic cation methylcarbonate salts [Cat]OCO2Me (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with cyclopentadiene (CpH) or by simply reacting organic cation cyclopentadienides Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with CO2. One characteristic feature of these dianionic ligands is the acidic proton delocalized in an intramolecular hydrogen bridge (IHB) between the two carboxyl groups, as studied by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and XRD analyses. The reaction cannot be stopped after the first carboxylation. Therefore, we propose a Kolbe&#8208;Schmitt phenol&#8208;carboxylation related mechanism where the acidic proton of the monocarboxylic acid intermediate plays an ortho&#8208;directing and CO2 activating role for the second kinetically accelerated CO2 addition step exclusively in ortho position. The same and related thiocarboxylates [Cat]2[C5H3(COS)2H] are obtained by reaction of COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+). A preliminary study on [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] reveals, that its soft and hard coordination sites can selectively be addressed by soft Lewis acids (Mo0, Ru2+) and hard Lewis acids (Al3+, La3+).

         <title>Forever Young: Structural Stability of Telomeric Guanine Quadruplexes in the Presence of Oxidative DNA Lesions**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The structural stability of guanine quadruplexes in the presence of oxidative lesions is revealed using molecular dynamics simulations, CD spectroscopy and immunofluorescence.







Abstract
Human telomeric DNA, in G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) conformation, is characterized by a remarkable structural stability that confers it the capacity to resist to oxidative stress producing one or even clustered 8&#8208;oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesions. We present a combined experimental/computational investigation, by using circular dichroism in aqueous solutions, cellular immunofluorescence assays and molecular dynamics simulations, that identifies the crucial role of the stability of G4s to oxidative lesions, related also to their biological role as inhibitors of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in most cancers associated to oxidative stress.

Excitation, delocalization, emission: Molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping. Crystals exhibit prominent dual emission caused by the intramolecular excitation and intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated exciton delocalization along the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing direction.







Abstract
A series of new [2,2]fluorenophanes has been synthesized and characterized; among them, molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping. This, in combination with the synergistic intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, leads to prominent dual emission mediated by charge transfer (CT) exciton delocalization. Support of this new insight is given by mapping the transition density along the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing direction where the intramolecular excitation and intermolecular CT coexist in K2C&#8208;2.

Starting from a fullerene&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene derivative, this new strategy gave easy access to a photoactive [2]rotaxane incorporating a C60 moiety and two Bodipy stoppers.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Thin Films of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 by Coordination Modulated Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>

         <dc:description>
Dense, crack&#8208;free, and crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films were grown on silicon dioxide surfaces by coordination modulated liquid phase epitaxy (CM&#8208;LPE). In a stepwise process, the substrate was alternatively immersed in Zr6O4(OH)4(OMc)12 and H2&#8208;bdc&#8208;NH2 ethanol solutions which both contain methacrylic acid as a coordination modulator. For optimal thin film quality, the ideal activation of the SiO2 substrate prior to the thin film growth is key, whereby piranha acid is superior to ozone treatment.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of macroscopically and microscopically homogeneous, crack&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (UiO: Universitetet i Oslo; [Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6]; bdc&#8208;NH22&#8722;: 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate) thin films on silicon oxide surfaces. A DMF&#8208;free, low&#8208;temperature coordination modulated (CM), layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) using the controlled secondary building block approach (CSA). Efficient substrate activation was determined as a key factor to obtain dense and smooth coatings by comparing UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films grown on ozone and piranha acid&#8208;activated substrates. Films of 2.60&#8197;&#956;m thickness with a minimal surface roughness of 2&#8197;nm and a high sorption capacity of 3.53&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 MeOH (at 25&#8201;&#176;C) were typically obtained in an 80&#8208;cycle experiment at mild conditions (70&#8201;&#176;C, ambient pressure).

         <title>Quadruply BN&#8208;Fused Tetrathia[8]circulenes with Flexible Frameworks: Synthesis, Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruply BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes were synthesized through four&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulene exhibits crystal polymorphism, in which the circulene core adopts both planar and saddle conformations in the solid state. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the weaker aromaticity of azaborine compared with benzene renders the flexibility to the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes.

         <title>Racemic Tartrate/Malate Anions Combine with Racemic Complex Cations to Form Optically Active Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;AgI3RhIII2 complex cations with racemic RR/SS&#8208;tartrate gave a single conglomerate containing a pair of enantiomers &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS and &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR on crystallization. While similar treatment using racemic R/S&#8208;malate also gave a single conglomerate, the enantiomers produced have opposite chiralities of &#923;&#923;&#8208;S and &#916;&#916;&#8208;R. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the S form of natural malate, which is opposite to the RR form of natural tartrate. The presence of S&#8208;aspartate led to preferential crystallization of one enantiomer &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS or &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR dependent on the solution pH.







Abstract
Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur's work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, a unique example of this phenomenon is reported, involving ionic crystals generated from racemic RR/SS&#8208; tartrate or R/S&#8208;malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ag3Rh2(2&#8208;aminoethanethiolato)6]3+ (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+) in water. RR&#8208; and SS&#8208;tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916; isomers of [1]3+ to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(RR&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(SS&#8208;tartrate)3, respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution. While spontaneous resolution also occurs when using R/S&#8208;malate, R&#8208; and S&#8208;malate select the opposite isomers of [1]3+ to give ionic crystals of (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;malate)3 and (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;malate)3, respectively. In the presence of S&#8208;aspartate, (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;tartrate)3 are preferentially crystallized from &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+ and RR/SS&#8208;tartrate at solution pH values of 6 and 10, respectively. This finding provides significant insight into the optical resolution of chemical species by spontaneous resolution and the origin of homochirality in nature.

         <title>Effect of Manganese Valence on Specific Capacitance in Supercapacitors of Manganese Oxide Microspheres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effect of manganese valence on specific capacitance: Hierarchical manganese oxides microspheres were prepared by hydrothermal and calcination methods. Mn2O3 exhibited Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ transitions during the charge/discharge process. The redox reaction equations of Mn2O3 was proposed based on the electrochemical measurements. Mn2O3 exhibited superior specific capacitance due to the two redox couples and unique structure.







Abstract
Manganese oxides have attracted great interest in electrochemical energy storage due to high theoretical specific capacitance and abundant valence states. The multiple valence states in the redox reactions are beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical properties. Herein, three manganese microspheres were prepared by a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination at different temperatures using carbon spheres as templates. The trivalent manganese of Mn2O3 exhibited multiple redox transitions of Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ during the intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte ions. The possible redox reactions of Mn2O3 were proposed based on the cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammogram results. Mn2O3 microsphere integrated the advantages of multiple redox couples and unique structure, demonstrating a high specific capacitance and long cycling stability. The symmetric Mn2O3//Mn2O3 device yielded a maximum energy density of 29.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Uniform Nanowires Containing a Heterogeneous&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Core of Controlled Length, Composition and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunction nanowires containing a heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology were generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding and &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221;&#8208;seeded growth approaches in spite of distinct molecular size and conformation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units.







Abstract
In this work, it is demonstrated for the first time that heterojunction nanowires, consisting of a gradient and segmented&#8208;like heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core with controllable length, composition and morphology, can be generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding of oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (OPV)&#8208; and oligo(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (OPE)&#8208;containing block copolymers in spite of different chain lengths and molecular conformation for OPE and OPV. More importantly, based on the understanding of the formation of heterogeneous core by the co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding approach, a &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221; seeded growth route was developed, by which linear and branched heterojunction nanowires containing a segmented heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology can be obtained. This work provides a versatile platform to generate heterojunction nanowires with excellent controllability in length, composition, and morphology.

         <title>Hydrophobic POM Electrocatalyst Achieves Low Voltage &#8220;Charge&#8221; in Zn&#8208;Air Battery Coupled with Bisphenol A Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled with hydrophobic polyoxometalates (POM) as cathode material. Compared with common Zn&#8208;air battery, the &#8220;charge&#8221; voltage of this battery decreases very clearly.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;air batteriesare a perspective power source for grid&#8208;storage. But, after they are discharged at1.1 to 1.2&#8197;V, large overpotential is required for their charging (usually 2.5&#8197;V). This is due to a sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Incorporating organic pollutants into the cathode electrolyte is a feasible strategy for lowering the required charging potential. In the discharge process, the related oxygen reduction reaction, hydrophobic electrocatalysts are more popular than hydrophilic ones. Here, a hydrophobic bifunctional polyoxometalate electrocatalyst is synthesized by precise structural design. It shows excellent activities in both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions. In bisphenol A containing electrolyte, to achieve 100&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, its potential is only 1.32&#8197;V, which is 0.34&#8197;V lower than oxygen evolution reaction. In the oxygen reduction reaction, this electrocatalyst follows the four&#8208;electron mechanism. In both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions, it shows excellent stability. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and bisphenol A containing KOH as electrolyte, a Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled. When &#8220;charged&#8221; at 85&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it only requires 1.98&#8197;V. Peak power density of this Zn&#8208;air battery reaches 120.5&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, in the &#8220;charge&#8221; process, bisphenol A is degraded, which achieves energy saving and pollutant removal simultaneously in one Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Urease Reaction in Controlling Properties of Supramolecular Hydrogels: Pros and Cons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autocatalytic reaction between urease and urea produces ammonia in aqueous medium which increases the pH. Here, we summarize how the urea&#8208;urease reaction can be used to control hydrogel properties. The advantages and limitations of this method compared to conventional methods of pH increase are also discussed.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are useful in many areas such as cell culturing, catalysis, sensing, tissue engineering, drug delivery, environmental remediation and optoelectronics. The gels need specific properties for each application. The properties arise from a fibrous network that forms the matrix. A common method to prepare hydrogels is to use a pH change. Most methods result in a sudden pH jump and often lead to gels that are hard to reproduce and control. The urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used to control hydrogel properties by a uniform and controlled pH increase as well as to set up pH cycles. The reaction involves hydrolysis of urea by urease and production of ammonia which increases the pH. The rate of ammonia production can be controlled which can be used to prepare gels with differing properties. Herein, we show how the urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used for the construction of next generation functional materials.

         <title>RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga): New Double&#8208;Layered Oxyborates Constructed from [BO3] Triangles and [TO4] Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered configuration in SBBO crystals gives them excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. Here, four new alumino&#8208;/galloborates with the general formula RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga) have been synthesized by using a high&#8208;temperature solution method. They have SBBO&#8208;like structures formed by the [BO3] triangles and [TO4] tetrahedra.







Abstract
Four new alumino&#8208;/galloborates RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga) have been synthesized for the first time by using a high&#8208;temperature solution method. All the title compounds have Sr2Be2B2O7&#8208;like structures, in which the [BO3] triangles and [TO4] tetrahedra form the final double&#8208;layered configurations with the M&#8208; and Rb&#8208;site atoms located between and in the double layer, respectively. The structure evolution from Sr2Be2B2O7 to RbMT3(BO3)2O3 series is discussed. The broader energy bandgaps in Al&#8208;based borates when compared with Ga&#8208;based ones can be entirely attributed to the location of Al/Ga s orbitals near the Fermi surface. Both experimental and computational approaches were used to study their structure&#8208;property relationships.

&lt;p&gt;Four new alumino&#8208;/galloborates RbMT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga) have been synthesized for the first time by using a high&#8208;temperature solution method. All the title compounds have Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;like structures, in which the [BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] triangles and [TO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] tetrahedra form the final double&#8208;layered configurations with the M&#8208; and Rb&#8208;site atoms located between and in the double layer, respectively. The structure evolution from Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; to RbMT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; series is discussed. The broader energy bandgaps in Al&#8208;based borates when compared with Ga&#8208;based ones can be entirely attributed to the location of Al/Ga s orbitals near the Fermi surface. Both experimental and computational approaches were used to study their structure&#8208;property relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Oxidative Coordination versus C3&#8722;C(O)Me Bond Cleavage in Acetylacetonate Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key role of olefin co&#8208;ligands in the reactivity of IrI precursors toward alkylidenediketone, pyCH=C(COMe)2, is shown. In this regard, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and cyclooctene induce the oxidative coordination of the above&#8208;mentioned alkylidenediketone, leading to the formation of new iridabicyclic complexes. By contrast, dimethylbutadiene promotes at room temperature C3&#8722;COMe bond cleavage of the alkylidenediketone.







Abstract
Iridabicycles [Ir{&#954;3&#8208;N,C,O&#8208;(pyC(H)=C(C(O)Me)2}(Cl)(L&#8722;L)](L&#8722;L=cod (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), 1&#8201;a; bipy (bipy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), 1&#8201;b) have been obtained by oxidative coordination of 3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methylene)pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione L1, to the complexes [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(cod)}2] and [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(coe)2}2] (coe=cis&#8208;cyclooctene), the latter in the presence of bipy. Remarkably, cleavage of the C3&#8722;C(O)Me bond of L1 has instead been achieved in the reaction with [Ir(Cl)(dmb)2] (dmb=2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene), yielding a compound formulated as [Ir{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me))}(CO)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(Me)]2, 2. Treatment of dimer 2 with DMSO or PMe3 produced the complexes[Ir{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me)}(CO)Cl(Me)L] (L=DMSO, 3&#8201;a; PMe3, 3&#8201;b). Plausible mechanisms for the reactions leading to complexes 1 and 2 are proposed by means of DFT calculations.

         <title>Polyoxotungstate Archetype {P4W27} and its 3d Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
{P4W27} represents an extended and stabilized version of the elusive V&#8208;shaped dimer {P2W12}2, derived from the seminal Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type phosphotungstate archetype, and offers a coordination pocket that can induce unusual oxygen coordination polyhedra, such as a trigonal prism for MnII.







Abstract
The propensity of the new, phenylphosphonate&#8208;stabilized polyoxotungstate [(C6H5PVO)2P4W24O92]16&#8722; to act as a precursor for new 3d metal&#8208;functionalized polyanions has been investigated. Reactions with MnII and CuII induce the formation of the previously unknown polyoxotungstate archetype {P4W27}, isolated as salts of the polyanions [Na&#8834;{MnII(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]13&#8722; (1) and [K&#8834;{CuII(H2O)}{W(OH)(H2O)}P4W27O99]14&#8722; (2), which were characterized in the solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, elemental and TG analyses, IR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry) and in aqueous solution (UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry).

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flower for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)  2  with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)  2  nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)  2  obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25 M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this  ex situ  conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3,3&#8208;Disubstituted oxindoles bearing quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers are privileged structural motifs, which widely exist in pharmaceutical and natural products. Herein, we describe a highly regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkyl oxindoles through synergistic iridium and copper catalysis, providing a series of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives containing adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in excellent yields, enantiomeric excess, and diastereomeric ratio (for 30 examples, up to 97% yield, &gt;99% ee, and &gt;20:1 dr). This method provides exclusive branched selectivity, excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, and good functional compatibility. Control experiments suggested that the chiral copper catalyst is required for achieving high reactivities and diastereoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Deuteration and Hydrodeuteration: Emerging Techniques to Selectively Transform Alkenes and Alkynes to Deuterated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules has spurred a renewed interest in selective methods for deuterium installation. Catalytic transfer deuteration and transfer hydrodeuteration are emerging as powerful techniques for the selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules. These reactions not only obviate the use of D  2  &#160;gas and pressurized reaction setups but provide new opportunities for selectively installing deuterium into small molecules. Commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are typically employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. In this minireview, we will discuss recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes and alkynes for the selective synthesis of deuterated alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Externally Regulated Specific Molecular Recognition Driven Pathway Selectivity in Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reveals 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene&#8208;diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI&#8208;1 produces ill&#8208;defined aggregate (Agg&#8208;1) due to different H&#8208;bonding motifs of the &#8208;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI&#8208;1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J&#8208;aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg&#8208;2). With 10% DMAP and fast cooling (10K/ min), similar nucleation and open chain H&#8208;bonding with the free monomer in an anti&#8208;parallel arrangement produces identical J&#8208;aggregate (Agg&#8208;2a). With 2.5% DMAP and slow cooling (1K/ min), a distinct nucleation and supramolecular polymerization pathway emerge leading to the thermodynamically controlled Agg&#8208;3 with face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking and 2D&#8208;morphology. Slow cooling with 5&#8208;10% DMAP produces a mixture of Agg&#8208;2a and Agg&#8208;3. Computational modelling studies provide valuable insights into the internal order and the pathway complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Topology Structure on Photodynamic Sterilization of Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising photosensitizers due to no self&#8208;aggregation of porphyrin in aqueous solution. However, how the topology of porphyrinic MOFs affects the generation of singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) is unclear. Here, we report the effect of the topology of porphyrinic MOFs on their photodynamic performance. To this end, four porphyrinic zirconium MOFs (MOF&#8208;525, MOF&#8208;545, PCN&#8208;223 and PCN&#8208;224 with different topologies (  ftw  ,  csq  ,  shp  and  she  respectively)) were selected to study the influence of topology on the photodynamic antibacterial performance. The  1  O  2  generation and the photodynamic antibacterial performance followed an decreasing order of MOF&#8208;545&gt;MOF&#8208;525&gt;PCN&#8208;224&gt;PCN&#8208;223. The results reveal that the pore size, the distance between porphyrin and the number of porphyrin per Zr  6  O  8  cluster in MOFs greatly affected the  1  O  2  generation. This work provide a guidance for designing new MOFs for efficient photodynamic sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure polyradical tetrahedral Pd12L6&#160;cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of cages with polyradical framework remains a challenging task. Here we report an enantiomeric pair of quinoid&#8208;bridged polyradical tetrahedral palladium (II) cages that are stabilized by an unusual dianionic diradical (dhbq&#183;&#183;  2&#8208;  ) form. These cages have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, squid magnetometry and mass spectrometry. Single crystal derived X&#8208;ray structural investigations of the iso&#8208;structural cages built on flouranilate linkers confirm the tetrahedral structure of the obtained radical cages. Theoretical calculations showed that the diradical state is more stable than the usual monoradical state of the dhbq anions. A weak ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent radical centres has been observed in the DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic perturbations from the protein affect C&#8208;H bond strengths of the substrate and enable negative catalysis in the TmpA biosynthesis enzyme.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron dioxygenase 2&#8208;(trimethylammonio)&#8208;ethylphosphonate dioxygenase (TmpA) is an enzyme involved in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective hydroxylation at the C  1  &#8208;position of the substrate as part of the biosynthesis of glycine betaine in bacteria and carnitine in humans. To understand how the enzyme avoids breaking the weak C  2  &#8208;H bond in favor of C  1  &#8208;hydroxylation, we set up a cluster model of 242 atoms representing the first and second&#8208;coordination sphere of the metal center and substrate binding pocket and investigated possible reaction mechanisms of substrate activation by an iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species by density functional theory methods. In agreement with experimental product distributions, the calculations predict a favorable C  1  &#8208;hydroxylation pathway. The calculations show that the selectivity is guided through electrostatic perturbations inside the protein from charged residues, external electric fields and electric dipole moments. In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C  1  &#8208;H and C  2  &#8208;H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C  2  &#8208;H bond in the substrate&#8208;bound orientation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(trifluoromethyl)amido Complexes of Copper and Silver:&#160;Stable and storable N(CF3)2&#160;transfer reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agro&#173;che&#173;micals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)&#173;&#173;amino group is an example for a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing per&#173;fluoro&#173;alkyl, perfluoro&#173;alkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, exampl&#173;es with the N(CF3)2&#160;group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Here, we present a set of CuI&#160;and AgI&#160;bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with un&#173;pre&#173;ce&#173;&#173;dented stability. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleo&#173;philic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)&#173;&#173;amino acetate was obtained that upon hydrolysis gives the fluorinated amino acid&#160;N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido&#8208;Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8208; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide ions are particularly well&#8208;suited for the design of single&#8208;molecule magnets owing to their large unquenched orbital angular momentum and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling that gives rise to high magnetic anisotropy. Such nanoscopic bar magnets can potentially revolutionize high&#8208;density information storage and processing technologies if blocking temperatures can be increased substantially. Exploring non&#8208;classical ligand scaffolds with the aim to boost the barriers to spin&#8208;relaxation are prerequisite. Here, the synthesis, crystallographic and magnetic characterization of a series of each isomorphous mono&#8208; and dinuclear lanthanide (Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) complexes comprising tetraimido sulfate ligands are presented. The dinuclear Dy complex [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2Dy&#173;Cl2}2&#8226;ClLi(thf)2] (1c) shows true signatures of single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior in the absence of a dc field. In addition, the mononuclear Dy and Tb complexes [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2LnCl2(thf)2] (2b,c) show slow magnetic relaxation under applied dc fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards DNA&#8208;encoded Micellar Chemistry: DNA&#8208;micelle Association and Environment&#8208;sensitivity of Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reaction methodologies is a central theme to advance DNA&#8208;encoded screening library technology. Recently, we could show that sulfonic acid functionalized block copolymer micelles facilitated Br&#248;nsted acid promoted reactions such as the Povarov reaction on DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials with minimal DNA degradation. Here, we investigated the impact of polymer composition on micelle shape, and reaction conversion. A dozen sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymers of different molar mass and composition were prepared by RAFT&#8208;polymerization and were tested in the Povarov reaction, removal of the Boc protective group, and the Biginelli reaction. The results showed trends of polymer structure &#8208; micellar catalytic activity relationship. For instance, micelles composed of block copolymers with shorter acrylate ester chains formed smaller particles and tended to provide faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that DNA&#8208;oligomer&#8208;conjugates, although highly water&#8208;soluble, accumulated very effectively in the micellar compartments as an essential prerequisite for carrying out a DNA&#8208;encoded reaction in the presence of polymer micelles.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, we report the synthesis of new  N  &#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds. Solid state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8208;C  alkyne  bond lengths allowed assessing the  trans  &#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the  N  &#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the  O  &#8208;based EBX reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Synthesis of Arylsulfonyl Fluorides: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to success in the new metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides was using cyanoarene PC3 as organo&#8208;photocatalyst. A variety of arene diazonium slats were smoothly converted to the corresponding product. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence, EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculation allowed us to identify several key intermediates and propose a plausible mechanism.







Abstract
The first metal&#8208;free procedure for the synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides is reported. Under organo&#8208;photoredox conditions, aryl diazonium salts react with a readily available SO2 source (DABSO) to afford the desired product through simple nucleophilic fluorination. The reaction tolerates the presence of both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aryls and demonstrated a broad functional group tolerance. To shed the light on the reaction mechanism, several experimental techniques were combined, including fluorescence, NMR, and EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Spectroscopic Studies of Synthetic Methylaluminoxane: Structure of Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrolysis of Me6Al2 using hydrated salts, or reaction of Me6Al2 with trimethylboroxine affords methylaluminoxane (MAO) with different ESI&#8208;MS spectra, NMR spectra and residual Me3Al content. Unlike commercial MAO, which upon treatment with donors, consists mainly of a single anionic species [(MeAlO)16(Me3Al)6Me]&#8722;=[16,6]&#8722;, synthetic MAO can differ significantly in its ion&#8208;pair speciation. Theory suggests the ion&#8208;pair precursors have sheet structures.







Abstract
Hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum (Me3Al) in polar solvents can be monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) using the donor additive octamethyltrisiloxane [(Me3SiO)2SiMe2, OMTS]. Using hydrated salts, hydrolytic methylaluminoxane (h&#8208;MAO) features different anion distributions, depending on the conditions of synthesis, and different activator contents as measured by NMR spectroscopy. Non&#8208;hydrolytic MAO was prepared using trimethylboroxine. The properties of this material, which contains incorporated boron, differ significantly from h&#8208;MAO. In the case of MAO prepared by direct hydrolysis, oligomeric anions are observed to rapidly form, and then more slowly evolve into a mixture dominated by an anion with m/z 1375 with formula [(MeAlO)16(Me3Al)6Me]&#8722;. Theoretical calculations predict that sheet structures with composition (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m are favoured over other motifs for MAO in the size range suggested by the ESI&#8208;MS experiments. A possible precursor to the m/z 1375 anion is a local minimum based on the free energy released upon hydrolysis of Me3Al.

In the case of MAO prepared by direct hydrolysis, oligomeric anions are observed to rapidly form, and then more slowly evolve into a mixture dominated by an anion with &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; 1375 with formula [(MeAlO)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Me]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical calculations predict that sheet structures with composition (MeAlO)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al)&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are favoured over other motifs for MAO in the size range suggested by the ESI&#8208;MS experiments. A possible precursor to the &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; 1375 anion is a local minimum based on the free energy released upon hydrolysis of Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hypervalent&#8208;Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Tandem Oxidative Dearomatization/Aziridination of Phenolic Amines: Synthesis of Functionalized Unactivated Aziridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tandem reaction (oxidative dearomatization/aziridination) of phenolic amines in the presence of hypervalent&#8208;iodine(III) reagent is described. This cascade reaction shows a chemical unification of the oxidative reactivity of phenol and aliphatic primary amine in the chemistry of dearomatization and aziridination, thus providing a new method for the synthesis of unactivated aziridines with dense functionalization.







Abstract
A new hypervalent&#8208;iodine(III)&#8208;mediated tandem reaction involving oxidative dearomatization and in&#8197;situ aziridination of phenolic amines is described, providing a mild and effective method for the assembly of structurally interesting and synthetically useful aziridines. Importantly, the densely functionalized aziridines resulting from this unprecedented tandem reaction offer a platform for expeditious access to architecturally diverse aza&#8208;heterocycles through transformations initiated by selective ring&#8208;opening of aziridines.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Pentafluorosulfanylative Domino Cyclization of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Alkenes to Oxaheterocycles by Using SF6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Become complex! The advanced one&#8208;step photoredox catalytic activation of SF6 allows the preparation of pentaflurosulfanylated oxepans, tetrahydropyrans and tetrahydrofurans as products with high structural complexity.







Abstract
Virtually inert sulfur hexafluoride becomes a precious pentafluorosulfanylation agent, if properly activated by photoredox catalysis, to access &#945;&#8208;fluoro and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy SF5&#8208;compounds. This advanced protocol converts SF6 in the presence of alkynols as bifunctional C&#8722;C&#8208; and C&#8722;O&#8208;bond forming reagents directly into pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step from &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenes. The proposed mechanism is supported by theoretical calculations and gives insights not only in the pentafluorosulfanylation step but also into formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond and is in full agreement with Baldwin's cyclization rules. The key step is a radical type 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; respectively 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;cyclization. The synthesized oxaheterocycles cannot be simply prepared by other synthetic methods, show a high level of structural complexity and significantly expand the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks valuable for medicinal and material chemistry.

         <title>Strong Electronic Communication in Linearly Elongated Rylenes Featuring Tunable Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthetic pathways and purification strategies to access regioisomerically pure isomers of a perylene&#8208;perylene homodimer and a perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 and 35 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs are reported. Furthermore, their optoelectronic properties were tuned via protonation and methylation of their dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit.







Abstract
A modified synthetic pathway towards perylene&#8208;perylene dimers and a facile purification method to obtain the regioisomerically pure syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers are reported. In addition, a novel perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs was designed and synthesized on the basis of a previously described precursor and the resulting regioisomers were separated from each other. Thereby, the opto&#8208;electronic properties of the linearly elongated chromophores could be investigated regarding the differences in length of their aromatic system and the configuration of the isomers. Further tuning of their energy gaps was realized via protonation and methylation of the dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit. Extraordinary red&#8208;shifts of the absorption maxima of 62&#8197;nm for the methylated and 92&#8197;nm for the protonated perylene&#8208;perylene anti&#8208;isomer could be achieved. Moreover, the maxima for the syn&#8208;isomer could be shifted bathochromically by 87 and 113&#8197;nm, respectively.

         <title>Polysaccharide Chemistry in Drug Delivery, Endocrinology, and Vaccines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the importance of using polysaccharide in disease treatment. They are a natural component that can be deployed as drugs and drug enhancers through chemical simple modifications leading to low&#8208;cost natural medicine. Polysaccharide have recently been used for pioneering work in endocrinology, drug delivery, and vaccines.







Abstract
Polysaccharides, due to their outstanding properties, have attracted the attention of researchers, working in the biomedical field and especially of those working in drug delivery. Modified/functionalized polysaccharides further increase the importance for various applications. Delivery of therapeutics for diverse ailments in different endocrine glands and hormones safely, is a focal point of researchers working in the field. Among the routes followed, the transdermal route is preferred due to non&#8208;exposure of active moieties to the harsh gastric environment and first&#8208;pass metabolism. This review starts with the overview of polysaccharides used for the delivery of various therapeutic agents. Advantages of polysaccharides used in the transdermal route are addressed in detail. Types of polysaccharides will be elaborated through examples, and in this context, special emphasis will be on the polysaccharides being used for synthesis of the membranes/films. Techniques employed for their modification to design novel carriers for therapeutics delivery will also be discussed. The review will end with a brief discussion on recent developments and future perspectives for delivery of therapeutic agents, and vaccine development.

         <title>Reductive Rearrangement of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When fed the right food, the hermit crab depicted in the cover image grows bigger and finally needs a larger shell. This work reports the reactivity of a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene, the product of a hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a 2H&#8208;phosphole and an activated imine. Thus, reductive cleavage of the phosphorus&#8722;nitrogen bond with LiAlH4 leads to an unprecedented ring expansion with formation of a 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene. The cover image was designed by Dr. Christoph Selg. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100898).

         <title>Activation of a Copper Biscarbene Mechano&#8208;Catalyst Using Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy Supported by Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point break: A latent copper&#8208;biscarbene mechanocatalyst becomes active when a ligand is forcefully removed. Pulling with around 2&#8197;nN breaks the copper&#8208;carbon bond, as measured by single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy. To be able to assign the bond rupture event to the Cu&#8722;C bond, mechanophores with two different lengths of safety&#8208;line were specifically synthesized for use in this AFM experiment.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy allows investigation of the effect of mechanical force on individual bonds. By determining the forces necessary to sufficiently activate bonds to trigger dissociation, it is possible to predict the behavior of mechanophores. The force necessary to activate a copper biscarbene mechano&#8208;catalyst intended for self&#8208;healing materials was measured. By using a safety line bypassing the mechanophore, it was possible to pinpoint the dissociation of the investigated bond and determine rupture forces to range from 1.6 to 2.6&#8197;nN at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide. The average length&#8208;increase upon rupture of the Cu&#8722;C bond, due to the stretching of the safety line, agrees with quantum chemical calculations, but the values exhibit an unusual scattering. This scattering was assigned to the conformational flexibility of the mechanophore, which includes formation of a threaded structure and recoiling of the safety line.

         <title>Merging N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide into Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Environmentally Benign Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two highly efficient metal&#8722;organic framework catalysts TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NHPI and TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NDHPI have been successfully synthesized through solvothermal reactions of which the frameworks are merged with&#160;N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) units for the first time, resulting in the decoration of pore surfaces with highly active nitroxyl catalytic sites. When&#160;t&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) is used as co&#8208;catalyst, the as synthesized MOFs are demonstrated to be highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for a novel three&#8208;phase heterogeneous oxidation of activated C&#8722;H bond of primary, secondary alcohols and benzyl compounds under mild conditions. Based on the high efficiency and selectivity, an environmental benign system with good sustainability, mild condition, simple work&#8208;up procedure has been established for practical oxidation of a wide range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based &#8220;Turn&#8208;Off&#8221; Probe with Broad Detection Range for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient pyrene&#8208;based probe using fluorescence quenching to detect mercury, lead and copper in organic solvents with high selectivity and specificity was synthetized. The rigid tris&#8208;pyrene chromophore architecture ensures a very broad dynamic range of the sensor's response. Spectroscopic investigation elucidated the stoichiometry and mode of action and revealed a unique aggregation behavior at high analyte concentrations.







Abstract
Detection of metals in different environments with high selectivity and specificity is one of the prerequisites of the fight against environmental pollution with these elements. Pyrenes are well suited for the fluorescence sensing in different media. The applied sensing principle typically relies on the formation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular excimers, which is however limiting the sensitivity range due to masking of e.&#8201;g. quenching effects by the excimer emission. Herein we report a highly selective, structurally rigid chemical sensor based on the monomer fluorescence of pyrene moieties bearing triazole groups. This sensor can quantitatively detect Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ in organic solvents over a broad concentrations range, even in the presence of ubiquitous ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The strongly emissive sensor's fluorescence with a long lifetime of 165&#8197;ns is quenched by a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex formation upon addition of metal ions in acetonitrile. Upon addition of a tenfold excess of the metal ion to the sensor, agglomerates with a diameter of about 3&#8197;nm are formed. Due to complex interactions in the system, conventional linear correlations are not observed for all concentrations. Therefore, a critical comparison between the conventional Job plot interpretation, the method of Benesi&#8208;Hildebrand, and a non&#8208;linear fit is presented. The reported system enables the specific and robust sensing of medically and environmentally relevant ions in the health&#8208;relevant nM range and could be used e.&#8201;g. for the monitoring of the respective ions in waste streams.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal free route to phosphetes featuring an exocyclic alkene unit is presented. In this approach phosphanides are added to a variety of diynes generating phosphaallylic intermediates which depending on the reaction conditions transform either to phosphetes or the corresponding phospholes. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combined quantum chemical and experimental means identifies phosphole formation as thermodynamically controlled reaction path, whereas kinetic control furnishes the corresponding phosphetes. Structural and luminescence properties of the rare class of phosphetes are explored, as well as for selected key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Study of ground state interactions of enantiopure chiral quaternary ammonium salts and amides, nitroalkanes, nitroalkenes, esters, heterocycles, ketones and fluoroamides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis provides high level of enantiocontrol, however no experimental data showed the interaction of catalysts and substrates. We have carried out 1H&#8208;NMR titration of Cinchona and Maruoka ammonium bromides vs nitro, carbonyl, heterocycles, and N&#8208;F containing compounds. We found that neutral organic species and quaternary ammonium salts interacted via an ensemble of catalyst +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H, specific for each substrate studied. The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls via a diverse set of +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, via specific C&#8208;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36&#8201;% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics.







Abstract
A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are obtained by a one&#8208;pot approach in the presence of a template reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only subclass to form with steric hindrance. The structural analyses carried out on compounds 1 and 14 revealed distinct conformational differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH&#8230;Cl hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen bridge strongly favors one of the two possible atropisomers. Hindered rotation of the meso&#8208;aryl groups is observed only in the cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives 10 and 15 and leads to the observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923&#8197;nm are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e&#8722; and 2e&#8722; reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc phlorinate.

         <title>Solvent Induced Helix Folding of Defined Indolenine Squaraine Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defined indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer were synthesised via iterative cross coupling. Depending on the solvent either a random coil (J&#8208;type) or a loose helix (H&#8208;type) is formed. Structural and folding properties were examined via optical spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, SANS and computations.







Abstract
A protecting group strategy was employed to synthesise a series of indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer. The longer oligomers show a distinct solvent dependence of the absorption spectra, that is, either a strong blue shift or a strong red shift of the lowest energy bands in the near infrared spectral region. This behaviour is explained by exciton coupling theory as being due to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling of transition moments. The H&#8208;type coupling is a consequence of a helix folding in solvents with a small Hansen dispersity index. DOSY NMR, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), quantum chemical and force field calculations agree upon a helix structure with an unusually large pitch and open voids that are filled with solvent molecules, thereby forming a kind of clathrate. The thermodynamic parameters of the folding process were determined by temperature dependent optical absorption spectra.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Large Single Crystals of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni Prepared by a Modulation Approach: In situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel mixed linker modulation approach yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni, an analogue that has not yet been able to be studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction due to crystal size limitations. This study investigates the nitric oxide, an important therapeutic agent, gas loading behavior of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni single crystals utilizing an in&#8197;situ gas cell setup using synchrotron radiation.







Abstract
The size of single crystals of the metal&#8208;organic framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni was incrementally increased through a series of modulated syntheses. A novel linker modulated synthesis using 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid and the isomeric ligand 4,6&#8208;dihydroxyisophthalic acid yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni (&#8764;70&#8197;&#956;m). All materials were shown to have high crystallinity and phase purity through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy methods, thermogravimetry, and compositional analysis. For the first time single&#8208;crystal structure analyses were carried out on CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni. High BET surface areas and nitric oxide (NO) release efficiencies were recorded for all materials. Large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni showed a prolonged NO release and proved suitable for in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal diffraction experiments to follow the NO adsorption. An efficient activation protocol was developed, leading to a dehydrated structure after just 4&#8197;h, which subsequently was NO&#8208;loaded, leading to a first NO loaded single&#8208;crystal structural model of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of 2&#8208;Pyridones with Alkynes: Switchable Alkenylation, Alkenylation/Directing Group Migration and Rollover Annulation</title>

Under control: From a single starting material, three different products can be prepared with excellent chemoselectivity in the presence of a rhodium precatalyst. Conditions for the synthesis of vinylated pyridones, tetrasubstituted alkenes, and annulated pyridone derivatives are advanced using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones. Through careful choice of co&#8208;catalysts and additives, the reaction paths can be successfully manipulated to provide products that are difficult to access by other methods. Experimental and DFT studies provide insight into the diverse reaction pathways.







Abstract
Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones with internal alkynes that can be controlled to give three different products in good yields has been realized. Depending on the reaction conditions, solvents and additives, the reaction pathway can be switched between alkenylation, alkenylation/directing group migration and rollover annulation. These reaction manifolds allow divergent access to a variety of valuable C6&#8208;alkenylated 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones, (Z)&#8208;6&#8208;(1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)vinyl)pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and 10H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridin&#8208;10&#8208;ones from the same starting materials. These protocols exhibit excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good tolerance of functional groups. A combination of experimental and computational approaches have been employed to uncover the key mechanistic features of these reactions.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Iron Catalyst for Highly Enantioselective and Diastereoselective Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complex, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality is exclusively due to a stereogenic iron center, catalyzes hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Key for this excellent stereocontrol are bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands which increase the steric hindrance at the catalytic site.







Abstract
This study demonstrates that chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality the consequence of a stereogenic iron center, are capable of catalyzing asymmetric transformations with very high enantioselectivities. The catalyst is based on a previously reported design (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 4322), in which iron(II) is surrounded by two configurationally inert achiral bidentate N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes in a C2&#8208;symmetric fashion and complemented by two labile acetonitriles. By replacing mesityl with more bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the NHC ligands, the steric hindrance at the catalytic site was increased, thereby providing a markedly improved asymmetric induction. The new chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron catalyst was applied to the inverse electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoester and enol ethers provide 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Other electron rich dienophiles are also suitable as demonstrated for a reaction with a vinyl azide.

         <title>Click Chemistry in Ultra&#8208;high Vacuum &#8211; Tetrazine Coupling with Methyl Enol Ether Covalently Linked to Si(001)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free coupling of a tetrazine derivative and an enol ether group, the latter being covalently attached on a Si(001) surface via cyclooctyne, has been observed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. DFT calculations identified the associated reaction meachanism. This click chemistry scheme allows the synthesis of covalently bound molecular architectures on highly reactive surfaces in a UHV environment.







Abstract
The additive&#8208;free tetrazine/enol ether click reaction was performed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) with an enol ether group covalently linked to a silicon surface: Dimethyl 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate molecules were coupled to the enol ether group of a functionalized cyclooctyne which was adsorbed on the silicon (001) surface via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. The reaction was observed at a substrate temperature of 380&#8197;K by means of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A moderate energy barrier was deduced for this click reaction in vacuum by means of density functional theory based calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results. This UHV&#8208;compatible click reaction thus opens a new, flexible route for synthesizing covalently bound organic architectures.

         <title>Binding of a TlCl Entity by a Tetragold Tetramercaptothiacalixarene Metalloligand via Metallophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene was used as a coordination platform to synthesize and investigate gold(I) complexes with varying nuclearity. Aiming at the corresponding tetranuclear complex through salt metathesis it was found capable of binding a neutral, molecular TlCl entity by metallophilic interactions, as shown by structural and theoretical investigations. These Interactions lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures (see figure).







Abstract
The successive auration of p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene, H4(MTC[4]), with gold(I) phosphine units was investigated. Through deprotonation with NaOMe, followed by salt metathesis reactions with (PR3)AuCl (R=Me, Ph) complexes with two and three [(PR3)Au]+ moieties could be prepared and isolated, namely [(Ph3PAu)2H2(MTC[4])] and [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])]. In [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])] two gold atoms already come close enough to undergo aurophilic interactions. To introduce a fourth [(PR3)Au]+ entity TlOEt had to be used for the deprotonation, which led to the finding that four gold atoms organised by the (MTC[4])4&#8722; coordination platform are able to bind and stabilize a TlCl entity, yielding [(Me3PAu)4TlCl(MTC[4])]. As evidenced by structural and theoretical investigations the binding occurs through strong metallophilic interactions, which lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures.

         <title>Oligomers Intermediates in Between Two New Distinct Homonuclear Uranium(IV) DOTP Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between tetravalent uranium and DOTP, a cyclen&#8208;derived tetraphosphonic ligand, was studied in aqueous solutions. It resulted in the eventual formation of two new different homo&#8208;nuclear species, [UIV(DOTPH4)] and [UIV(DOTPH6)2]. Various analytical techniques showed that a pH&#8208;dependent, reversible and irreversible oligomerization processes govern both species in&#8208;solution dynamics.







Abstract
Two new aqueous UIV complexes were synthesized by the interaction between the tetravalent uranium cation and the (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (DOTP) macrocyclic ligand. Two distinct homonuclear complexes were identified; the first was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;cage&#8221;, [U(DOTPH6)2] complex, in which the UIV cation is octa&#8208;coordinated to 4 phosphonic arms from each ligand in a square anti&#8208;prism geometry, with a C4 symmetry. The second is the &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; [U(DOTPH4)] complex, in which the tetravalent cation is located between the macrocycle O4 and N4 planes. With the help of UV&#8208;Vis absorption, 1H/31P&#8197;NMR, ATR&#8208;IR, and MALDI&#8208;TOFMS analytical techniques, the chemical interchange between both species is presented. It is shown that the one&#8208;way transition is governed by the formation of a multiple number of soluble oligomeric species consisting of varied stoichiometric ratios of both characterized homonuclear complexes.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Scaffolded Disulfide Redox Network for Programming Drug&#8208;Delivery Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening the therapeutic window wider: An in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) can be used as a smart drug&#8208;delivery system. Drug release can be controlled and drug&#8208;delivery kinetics programmed by using DNA scaffolds for precise control over the position and number of disulfide bonds. As a therapeutic platform, this DdiSRN shows greatly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in cancer therapy.







Abstract
In response to specific stimuli, dynamic covalent materials enable the generation of new structures by reversibly forming/breaking chemical bonds, thus showing great potential for application in controlled drug release. However, using dynamic covalent chemistry to program drug&#8208;delivery kinetics remains challenging. Herein, an in&#8197;situ polymerization&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) is reported in which nucleic acids are used as a scaffold for dynamic disulfide bonds. The constructed DdiSRN allows selective release of loading cargos inside cancer cells in response to redox stimuli. Moreover, the density of disulfide bonds in network can be tuned by precise control over their position and number on DNA scaffolds. As a result, drug&#8208;delivery kinetics can be programmed with a half&#8208;life, t1/2, decreasing from 8.3 to 4.4&#8197;h, thus facilitating keeping an adequate drug concentration within the therapeutic window. Both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies confirm that co&#8208;delivery of DOX and siRNA in combination with fast drug release inside cells using this DdiSRN enhances the therapeutic effect on multidrug&#8208;resistant cancer. This nontrivial therapeutic platform enabling kinetic control provides a good paradigm for precision cancer medicine.

         <title>Nickel/Cobalt Molybdate Hollow Rods Induced by Structure and Defect Engineering as Exceptional Electrode Materials for Hybrid Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects are engineered and prepared through a facile soft&#8208;template combined with partial reduction methods. The electrode material shows exceptional specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention of the D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 is about 95.8&#8201;% along with the cycle number of 3000. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4//AC exhibits an exceptional energy density (34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface&#8208;controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects (D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4) through a soft&#8208;template and partial reduction method, enhancing D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4&#8217;s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000&#8197;cycles. D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects as pseudocapacitor material for high&#8208;performance capacitive energy storage devices.

         <title>DNA Functionality with Photoswitchable Hydrazone Cytidine**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;modified cytidine phosphoramidite and oligodeoxynucleotides containing this modification is presented. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of a 450&#8197;nm blue light was investigated in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The control of DNA synthesis in&#8197;vitro was achieved by using the blue light in the primer extension reactions in the presence of DNA polymerases.







Abstract
A new family of hydrazone modified cytidine phosphoramidite building block was synthesized and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides to construct photoswitchable DNA strands. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of blue light with a wavelength of 450&#8197;nm was investigated and confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The light activated Z form isomer of this hydrazone&#8208;cytidine with a six&#8208;member intramolecular hydrogen bond was found to inhibit DNA synthesis in the primer extension model by using Bst DNA polymerase. In addition, the hydrazone modification caused the misincorporation of dATP together with dGTP into the growing DNA strand with similar selectivity, highlighting a potential G to A mutation. This work provides a novel functional DNA building block and an additional molecular tool that has potential chemical biology and biomedicinal applications to control DNA synthesis and DNA&#8208;enzyme interactions using the cell friendly blue light irradiation.

Synthetic efforts to bend aromatic surfaces have had a remarkable evolution during the last dozen years. Conjugated nanorings and nanobelts are among the most well&#8208;known examples. However, this progress has also led to the synthesis of molecular compounds with permanent tubular shapes with radial and axial &#960; surfaces, which are the highlight of this Minireview.







Abstract
Molecular compounds with permanent tubular architectures displaying radial &#960;&#8208;conjugation are exceedingly rare. Their radial and axial delocalization presents them with unique optical and electronic properties, such as remarkable tuning of their Stokes shifts, and redox switching between global and local aromaticity. Although these tubular compounds display large internal void spaces, these attributes have not been extensively explored, thus presenting future opportunities in the development of materials. By using cutting&#8208;edge synthetic methodologies to bend aromatic surfaces, large opportunities in synthesis, property discovery, and applications are expected in new members of this family of conjugated molecular nanotubes.

         <title>&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Trapping of Multiple Transient Azolyllithiums in Batch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments in flow microreactor technology have allowed the use of transient organolithium compounds that cannot be realized in a batch reactor. However, trapping of the transient heteroaryllithiums in &#8220;halogen dance&#8221; is still challenging. We report trapping of such short&#8208;lived azolyllithiums in a batch reactor by developing a finely tuned in situ zincation using zinc halide diamine complexes, whose reaction rate is controlled by the appropriate choice of the diamine ligand. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0 &#176;C with high reproducibility on a multi&#8208;gram scale. This method was applicable to a wide range of brominated azoles allowing for deprotonative functionalization, which was used for the concise divergent syntheses of both constitutional isomers of biologically active azoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Amphiphilic Porphyrins to Construct Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic photosensitizers greatly affect the cell permeability and enrichment in tumours. They cannot be used directly for clinical applications because they always reunite in water, preventing their circulation in the blood and accumulation in tumour cells. As a result, amphiphilic photosensitizers are highly desirable. Although nanomaterial&#8208;based photosensitizers can solve water solubility, they have disadvantages of complicated operation, poor reproducibility, low drug loading, and poor stability. In this work, we propose an efficient synthesis strategy that converts small molecules into nanoparticles in 100% aqueous solution via the molecular assemble without addition of any foreign species. Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and different lengths of ethylene glycol chains are synthesized as TPP&#8208;PPh  3  , TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;2PEG and TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;4PEG to improve amphiphilicity. Among of three photosensitizers, TPP&#8208;PPh3&#8208;4PEG is the most efficient (singlet oxygen yield: 0.89) for tumour photodynamic therapy not only because of its definite constituent, but also because its amphiphilic structure allows it to self&#8208;assemble in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and molecular docking study of the interaction between neutral Re(I) tetrazolate complexes and bovine serum albumin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Re(I) complexes have potential in biomedical sciences as imaging agents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Re(I) complexes interact with carrier proteins, like serum albumins. Here, we used two neutral Re(I) complexes (  fac  &#8208;[Re(CO)  3  (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)L], where L is either 4&#8208;cyanophenyltetrazolate  (1)  or 4&#8208;methoxycarbonylphenyltetrazole ester  (2)  , to study the interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spectroscopic measurements, calculations of thermodynamic and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer parameters, as well as molecular modelling were performed to study differential binding between BSA and complex  1  and  2  . Induced&#8208;fit docking combined with quantum&#8208;polarised ligand docking were employed in what is believed to be a first for a Re(I) complex as a ligand for BSA. Our findings provide a basis for other molecular interaction studies and suggest that subtle functional group alterations at the terminal region of the Re(I) complex have a significant impact on the ability of this class of compounds to interact with BSA; which is important for the functional design of Re(I) complexes in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Enolates: Versatile Intermediates for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Functionalization via Noncovalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Uranyl Organic Frameworks Supported by Rigid Octadentate Carboxylate Ligand: Synthesis, Structure Diversity, and Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven 3D uranyl organic frameworks have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate linker. These UOFs have diverse 3D self&#8208;assembled architectures as a function of pH, co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals.







Abstract
Seven three dimensional (3D) uranyl organic frameworks (UOFs), formulated as [NH4][(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)] (1), [(UO2)4(HTTDS)2](HIM)6 (2, IM=imidazole), [(UO2)4(TTDS)(H2O)2(Phen)2] (3, Phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), [Zn(H2O)4]0.5[(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)4] (4), and {(UO2)2[Zn(H2O)3]2(TTDS)} (5), {Zn(UO2)2(H2O)(Dib)0.5(HDib)(HTTDS)} (6, Dib=1,4&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) and [Na]{(UO2)4[Cu3(u3&#8208;OH)(H2O)7](TTDS)2} (7) have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate ligand, tetrakis(3,5&#8208;dicarboxyphenyl)silicon(H8TTDS). These UOFs have different 3D self&#8208;assembled structures as a function of co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals. The structure of 1 has an infinite ribbon formed by the UO7 pentagonal bipyramid bridged by carboxylate groups. With further introduction of auxiliary N&#8208;donor ligands, different structure of 2 and 3 are formed, in 2 the imidazole serves as space filler, while in 3 the Phen are bound to [UO2]2+ units as co&#8208;ligands. The second metal centers were introduced in the syntheses of 4&#8211;7, and in all cases, they are part of the final structures, either as a counterion (4) or as a component of framework (5&#8722;7). Interesting, in 7, a rare polyoxometalate [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)O7(O2CR)4] cluster was found in the structure. It acts as an inorganic building unit together with the dimer [(UO2)2(O2CR)4] unit. Those uranyl carboxylates were sufficiently determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their topological structures and luminescence properties were analyzed in detail.

With further introduction of auxiliary N&#8208;donor ligands, different structure of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are formed, in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; the imidazole serves as space filler, while in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; the Phen are bound to [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; units as co&#8208;ligands. The second metal centers were introduced in the syntheses of &lt;b&gt;4&#8211;7&lt;/b&gt;, and in all cases, they are part of the final structures, either as a counterion (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) or as a component of framework (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;). Interesting, in &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, a rare polyoxometalate [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;OH)O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster was found in the structure. It acts as an inorganic building unit together with the dimer [(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] unit. Those uranyl carboxylates were sufficiently determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their topological structures and luminescence properties were analyzed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isolation of an Antiaromatic 9&#8208;Hydroxy Fluorenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly stable after all: Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenylacylium ion by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride, gave rise to a 4&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed via an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.







Abstract
Fluorenyl cations are textbook examples of 4&#960; electron antiaromatic five&#8208;membered ring systems. So far, they were reported only as short&#8208;lived intermediates generated under superacidic conditions or by flash photolysis. Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenyl acylium cation by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride gave rise to an isolable 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed by an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrosilylation of Ketenes with Silicon Electrophiles: Access to Fully Substituted Aldehyde&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted silyl enol ethers derived from aldehydes are difficult to prepare. This rare class of compounds has been made accessible by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free hydrosilylation of ketenes with B(C6F5)3 as catalyst and Et3SiH as stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope is decent, and the stereoselectivity moderate to good in selected cases.







Abstract
Little&#8208;explored hydrosilylation of ketenes promoted by main&#8208;group catalysts is reported. The boron Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane accelerates the slow uncatalyzed reaction of ketenes and hydrosilanes, thereby providing a convenient access to the new class of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted aldehyde&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers. Yields are moderate to high, and Z configuration is preferred. The corresponding silyl bis&#8208;enol ethers are also available when using dihydrosilanes. The related trityl&#8208;cation&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation involving self&#8208;regeneration of silylium ions is far less effective.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Aryl Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop=neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. Elucidation of key mechanistic features of this newly developed reaction led to the identification of fully characterized nickel intermediates.







Abstract
A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop=neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. The regioselective borylation of unsymmetric diaryl sulfoxides was also feasible leading to borylation of the sterically less encumbered aryl substituent. Competition experiments demonstrated that an electron&#8208;deficient aryl moiety reacts preferentially. The origin of the selectivity in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of electronically biased unsymmetrical diaryl sulfoxide lies in the oxidative addition step of the catalytic cycle, as oxidative addition of methoxyphenyl 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl sulfoxide to the Ni(0) complex occurs selectively to give the structurally characterized complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4){(SO)&#8208;4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4}] 4. For complex 5, the isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I was structurally characterized in which the phenyl sulfinyl ligand is bound via the oxygen atom to nickel. In solution, the complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I is in equilibrium with the S&#8208;bonded isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(SOC6H5)] 5, as shown by NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal that these isomers are separated by a mere 0.3&#8197;kJ/mol (M06/def2&#8208;TZVP&#8208;level of theory) and connected via a transition state trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(&#951;2&#8208;{SO}&#8208;C6H5)], which lies only 10.8&#8197;kcal/mol above 5.

         <title>Molecular Tools for the Study of ADP&#8208;Ribosylation: A Unified and Versatile Method to Synthesise Native Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylated Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides: A universal approach to synthesise mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is presented. These peptides can provide a valuable tool for studying ADP&#8208;ribosylation. This is demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides modified on Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; or Cys&#8208;residues, the latter of which can act as a stable isostere for Ser&#8208;ADPr as Cys&#8208;ADPr is not reversed by the Ser&#8208;ADPr hydrolase ARH3. Furthermore, in using these peptides, the first hydrolase capable of hydrolysing Cys&#8208;ADPr was identified.







Abstract
ADP&#8208;ribosylation (ADPr), as a post&#8208;translational modification, plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;repair, immunity and many other cellular and physiological processes. Serine is the main acceptor for ADPr in DNA damage response, whereas the physiological impact of less common ADPr&#8208;modifications of cysteine and threonine side chains is less clear. Generally, gaining molecular insights into ADPr recognition and turn&#8208;over is hampered by the availability of homogeneous, ADP&#8208;ribosylated material, such as mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated (MARylated) peptides. Here, a new and efficient solid&#8208;phase strategy for the synthesis of Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; and Cys&#8208;MARylated peptides is described. ADP&#8208;ribosylated cysteine, apart from being a native post&#8208;translational modification in its own right, proved to be suitable as a stabile bioisostere for ADP&#8208;ribosylated serine making it a useful tool to further biochemical research on serine ADP&#8208;ribosylation. In addition, it was discovered that the Streptococcus pyogenes encoded protein, SpyMacroD, acts as a Cys&#8208;(ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase.

Furthermore, in using these peptides, the first hydrolase capable of hydrolysing Cys&#8208;ADPr was identified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADP&#8208;ribosylation (ADPr), as a post&#8208;translational modification, plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;repair, immunity and many other cellular and physiological processes. Serine is the main acceptor for ADPr in DNA damage response, whereas the physiological impact of less common ADPr&#8208;modifications of cysteine and threonine side chains is less clear. Generally, gaining molecular insights into ADPr recognition and turn&#8208;over is hampered by the availability of homogeneous, ADP&#8208;ribosylated material, such as mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated (MARylated) peptides. Here, a new and efficient solid&#8208;phase strategy for the synthesis of Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; and Cys&#8208;MARylated peptides is described. ADP&#8208;ribosylated cysteine, apart from being a native post&#8208;translational modification in its own right, proved to be suitable as a stabile bioisostere for ADP&#8208;ribosylated serine making it a useful tool to further biochemical research on serine ADP&#8208;ribosylation. In addition, it was discovered that the &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; encoded protein, &lt;i&gt;Spy&lt;/i&gt;MacroD, acts as a Cys&#8208;(ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach to Multilayer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings in the presence of new chiral amide&#8208;phosphines is reported. The resulting multilayer products showed strong luminescence under UV irradiation, and displayed strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality has been achieved by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. New chiral catalysts were designed and screened under various catalytic systems that proved chiral amide&#8208;phosphines to be more efficient ligands than other candidates. The multilayer 3D framework was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray structural analysis showing a parallel pattern of three layers consisting of top, middle and bottom aromatic rings. The X&#8208;ray structure of a catalyst complex, dichloride complex of Pd&#8208;phosphine amide, was obtained revealing an interesting asymmetric environment nearby the Pd metal center. Three rings of multilayer 3D products can be readily changed by varying aromatic ring&#8208;anchored starting materials. The resulting multilayer products displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). In the future, this work would benefit not only the field of asymmetric synthesis but also materials science, in particular polarized organic electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of the Degradation of Fluoroethylene Carbonate, an Additive of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries, Unraveled by Radiation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forming an attachment: In neat fluoroethylene carbonate, an additive commonly used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, excess electrons formed upon radiolysis primarly undergo attachment rather than solvation. The formation of the cyclic radical anion is not observed when fluoroethylene carbonate is a solute in other solvents.







Abstract
Numerous additives are used in the electrolytes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially for the formation of an efficient solid electrolyte interphase at the surface of the electrodes. Understanding the degradation processes of these compounds is thus important; they can be seen through radiolysis. In the case of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), picosecond pulse radiolysis experiments evidenced the formation of FEC.&#8722;. This radical is stabilized in neat FEC, whereas the ring opens to form more stable radical anions when FEC is a solute in other solvents, as confirmed by quantum chemistry calculations. In neat FEC, pre&#8208;solvated electrons primarily undergo attachment rather than solvation. On long timescales, the gases produced (H2, CO, and CO2) were quantified. A reaction scheme for both the oxidizing and reducing pathways at stake in irradiated FEC is proposed. This work shows that the nature of the primary species formed in FEC depends on the amount of FEC in the solution.

         <title>Reversible Vapochromic Luminescence Accompanied by Planar&#8211;Half&#8208;Chair Conformational Change of a Propeller&#8208;Shaped Boron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leakage of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is one of the most severe industrial accidents because it can cause environmental pollution, global warming, fire, and explosion. Hence the visualization of leakage is an essential technology to detect it at an early stage. Molecular crystals whose fluorescence color can be changed by the exposure to VOCs could potentially serve as the sensing materials for realizing rapid and facile VOC detection. These materials, however, usually require harsh conditions, such as heating or a vacuum, to recover their initial phases for reuse. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain completely reversible sensing systems without such energy&#8208;consuming recycling processes. Here we report the reversible color change of fluorescence from the crystals of a propeller&#8208;shaped boron  &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex. The complex was crystallized in distinct crystalline phases having different luminescent colors. Importantly, these phases were interconverted repeatedly upon exposure to the vapors of the appropriate VOCs. The small energy differences between conformers of the complex could lead to this pseudopolymorphic behavior. This finding could be applied for the development of further eco&#8208;friendly reversible sensing materials based on four&#8208;coordinated boron complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials (Zr&#8208;MOFs) have more practical usage over most conventional benchmark materials and even many other MOFs due to excellent structural stability, rich coordination forms, and various active sites. However, their mass&#8208;production and application are restricted by the high&#8208;cost raw materials, complex synthesis procedures, harsh reaction conditions, and unexpected environmental impact. Based on the principles of &#8220;Green Chemistry&#8221;, considerable efforts have been devoted to breaking through the limitations, and significant progress has been made in the sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs over the past decade. In this review, the advancements of green raw materials and green synthesis methods in the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs are reviewed, along with the corresponding drawbacks. The challenges and prospects are discussed and outlooked, expecting to provide a guidance for the acceleration of the industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8208;based MOF.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Topological Landscape by a G&#8208;Column Flip of a Parallel G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Canonical G&#8208;quadruplexes can adopt a variety of different topologies depending on the arrangement of propeller, lateral, or diagonal loops connecting the four G&#8208;columns. A novel intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex structure is derived through inversion of the last G&#8208;tract of a three&#8208;layered parallel fold, associated with the transition of a single propeller into a lateral loop.

         <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;Dimethylallene with N&#8208;Methylaniline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of the intermolecular hydroamination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;butadiene (  1  ) with  N  &#8208;methylaniline (  2  ) catalyzed by (IPr)AuOTf has been studied employing a combination of kinetic analysis, deuterium labelling studies, and  in situ  spectral analysis of catalytically active mixtures. The results of these and additional experiments are consistent with a mechanism for hydroamination involving reversible, endergonic displacement of  N  &#8208;methylaniline from [(IPr)Au(NHMePh)]  +  (  4  ) by allene to form the cationic gold &#960;&#8208;  C1,C2  &#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;  2  &#8208;H  2  C=C=CMe  2  )]  +  (  I  ) which is in rapid, endergonic equilibrium with the regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;  C2,C3  &#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;  2  &#8208;Me  2  C=C=CH  2  )]  +  (  I'  ). Rapid and reversible outer&#8208;sphere addition of  2  to the terminal allene carbon atom of  I'  to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CH  2  )CMe  2  NMePh] (  II  ) is superimposed on slower addition of  2  to terminal allene carbon atom of  I  to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CMe  2  )CH  2  NMePh] (  III  ).

         <title>Artificial supramolecular pumps powered by light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial nanoscale motors that can use energy from a source to perform tasks requires systems capable of performing directionally controlled molecular movements and operating away from chemical equilibrium. Here we describe the design, synthesis and properties of pseudorotaxanes in which a photon input triggers the unidirectional motion of a macrocyclic ring with respect to a non&#8208;symmetric molecular axle. The photoinduced energy ratcheting at the basis of the pumping mechanism is validated by measuring the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Owing to the photochemical behaviour of the azobenzene moiety embedded in the axle, the pump can repeat its operation cycle autonomously under continuous illumination. We use NMR spectroscopy to observe the dissipative non&#8208;equilibrium state generated  in situ  by light irradiation. We also show that fine changes in the axle structure lead to an improvement in the performance of the motor. Such results highlight the modularity and versatility of this minimalist pump design, which provides facile access to dynamic systems that operate under photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium regimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Propensity of different Fluorine Atom Types: An Analysis of Experimentally&#8208; and Computationally&#8208;derived Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The propensity of organic fluorine acting as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies often reaching different conclusions. Over the last few years new and stronger evidences have emerged for the direct involvement of fluorine in weak hydrogen bond (HB) formation. However, not all the fluorine atom types can act as weak HBA. In this work we have analyzed the differential HBA propensity of various types of fluorine atoms with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. This is carried out by evaluating  ab initio  computed parameters, experimental  19  F NMR chemical shifts and small molecule crystallographic structures (extracted from the CSD database). According to this analysis, shielded (with reference to the  19  F NMR chemical shift) mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl motifs display the highest HBA propensity in agreement with solution studies. Although much weaker than other well characterized HB complexes, the fragile HBs formed by these fluorinated motifs have important implications for the chemical&#8208;physical and structural properties of the molecules, chemical reactions and protein/ligand recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208; and Fluorene&#8208;fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs: NIR Fluorophores with High Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes incorporating fused fluorene or carbazole moieties were prepared. The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (  TPAB  ): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700 cm  &#8208;1  ) and emission maximum (up to 2270 cm  &#8208;1  ); almost 3&#8208;fold increase of molar absorption coefficients (to around 230,000 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) and significant increase of the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8208;66%. Owing to the combination of these properties the new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit is also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100 nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on  TPAB  chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and an&#160;in situ&#160;irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allows for an efficient access to a variety of  N  &#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8208;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In the present article, we report our complete experimental and computational investigations on the mechanism of such a transformation. Support for a dual gold catalysis has been found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in 3 stages: 1) formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2) cyclization to produce a  gem  &#8208;diaurated aryl complex, and 3) catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes using B  2  Pin  2  &#160;as the boron source.&#160; This unprecedented reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. This transformation relied on the the possible electrochemical oxidation of an&#160;  in situ  &#160;formed borate. This anodic oxidation performed in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a putative boryl radical, which reacted on the alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Disaccharides in Water: Preorganized Macrocyclic or Adaptive Acyclic?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When facing the dilemma of following a preorganized or adaptive design approach in conceiving the architecture of new biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic structures were most often chosen to achieve effective recognition of neutral saccharides in water. In contrast, acyclic architectures have been seldom explored, even though potentially simpler and more easily accessible. In this work, comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related diaminocarbazolic receptors, featuring a macrocyclic and an acyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped architecture, highlighted the advantages provided by the acyclic receptor in terms of selectivity in the recognition of 1,4&#8208;disaccharides of biological interest. Selective recognition of GlcNAc  2  , the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, stands as an emblematic example. NMR spectroscopic data and molecular modeling calculations were used to ascertain the differences in binding mode and to shed light on the origin of recognition efficacy and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Owing to their highly designable and tunable features, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively investigated and developed in a wide range of applications. However, due to their crystalline nature, poor manipulation and processability restrict their practical implementation. In this context, the development of membranous MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid materials is an effective approach to address these shortcomings. This minireview provides a systematic overview on the construction of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and emphasizes their functions, including separation, ion conduction, and sensing, and points out a perspective on their future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8208;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behavior between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2, 3) (Cp = 1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L = 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy,  1[PF6]n), 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5'&#8208;dmbpy,  2[PF6]n) and 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4'&#8208;dmbpy,  3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized.&#160;The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru center from H, 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order:  13+  &lt;  23+  &lt;  33+  , and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order  14+  &gt;  34+  &gt;  24+  . The &#160;potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centers for  N[PF6]2  are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centers would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF  4  ] involving heteroanionic units. Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs  3  (B  3  O  3  F  6  )&#183;Cs(BF  4  ). The influence of [BF  4  ] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF  4  ] units.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;  &#160;  = 100%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, we developed various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80%. Furthermore, we studied the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30%.</dc:description>

The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired and Eco&#8208;friendly Synthesis of 3D Spongy Meso&#8208;Microporous Carbons from CO2 for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO  2  in molten carbonate Li  2  CO  3  &#8208;Na  2  CO  3  &#8208;K  2  CO  3  at 580&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO  2  at 4 A for 0.5 h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  , excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9 % of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for  L  &#8208;cysteine (  L  &#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co  3  O  4  composite (NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  ) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co  3  O  4  , NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co  3  O  4  and multi&#8208;electron NiMo  6  clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo  6  , and the optimized NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive  L  &#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023 &#956;M  &#8208;1  and the detection limit at least 0.018 &#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8722;20 &#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Nanosheets Stacked Hierarchical &#8220;Honey Stick&#8208;like&#8221; MFI Zeolite by Aromatic Heterocyclic Dual&#8208;functional Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft template designing is the most promised strategy for synthesis of zeolites nanosheets. So far, MFI nanosheets directed by soft templates (containing long chain alkyl groups or aromatic groups as hydrophobic component), can be found frequently. However, the MFI nanosheets synthesized by soft template with aromatic heterocycle groups (e.g. s&#8208;triazine groups) are rare. Herein, nanosheets stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized utilizing a triply branched s&#8208;triazine based surfactant as a bifunctional organic structure&#8208;directing agent. On the basis of geometrical match relationship, a formation model has been proposed. Synthesized NSHM was endowed with abundant mesopores stacked by nanosheets and exhibited a high surface area (430 m  2  &#8236;&#183;g  &#8208;1  ). The 1 wt% Pd/NSHM attained a significant increase in cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture yield (from 66% to 85%) in oxidation of cyclohexane compared with Silicalite&#8208;1 and SBA&#8208;15 as supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Bright GFP&#8208;Like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Here, we report a novel fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of ~100,000 M  &#8722;1  &#183;cm  &#8722;1  . Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8208;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>Consequences of amide connectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrins: spectroscopic observations rationalized by theoretical modelling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between molecular structure and mechanism of supramolecular polymerizations is a topic of great interest, with a special focus on the pathway complexity of porphyrin assemblies. Their cooperative polymerization typically yields highly ordered, long 1D polymers and is driven by a combination of &#960;&#8208;stacking due to solvophobic effects and hydrogen bonding interactions. Subtle changes in molecular structure, however, have significant influence on the cooperativity factor and yield different aggregate types (J&#8208; versus H&#8208;aggregates) of different lengths. In this study we investigate the influence of amide connectivity on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of porphyrin based supramolecular monomers. While in apolar solvents C=O centered monomers readily assemble into helical supramolecular polymers via a cooperative mechanism, their NH centered counterparts form short, non&#8208;helical J&#8208;type aggregates via an isodesmic pathway. With a combination of spectroscopy and density functional theory modelling, we shed light on the molecular origins causing this stunning difference in assembly properties and demonstrate the importance of molecular connectivity in the design of supramolecular systems. Finally, we present their mutual interference in copolymerization experiments.</dc:description>

While in apolar solvents C=O centered monomers readily assemble into helical supramolecular polymers via a cooperative mechanism, their NH centered counterparts form short, non&#8208;helical J&#8208;type aggregates via an isodesmic pathway. With a combination of spectroscopy and density functional theory modelling, we shed light on the molecular origins causing this stunning difference in assembly properties and demonstrate the importance of molecular connectivity in the design of supramolecular systems. Finally, we present their mutual interference in copolymerization experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert &#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert &#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides via Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides via sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols was introduced. The highly economic, insensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;  absorbance average  s  ulfur  a  mount in  p  olysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative  13  C NMR. Also, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and unsymmetrical polysulfides was obtained.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of two diazabisacenes is reported. A bisboronated naphthalene is Suzuki&#8208;coupled to substituted ethyl nicotinates, then cyclized  via  intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved using amines, difluorocarbene (generated  in situ  ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO  2  . Various  tert  &#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification using column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained via computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0 &#176;C without any additives was discovered. Furthermore, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.</dc:description>
