         <title>The Electrochemical cis&#8208;Chlorination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double role: The cis&#8208;chlorination of alkenes is realised in an electrochemical setup with PhSeCl as catalyst. The supporting electrolyte (TBACl) acts as nucleophilic reagent for the SN2&#8208;type replacement of selenium versus chloride in the key step of the process while the PhSeCl&#8208;alkene adduct is activated by electrochemically generated PhSeCl3.







Abstract
The first example for the electrochemical cis&#8208;dichlorination of alkenes is presented. The reaction can be performed with little experimental effort by using phenylselenyl chloride as catalyst and tetrabutylammoniumchloride as supporting electrolyte, which also acts as nucleophilic reagent for the SN2&#8208;type replacement of selenium versus chloride. Cyclic voltammetric measurements and control experiments revealed a dual role of phenylselenyl chloride in the reaction. Based on these results a reaction mechanism was postulated, where the key step of the process is the activation of a phenylselenyl chloride&#8208;alkene adduct by electrochemically generated phenylselenyl trichloride. Like this, different aliphatic and aromatic cyclic and acyclic alkenes were converted to the dichlorinated products. Thereby, throughout high diastereoselectivities were achieved for the cis&#8208;chlorinated compounds of &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 or higher.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived Self&#8208;Supported Carbon&#8208;Based Composites for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>

Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. A self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. In this review, we intend to offer a timely and comprehensive summary of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials for electrocatalytic water splitting, and a deep analysis and understanding of the relationship between the component manipulation and the properties of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials is also showed.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for the sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon&#8208;based composites, including heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance. In comparison, a self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Recently, self&#8208;supported metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by coordination of metal centers and organic ligands have been considered as suitable templates/precursors to construct free&#8208;standing carbon&#8208;based composites grown on conductive substrate. MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based composites have various merits, such as the well&#8208;aligned array architecture and evenly distributed active sites, and easy functionalization with other species, which make them suitable alternatives to non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;included electrocatalysts. In this review, we intend to show the research progresses by employment of MOFs as precursors to prepare self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based composites. Focusing on these MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, the latest advances in their controllable synthesis, composition regulation, electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS) are presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are showed for the further developments of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Bipyridine&#8208;Modified DNA Three&#8208;Way Junctions with Amide linkers: Metal&#8208;Dependent Structure Induction and Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen+nickel nexus: A bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structure has been synthesized from three DNA strands modified with a bipyridine (bpy) ligand via a stable amide linker. The bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was thermally stabilized by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex. Structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was achieved by addition or removal of NiII ions. Furthermore, NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was demonstrated by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts.







Abstract
DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structures are essential building blocks for the construction of DNA nanoarchitectures. We have synthesized a bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;modified DNA 3WJ by using a newly designed bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside, Ubpy&#8208;3, in which a bpy ligand is tethered via a stable amide linker. The thermal stability of the bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was greatly enhanced by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex at the junction core (&#916;Tm=+17.7&#8201;&#176;C). Although the stereochemistry of the modification site differs from that of the previously reported bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside Ubpy&#8208;2, the degree of the NiII&#8208;mediated stabilization observed with Ubpy&#8208;3 was comparable to that of Ubpy&#8208;2. Structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was carried out by the addition or removal of NiII ions. Furthermore, NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was performed by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. Both transformations were driven by the formation of NiII(bpy)3 complexes. The structural induction and self&#8208;sorting of bpy&#8208;modified 3WJs are expected to have many potential applications in the development of metal&#8208;responsive DNA materials.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208; and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Substitution Reactions of Propargylic Alcohol Derivatives with Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching between paths: Ruthenium&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohol derivatives have been achieved by using N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones as ambident nucleophiles, whose nucleophilicity is switched between carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered ones by two different catalytic systems, affording propargylic alkylated products and propargylic aminated products, respectively.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohol derivatives with N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones as ambident nucleophiles are achieved in which N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones exhibit impressive different reactivities depending on different catalytic systems, behaving as carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles to give the corresponding propargylic alkylated products in ruthenium catalysis, or as nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles to afford the corresponding propargylic aminated products in copper catalysis. DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the detailed reaction pathways of these two systems. Further transformation of propargylic substituted products affords the corresponding multisubstituted pyrazoles as cyclization products in good to high yields.

         <title>From the {FeIII2Ln2} Butterfly's Perspective: the Magnetic Benefits and Challenges of Cooperativity within 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f Based Coordination Clusters</title>

The well&#8208;known oxo&#8208;centred Fe triangle is used to access the vast majority of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OR)2L2(O2CR)6] butterflies, since it provides a di&#8208;iron central body unit and carboxylate bridges to the wingtips, which are occupied by supplied Ln ions. The remaining coordination sites of the lanthanide are occupied by a multidentate ligand, which can also provide further bridging. This system provides a useful testbed for exploring multiple variations, for example changing the Ln, the bridging carboxylate and the nature of the chelating ligand.







Abstract
In this Review we discuss the tuning handles which can be used to steer the magnetic properties of FeIII&#8208;4&#8201;f &#8220;butterfly&#8221; compounds. The majority of presented compounds were produced in the context of project A3 &#8220;Di&#8208; to tetranuclear compounds incorporating highly anisotropic paramagnetic metal ions&#8221; within the SFB/TRR88 &#8220;3MET&#8221;. These contain {FeIII2Ln2} cores encapsulated in ligand shells which are easy to tune in a &#8220;test&#8208;bed&#8221; system. We identify the following advantages and variables in such systems: (i) the complexes are structurally simple usually with one crystallographically independent FeIII and LnIII, respectively. This simplifies theory and anaylsis; (ii) choosing Fe allows 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to be used as an additional technique which can give information about oxidation levels and spin states, local moments at the iron nuclei and spin&#8208;relaxation and, more importantly, about the anisotropy not only of the studied isotope, but also of elements interacting with this isotope; (iii) isostructural analogues with all the available (i.&#8201;e. not Pm) 4&#8201;f ions can be synthesised, enabling a systematic survey of the influence of the 4&#8201;f ion on the electronic structure; (iv) this cluster type is obtained by reacting [FeIII3O(O2CR)6(L)3](X) (X=anion, L=solvent such as H2O, py) with an ethanolamine&#8208;based ligand L&#8242; and lanthanide salts. This allows to study analogues of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(L&#8242;)2(O2CR)6] using the appropriate iron trinuclear starting materials. (v) the organic main ligand can be readily functionalised, facilitating a systematic investigation of the effect of organic substituents on the ligands on the magnetic properties of the complexes. We describe and discuss 34 {MIII2Ln2} (M=Fe or in one case Al) butterfly compounds which have been reported up to 2020. The analysis of these gives perspectives for designing new SMM systems with specific electronic and magnetic signatures

         <title>gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Substituted Fluoroalkenes as Mimics of Amide Derivatives or Phosphates: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the unique properties of the fluoroalkene moiety &#8208; mimic of amide bond, high strength of C&#8722;F bond &#8208; several gem&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as relevant and stable mimics of important moieties, such as phosphate, urea, carbamate and S&#8208;thiocarbamate. The gem&#8208;heteroatom substituted fluoroalkene scaffold could also be the starting point toward more complex molecules. Herein, the synthetic access to these fluoroalkenes derivatives over the last decade is described.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes have received little attention despite their great potential in medicinal chemistry or in fine chemistry. Indeed, due to the electronic and steric similarity between the fluoroalkene moiety and the amide bond as well as the high strength of the carbon&#8208;fluorine bond, these gem&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as stable mimics of various important organic functions, such as phosphates, carbamates, S&#8208;thiocarbamates and ureas. We present herein an overview describing the syntheses over the last decade of heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes in geminal position. This review will be divided into several sections covering each the common following heteroatom: oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, phosphorus&#8208;, boron&#8208; and silicon&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes.

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size Instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm Switch! Chemical bonds in general become stronger as the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. This correlation has hitherto been considered causal but, here, we show it is not in some remarkable cases. For example, carbon&#8722;halogen bonds become weaker from C&#8722;F to C&#8722;I, despite stronger (not weaker) orbital interactions as the bond overlap increases, because of stronger Pauli repulsion with the larger, more electron&#8208;rich halogen.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically analyzed element&#8722;element bonds of archetypal HnX&#8722;YHn molecules (X, Y=C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I), using density functional theory. One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e.&#8201;g., from C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C&#8722;F to C&#8722;I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electronegativity difference. Instead, we show that the effective atom size (via steric Pauli repulsion) is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance. We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance.

         <title>Indandione&#8208;Terminated Quinoidal Compounds for Low&#8208;Bandgap Small Molecules with Strong Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption: Effect of Conjugation Length on the Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap quinoidal molecule with intense absorption in the first (760&#8211;1000&#8197;nm) and second (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) near&#8208;infrared region was developed by synergistical extending quinoidal core and end groups.







Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors have attracted much attention for their multiple applications in optoelectronics. However, the realization of narrow bandgap is challenging particularly for small molecules. Herein, we have synthesized four quinoidal compounds, i.&#8201;e., QSN3, QSN4, QSN5 and QSN6, with electron rich S,N&#8208;heteroacene as the quinoidal core and indandione as the end&#8208;groups. The optical bandgap of the quinoidal compounds is systematically decreased with the extension of quinoidal skeleton, while maintaining stable closed&#8208;shell ground state. QSN6 absorbs an intense absorption in the first and second near&#8208;infrared region in the solid state, and has extremely low optical bandgap of 0.74&#8197;eV. Cyclic voltammetry analyses reveal that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four quinoidal compounds all lie below &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, resulting in good electron&#8208;transporting characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. These results demonstrated that the combination of &#960;&#8208;extended quinoidal core and end&#8208;groups in quinoidal compounds is an effective strategy for the synthesis of low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with good stability.

         <title>Tunable Synchronicity of Molecular Valence Tautomerism with Macroscopic Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition by Molecular Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synchronicity of molecular valence tautomerism (VT) and macroscopic solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition has been rationally tuned by crystal lattice engineering in a new series of bistable valence tautomeric cobalt complexes [Co(3,6&#8208;DTBQ)2(L)2] (3,6&#8208;DTBQ&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsemiquinonato/catecholato) with two ancillary pyridine ligands (L) substituted with di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexa(ethylene glycol) groups.







Abstract
The combination of a cobalt&#8208;dioxolene core that exhibits valence tautomerism (VT) with pyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid functionalized with chains bearing two, four, or six oxyethylene units led to new complexes ConEGEspy (n&#8201;=&#8201;2, 4, and 6). These complexes commonly form violet crystals of the low&#8208;spin (ls)&#8208;[CoIII(nEGEspy)2(3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)(3,6&#8208;DTBCat)] (ls&#8208;[CoIII], 3,6&#8208;DTBSQ&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl semiquinonato, 3,6&#8208;DTBCat&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl catecholato). Interestingly, violet crystals of Co2EGEspy in the ls&#8208;[CoIII] transitioned into a green liquid, accompanied by an almost complete VT shift (94&#8201;%) to the high&#8208;spin (hs)&#8208;[CoII(nEGEspy)2(3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)2] (hs&#8208;[CoII]) upon melting. In contrast, violet crystals of Co4EGEspy and Co6EGEspy in the ls&#8208;[CoIII] exhibited partial VT (33&#8201;%) and only a 9.3&#8201;% VT shift after melting, respectively. These data demonstrate the tunability of the synchronicity of the molecular VT and macroscopic solid&#8208;liquid transitions by optimizing the tethered chains, thus establishing a new strategy for coupling bistable molecules with the macroscopic world.

         <title>Development of Red&#8208;Shifted and Fluorogenic Nucleoside and Oligonucleotide Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleoside based diarylethenes was modified, with the aim of bathochromically shifting the absorption wavelength in the visible range (&#955;max,vis) and to introduce photomodulatable fluorescence. Extending the &#960;&#8208;system of the bridging unit resulted in a desired red shift of &#955;max,vis and fluorogenicity could be obtained by the introduction of a fluorescent adenosine analogue.







Abstract
The reversible modulation of fluorescence signals by light is of high interest for applications in super&#8208;resolution microscopy, especially on the DNA level. In this article we describe the systematic variation of the core structure in nucleoside&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs), in order to generate intrinsically fluorescent photochromes. The introduction of aromatic bridging units resulted in a bathochromic shift of the visible absorption maximum of the closed&#8208;ring form, but caused reduced thermal stability and switching efficiency. The replacement of the thiophene aryl unit by thiazol improved the thermal stability, whereas the introduction of a benzothiophene unit led to inherent and modulatable turn&#8208;off fluorescence. This feature was further optimized by introducing a fluorescent indole nucleobase into the DAE core, resulting in an effective photoswitch with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.0166 and a fluorescence turn&#8208;off factor of 3.2. The site&#8208;specific incorporation into an oligonucleotide resulted in fluorescence&#8208;switchable DNA with high cyclization quantum yields and switching efficiency, which may facilitate future applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Mechanism Elucidation and Biological Insights of Tellurium(IV)&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
In the search for bioactive organotellurium compounds, promising hypervalent TeIV&#8208;containing heterocycles with possible biological applications have been obtained. 125Te NMR of a series of 16 halogenated organotelluranes confirms that these products contain a Te&#8722;O bond within the five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring. We describe their synthesis, identification of the most favorable mechanism and diastereoselectivity, stability assays and in&#8197;vitro potential against L.&#8197;amazonensis.







Abstract
Inspired by the synthetic and biological potential of organotellurium substances, a series of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring organotelluranes containing a Te&#8722;O bond were synthesized and characterized. Theoretical calculations elucidated the mechanism for the oxidation&#8208;cyclization processes involved in the formation of the heterocycles, consistent with chlorine transfer to hydroxy telluride, followed by a cyclization step with simultaneous formation of the new Te&#8722;O bond and deprotonation of the OH group. Moreover, theoretical calculations also indicated anti&#8208;diastereoisomers to be major products for two chirality center&#8211;containing compounds. Antileishmanial assays against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes disclosed 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurane LQ50 (IC50=4.1&#177;1.0; SI=12), 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurolane LQ04 (IC50=7.0&#177;1.3; SI=7) and 1,2&#955;4&#8208;benzoxatellurole LQ56 (IC50=5.7&#177;0.3; SI=6) as more powerful and more selective compounds than the reference, being up to four times more active. A stability study supported by 125Te NMR analyses showed that these heterocycles do not suffer structural modifications in aqueous&#8208;organic media or at temperatures up to 65&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Ultrahigh Rate Capability and Lifespan MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF Electrode for High Performance Battery&#8208;Type Supercapacitor</title>

Nanoflower structural MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite prepared by in&#8197;situ growth of Ni&#8208;MOF on the surface of MnCo2O4 nanorods derived from Co/Mn&#8208;MOF at 600&#8201;&#176;C has a high cycling stability and outstanding rate performance as supercapacitor electrode material.







Abstract
MnCo2O4 is derived from a Co/Mn bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). Then Ni&#8208;MOF is directly grown on the surface of the obtained MnCo2O4 to form a nano&#8208;flower structure with small balls. A large surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo2O4 and porosity of Ni&#8208;MOF allow the prepared MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite material to deliver an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, an appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo2O4 precursor is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo2O4 and electrochemical performances of the resulted composite material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo2O4&#8208;600/Ni&#8208;MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance (when the current density increases from 1 to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41&#8201;%) and good cycle stability (the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74&#8201;% after 20&#8201;000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF has a good application prospect in the market.

A large surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and porosity of Ni-MOF allow the prepared MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni-MOF composite material to deliver an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, an appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; precursor is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and electrochemical performances of the resulted composite material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-600/Ni-MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance (when the current density increases from 1 to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41&#8201;%) and good cycle stability (the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74&#8201;% after 20&#8201;000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni-MOF has a good application prospect in the market.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Singlet&#8208;triplet gap energies are computed for simple pnictinidene moieties to offer theoretical insights and motivate future work on heavier pnictogen containing species.







Abstract
Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST=ESinglet&#8722;ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8722;R; Pn=P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8722;PH2 (&#8722;3.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and P&#8722;NH2 (&#8722;0.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8722;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Interactions in d/l Peptide Nanotubes: Studies by Crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics</title>

Cyclic d/l peptide nanotubes (CPNs) have diverse applications in biological and materials science. We study the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CPN stability and report crystal structures of non&#8208;tubular folded peptide conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations correlate with measured H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives, showing how the composition and relative orientation of amino acids are key factors in CPN stability.







Abstract
Our understanding of the factors affecting the stability of cyclic d/l peptide (CP) nanotubes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CP nanotube stability through X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterise the distinct CP&#8208;CP alignments that can form and identify stable and unstable dimers by MD simulation. We measure H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives of synthesised CPs by 1H&#8722;D exchange experiments and find good correlation with predicted CP&#8208;CP stabilities. We find that hydrophobic amino acids improve CP dimer stability but experimentally reduce solubility. Charged amino acids either increase or decrease CP dimer stability depending on the relative orientation and composition of charged groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are solved for two CPs, revealing non&#8208;tubular folded conformations. Ultimately, this work will assist the educated design of stable tubular structures for potential applications in biomedicine.

         <title>Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids</title>

Spatial distance has a major impact on the photoswitching in NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids. By careful molecular design and using MD simulations it was possible to gain valuable insight into the mechanism underlying these unique photoswitches.







Abstract
With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back&#8208;reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C60. In this work, the fundamental processes within these hybrids has been investigated. Variation of the linker unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction, two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids having a long&#8208;rigid and a short&#8208;rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC&#8211;C60 distance of up to 14.2&#8197;&#197;. By comparing the NBD&#8211;QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back&#8208;reaction.

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The mesoporous PdNi/Ni nanoparticles assembled nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) have been synthesized via replacement reaction, in which nickel nanowires serve as sacrificial template to form tubular structure and the diblock copolymer induce the formation of mesoporous structures. Due to the mesoporous nanoparticle structure and tubular geometry, the mPdNi/Ni NTs have better catalytic performance than mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black for ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibite superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Strapped Porphyrin BODIPY Rotaxanes for Dual Optical and Electrochemical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14550-14559, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes have been prepared according to an active metal template strategy. Capitalising on the augmented anion affinities by virtue of axle triazole ligation to macrocyclic zinc(II) metalloporphyrin, the incorporation of fluorogenic BODIPY and redox&#8208;active porphyrin transducing groups allows dual&#8208;channel sensing of anions by quenching BODIPY emission and through cathodic perturbations of porphyrin oxidation redox couples.







Abstract
Anion receptors employing two distinct sensory mechanisms are rare. Herein, we report the first examples of halogen&#8208;bonding porphyrin BODIPY [2]rotaxanes capable of both fluorescent and redox electrochemical sensing of anions. 1H NMR, UV/visible and electrochemical studies revealed rotaxane axle triazole group coordination to the zinc(II) metalloporphyrin&#8208;containing macrocycle component, serves to preorganise the rotaxane binding cavity and dramatically enhances anion binding affinities. Mechanically bonded, integrated&#8208;axle BODIPY and macrocycle strapped metalloporphyrin motifs enable the anion recognition event to be sensed by the significant quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore and cathodic perturbations of the metalloporphyrin P/P+. redox couple.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled, Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>

Motion capture: Gel beads that incorporate a self&#8208;assembled low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) into an agarose polymer gel particle are reported; when loaded with ethanol and placed in water, they self&#8208;propel as a result of the Marangoni effect. The presence of the LMWG significantly increases their mobility and endows them with unique functions, such as enhanced ability to adsorb a pollutant dye.







Abstract
Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate an enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water owing to the Marangoni effect changes in surface tension caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move farther and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8220;stamp&#8221; &#8211; circles moved the furthest, whereas stars showed more rotation on their own axes. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of noncovalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery suggests that adding them to self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.

         <title>Effect of Arylmethylene Substitutions on Molecular Structure, Optoelectronic Properties and Photovoltaic Performance of Dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors</title>

Arylmethylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains: Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains have been developed to systemically investigate the impact of arylmethylene substitution and its number on molecular structure, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Better light&#8208;harvesting properties and molecular planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMO levels are achieved, enabling improvements in device efficiency both for halogenated and non&#8208;halogenated processing solvents.







Abstract
Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) were developed that feature methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains, to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA without conjugated side chains. The synthesized SMAs were tested in polymer solar cells for examples of their applicability. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.

Hold tight, shine bright: A novel method for the development of lanthanide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, taking advantage of an EuIII complex with an organic ligand covalently bound to the silica nanoparticle supports at two binding sites has been demonstrated. The hybrid nanoluminophore exhibited higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previous EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials.







Abstract
In this study, we have demonstrated a two&#8208;legged, upright molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent LnIII&#8208;silica nanomaterials. A novel EuIII&#8208;silica hybrid nanoparticle was developed by using a doubly binding TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 (TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) linker. The TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 was confirmed by 1H, 31P, 29Si NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Luminescent Eu(hfa)3 and Eu(tfc)3 moieties (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3&#8208;(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed onto TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3&#8208;modified silica nanoparticles, producing Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2 and Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2, respectively. Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 exhibited the higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 showed an extra&#8208;large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54&#8201;%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3)2 was found to be 39&#8201;%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 linker is a promising candidate for development of EuIII&#8208;based luminescent materials.

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C&#8201;N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14410-14417, October 19, 2021. </description>

Gold(III) metallacycles. Monocyclometalated gold(III) metallacycles with tunable emission properties have been demonstrated. The complexes show highly emissive triplet excited states (T1) with long excited state lifetimes. The T1 of the complexes and the triplet excited state of dioxygen (3O2) lie in a delicate balance resulting in an efficient quenching of these triplet states to generate 1O2.

Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and photoluminescent properties of four cyclometalated (C&#8201;N)&#8208;type gold(III) complexes bearing a bidentate diacetylide ligand, tolan&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diacetylide (tda), are reported. The complexes exhibit highly tunable excited state properties and show photoluminescence (PL) across the entire visible spectrum from sky&#8208;blue (&#955;PL=493&#8197;nm) to red (&#955;PL=675&#8197;nm) with absolute PL quantum yields (PLQY) of up to 75&#8201;% in solution, the highest PLQY found for any monocyclometalated Au(III) complex in solution. As a consequence of the use of the strongly rigidifying diacetylide bidentate ligand, a significant increase in the excited state lifetimes (&#964;0=16&#8211;258 &#956;s) was found in solution and in thin films. The complexes showed remarkable singlet oxygen generation in aerated solution with absolute singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#981;1&#916;) values reaching up to 7.5&#215;10&#8722;5 and singlet oxygen lifetimes (&#964;01&#916;) in the range of 66&#8211;95 &#956;s. Furthermore, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates of singlet oxygen were determined using the &#981;1&#916; and &#964;01&#916; values and correlations are drawn between the formation of singlet oxygen and its interaction with cyclometalated (C&#8201;N) gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Promoting renewable energy production: LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts have been prepared by a sol&#8208;gel protocol. Subsequent calcination at 700&#8201;&#176;C yields a macroporous material with modest surface area. Hydrogen reduction induces surface defects, in particular a high concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits a significantly higher current density at lower overpotential, with faster kinetics and superior stability for oxygen evolution for water splitting.







Abstract
Perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high efficiency and durability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influence their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700&#8201;&#176;C calcined LaNiO3 induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO3; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of 380&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ valence states, which quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Further, it reveals that the formation of oxygen vacancies is thermodynamically more favourable on the surface than in the bulk; it increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO3 in accordance with the enhanced OER activity that is observed.

         <title>Structural Modulation on NiCo2S4Nanoarray by N Doping to Enhance 2e&#8208;ORR Selectivity for Photothermal AOPs and Zn&#8722;O2Batteries**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Zn&#8722;O2 batteries: A 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;active electrocatalyst was synthesized by loading N&#8208;doped NiCo2S4 nanoarray on filter paper derived carbon paper with two coordination complexes as precursors. The electrocatalyst also exhibits good photothermal properties. Under the heating of the photothermal effect, H2O2 produced by 2e&#8208;ORR is decomposed and releases .OH radicals, which can degrade antibiotics, pesticides, and phenol through advanced oxidation processes. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and Zn as anode, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery was constructed.







Abstract
As a H2O2 generator, a 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in the advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo2S4 towards the 2e&#8722; reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S2&#8722;. The result implies that this weakens the interaction between NiCo2S4 and OOH*, suppresses O&#8722;O bond breaking and enhances H2O2 selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H2O2 produced by the oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and releaseOH, which degrades organic pollutants through the advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over the traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe2+ free character. With Zn as anode and the electrocatalyst as cathode material, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery is assembled. It achieves electricity generation and photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process simultaneously.

         <title>Target&#8208;Dependent Protection of DNA Aptamers against Nucleolytic Digestion Enables Signal&#8208;On Biosensing with Toehold&#8208;Mediated Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14543-14549, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digestion protection: a fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase followed by toehold mediated strand displacement of the target by a circular template to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing sub&#8208;nanomolar detection limits for protein targets, including in serum and plasma.







Abstract
We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5&#8242;&#8208;end protects it from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn&#8208;on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real&#8208;time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay.

More than a separator: An integrated functional interface on separator of lithium&#8722;sulfur battery is fabricated with graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowires (G@MC). The G@MC possesses &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; catalytic Mn2+ sites and good electronic conductivity, which endows the batteries with fast kinetic conversion of polysulfides and rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. The reversible and strong chemical interaction between intermediates and G@MC is beneficial for achieving enhanced cycling stability and rate capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have attracted great attention due to their high theoretical energy density. The rapid redox conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is effective for solving the serious shuttle effect and improving the utilization of active materials. The functional design of the separator interface with fast charge transfer and active catalytic sites is desirable for accelerating the conversion of intermediates. Herein, a graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowire (G@MC) was prepared and utilized to engineer the separator interface. G@MC with active Mn2+ sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn&#8722;S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+ sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS via the spontaneous &#8220;self&#8208;redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC&#8208;based battery exhibits only 0.038&#8201;% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0&#8197;C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Are Heavy Pnictogen&#8208;&#960; Interactions Really &#8220;&#960; Interactions&#8221;?</title>

Is it, or is it not &#960;? The interaction of heavy pnictogen compounds with benzene and cyclohexane provides an insightful example of whether such interactions are indeed &#8220;&#960; interactions&#8221;. High&#8208;level, ab&#8208;initio calculations show that in both cases the interaction is dominated by dispersion and that this contribution is practically the same with or without a &#960; system.







Abstract
The noncovalent interactions of heavy pnictogens with &#960;&#8208;arenes play a fundamental role in fields like crystal engineering or catalysis. The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of &#960;&#8208;arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat&#8208;twist conformers, and thus suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilise the desired conformation.

         <title>Deuterated Indocyanine Green (ICG) with Extended Aqueous Storage Shelf&#8208;Life: Chemical and Clinical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14535-14542, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuterium atom in the right place mitigates the 60&#8208;year problem of aqueous Indocyanine Green (ICG) instability. A clinical stock solution of heavy ICG in water can be stored for an extended period without significant loss of fluorescence brightness; this will improve the effectiveness of various biomedical imaging, diagnostic and therapy procedures.







Abstract
Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dye that is used extensively for various imaging and diagnostic procedures. One drawback with ICG is its instability in water, which means that reconstituted clinical doses have to be used very shortly after preparation. Two deuterated versions of ICG were prepared with deuterium atoms on the heptamethine chain, and the spectral, physiochemical, and photostability properties were quantified. A notable mechanistic finding is that self&#8208;aggregation of ICG in water strongly favors dye degradation by a photochemical oxidative dimerization reaction that gives a nonfluorescent product. Storage stability studies showed that replacement of C&#8722;H with C&#8722;D decreased the dimerization rate constant by a factor of 3.1, and it is likely that many medical and preclinical procedures will benefit from the longer shelf&#8208;lives of these two deuterated ICG dyes. The discovery that ICG self&#8208;aggregation promotes photoinduced electron transfer can be exploited as a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation photodynamic therapies.

         <dc:description>
Surfaces are ubiquitous in nanomaterials at large. Colloidal nanocrystals provide a versatile platform to conveniently study in the solution phase the impact of surface chemistry on the electronic structure of nanomaterials. On page 14359, the impact of the post&#8208;synthesis surface chemistry modification on the light absorption properties of colloidal quantum dots is discussed. A unified description of the contribution of the surface species to the ground state electronic structure of the overall, ligand&#8208;coordinated quantum dot is attempted.

         <title>Frontispiece: Noncovalent Interactions at Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tuneable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts do not effectively catalyze organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts. For more information, see the Minireview by K. T. Mahmudov et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;14370.

Explaining the oxidation&#8211;cyclization mechanism of heterocycles containing Te&#8722;O bonds. The structures of halogenated Te&#8208;containing heterocycles have been elucidated, and computational methods showed them to be prepared in a two&#8208;step oxidation&#8211;cyclization. The three compounds shown represent both the structural diversity and the biological application of these hypervalent compounds as leishmanicides.

A new class of monocyclometalated gold(III) diacetylide metallacycles has been synthesized and characterized. Photophysical investigations of these complexes revealed strong phosphorescence with very long excited&#8208;state lifetimes. We demonstrate the efficient singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation properties of these metallacycles through their ability to sensitize singlet oxygen. The complexes&#8242; varying ability to generate singlet oxygen opens avenues for their potential use in catalysis and biomedical applications.

         <title>Cover Feature: Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (Chem. Eur. J. 58/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14355-14355, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of defect generation by thermal reduction on the structure and electrocatalytic performance of LaNiO3 has been examined in a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Surface defects, predominantly surface oxygen vacancies, promote oxygen evolution over LaNiO3 resulting in a significantly lower overpotential (380&#8197;mV) for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faster kinetics (70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope) and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes to conventionally prepared LaNiO3. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Arandiyan, Y. Wang, T. Maschmeyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102672).

A two&#8208;legged, standing&#8208;up molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent EuIII&#8211;silica nanomaterials is demonstrated. By using a Eu(hfa)3 complex with TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)3 (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) covalently bonded to the silica nanoparticles at two binding sites, nanoluminophores Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8208;Si)2&#8211;SiO2 were developed that have an excellent intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93%) and long emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms).

         <title>Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14359-14369, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligands at the surface of colloidal quantum dots are intrinsically electronically coupled to the inorganic semiconductor core thus affecting the overall ground state electronic structure and, consequently, the light absorption properties.







Abstract
At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211; and wires and wells, too &#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other's electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.&#8201;e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.

Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tunable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts (solvento complexes) do not catalyze effectively organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts in both homogenous and heterogenous catalysis. In this minireview, we discuss several relevant examples, based on X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, in which the hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds, as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8211;&#960; and pancake interactions, are used as a synthon in the decoration of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes.

Stepwise reduction of germylenes via stable and isolable germanium radicals yields germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands. The anions contain a highly electron&#8208;rich germanium centre with significant ylidone character and are efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles that react even with weak electrophiles.







Abstract
Rare mononuclear and helical chain low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands were synthesised by stepwise reduction from corresponding germylene precursors via stable and isolable germanium radicals. The electronic structures of the anions can be described with ylidene and ylidone resonance forms with the Ge&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;electrons capable of binding even weak electrophiles. The germanylidene anions reacted with CO2 to give &#956;&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O complexes, a rare coordination mode for low&#8208;valent germanium and inaccessible for the related neutral germylones. These results implicate low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions as efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles for activation of small molecules.

         <title>Backbonding in Thorium(IV) and Uranium(IV) Diarsenido Complexes with tBuNC and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14396-14400, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare phenomenon: A pronounced shift to lower frequency in the IR spectra of isostructural ThIV and UIV complexes of isocyanide and carbonyl indicates strong backbonding between the actinide and ligand. Quantum mechanical calculations show that charge transfer from an An&#8722;As &#963;&#8208;bond to the &#960;* orbital of the ligand is responsible for the strong donor&#8208;acceptor interaction.







Abstract
The coordination of tBuNC and CO with the diarsenido complexes (C5Me5)2An(&#951;2&#8208;As2Mes2), An=Th, U, has been investigated. For the first time, a comparison between isostructural complexes of ThIV and UIV has been possible with CO; density functional calculations indicated an appreciable amount of &#960; backbonding that originates from charge transfer from an actinide&#8208;arsenic sigma bond. The calculated CO stretching frequencies in the ThIV and UIV diarsenido complexes are consistent with the experimental measurements, both show large shifts to lower frequency. We demonstrate that the &#960; backbonding is crucial to explaining the red shifts of CO frequency upon AnIV complex formation. Interestingly, this interaction essentially correlates to the parallel orientation of &#960;*(C&#8722;O) orbitals relative to the An&#8722;As bond.

         <title>Selective One&#8208;Pot Syntheses of Mixed Silicon&#8208;Germanium Heteroadamantane Clusters</title>

Toward novel nanoclusters: The fourfold SiCl3&#8208;substituted Si4Ge6 ([0]), Si5Ge5 ([1]), and Si6Ge4 ([2]) heteroadamantane cores are accessible directly from Me2GeCl2 and Si2Cl6/Cl&#8722; in a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient synthesis. In a chloride ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement, [2] is converted into [1] at room temperature and into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
SixGey alloys are emerging materials for modern semiconductor technology. Well&#8208;defined model systems of the bulk structures aid in understanding their intrinsic characteristics. Three such model clusters have now been realized in the form of the SixGey heteroadamantanes [0], [1], and [2] through selective one&#8208;pot syntheses starting from Me2GeCl2, Si2Cl6, and [nBu4N]Cl. Compound [0] contains six GeMe2 and four SiSiCl3 vertices, whereas one and two of the GeMe2 groups are replaced by SiCl2 moieties in compounds [1] and [2], respectively. Chloride&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement quantitatively converts [2] into [1] at room temperature and finally into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is not only remarkable in view of the rigidity of these cage structures but also sheds light on the assembly mechanism.

A novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300&#8197;nm) and suitable band structure was successfully synthesized, and it functioned as an efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalytst for photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines under the irradiation of white (400&#8211;830&#8197;nm), and red light (660&#8211;680&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Imines are important intermediates in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imines and has attracted great attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8211;1300&#8197;nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97&#8201;%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel two-dimensional porphyrin&lt;/b&gt;-based covalent organic framework with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), wide light absorption range (200-1300&#8197;nm) and suitable band structure was successfully synthesized, and it functioned as an efficient metal-free heterogeneous photocatalytst for photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines under the irradiation of white (400&#8211;830&#8197;nm), and red light (660&#8211;680&#8197;nm).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imines are important intermediates in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imines and has attracted great attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two-dimensional porphyrin-based covalent organic framework (Por-BC-COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), wide light absorption range (200&#8211;1300&#8197;nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por-BC-COF can be used as a metal-free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97&#8201;%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light-driven organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting the structural metamorphosis of polymers to &#8216;wrap&#8217;&#160;micron&#8208;sized spherical objects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is growing interest in developing methods to &#8216;wrap&#8217; nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects within films that may offer protection, enhance their stability or improve performance.&#160; We describe the successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film. This approach utilizes polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly cross&#8208;linked to intermoleculary cross&#8208;linked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur. This work is significant as it suggests that nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects such as virus&#8208;like particles, bacteria or mammalian cells&#8212;all of which may benefit from additional environmental protection or stabilization in emerging applications&#8212;may also be &#8216;wrapped&#8217; by this approach.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of dipolar molecular rotor compounds was designed, synthesized and adsorbed as self&#8208;assembled 2D arrays on Ag(111) surfaces. The title molecules are constructed from three building blocks: (a) 4,8,12&#8208;trioxatriangulene (TOTA) platforms that are known to physisorb on metal surfaces such as Au(111) and Ag(111), (b) phenyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that function as pivot joints to reduce the barrier to rotation, (c) pyridine and pyridazine units as small dipolar units on top. Theoretical calculations and STM investigations hint at the fact that the dipoles of neighbouring rotors interact through space via pairs of energetically favourable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay of Polarity and Confinement in Asymmetric Catalysis with Chiral Rh Diene Complexes in Microemulsions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microemulsions provide a unique opportunity to tailor the polarity and liquid confinement in asymmetric catalysis via nanoscale polar and nonpolar domains separated by a surfactant film. For chiral diene Rh complexes, the influence of counterion and surfactant film on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity remained elusive. To explore this issue chiral norbornadiene Rh(X) complexes (X = OTf, OTs, OAc, PO  2  F  2  ) were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. These complexes were used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to  N&#8208;  tosylimine in microemulsions stabilized either exclusively by  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;  &#223;  &#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (C  8  G  1  ) or a C  8  G  1  &#8208;film doped with anionic or cationic surfactants (AOT, SDS and DTAB). The Rh(OAc) complex showed the largest dependence on the composition of the microemulsion, yielding up to 59&#160;%&#160;(90&#160;%ee) for the surfactant film doped with 5&#160;wt.% of AOT as compared to 52&#160;% (58&#160;%ee) for neat C  8  G  1  at constant surfactant concentration. The larger domains, determined by SAXS analysis, enabled an increase in yield and selectivity while the reaction rate almost remained constant according to kinetic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Total syntheses of conjugation&#8208;ready repeating units of Acinetobacter baumannii AB5075 for glycoconjugate vaccine development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acinetobacter baumannii  is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious nosocomial infections. One of the multidrug&#8208;resistant strains, AB5075, can result in bacteremia, pneumonia and wound infections associated with high morbidity and mortality. The structurally unique glycans on the surface of these bacteria are attractive targets for the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. Here, we report the first total synthesis of the densely functionalized trisaccharide repeating unit of  A. baumannii  AB5075 as well as two analogues. The construction of 1,2&#8208;  cis  linkages between the rare sugars relies on a double&#8208;serial inversion strategy. The judicious selection of building blocks and reaction conditions allowed for stereoselective glycosylations, the installation of acetamido groups and the (  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl chain.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ  observation of  ferroelastic domain and phase transition in a three&#8208;dimensional molecular crystal.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Massive efforts have been devoted to designing molecular ferroic materials by molecular modification. For molecular ferroelastic, previous work is focused on the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelastic domains, however, few are related to controlling the ferroelastic domain by the stress. Inspired by the &#8220;quasi&#8208;spherical theory&#8221; and fluorination effect, we designed a more flexible (MedabcoF)  2+  (MedabcoF= 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) cation by introducing a methyl group and a fluorine atom at the two symmetrical ends of the Dabco (1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and synthesized a hybrid 3D perovskite (MedabcoF)Rb(BF  4  )  3  (1) which displays three reversible phase transitions accompanying dual ferroelastic behavior. Besides, it not only exhibits ferroelastic domains switching by the thermal stimulation, and the sensitive reaction of in situ domains under the stress of it is also realized. This work not only achieves a force&#8208;controlled ferroelastic domain but develops a more profound comprehension of the relationship between the thermal motion behavior of guest cations and the intriguing properties of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Access to Cyanated N&#8208;Heterocycles via Direct Flow&#8208;Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitriles are recurring motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile functional groups in synthetic chemistry. Despite recent progress, direct introduction of a nitrile moiety in heteroarenes remains challenging. Recent developments in electrochemical reactions pave the way to more practical cyanation protocols. However, currently available methods typically require hazardous cyanide sources, expensive mediators, and often suffer from narrow substrate scope and laborious reaction set&#8208;up. To address the limitations of current synthetic methods, we report here an effective, sustainable, and scalable procedure for the direct C(  sp  2  )&#8208;H cyanation of aromatic  N  &#8208;heterocycles with a user&#8208;friendly flow&#8208;electrochemical set&#8208;up. Furthermore, high substrate and functional group tolerance is demonstrated, allowing for late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug&#8208;like scaffolds such as natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel route for the easy production of thermochromic VO2 nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a simple, fast and dry method for the fabrication of a thermochromic product with a high load of VO  2  &#160;(M1) consisting of the controlled heat treatment of pure vanadium nanoparticles in air is presented. After a complete design of experiments, it is concluded that the most&#160;direct way to attain the maximum transformation of V into VO  2  (M1) consists of one cycle with a fast heating ramp of 42  o  Cs  &#8722;1  , followed by keeping 700  o  C for 530&#8208;600 seconds, and a subsequent cooling at 0.05  o  Cs  &#8722;1  . Careful examination of these results lead to a second optimum, even more suitable for industrial production (quicker and less energy&#8208;intensive because of its lower temperatures and shorter times), consisting of subjecting V to two consecutive cycles of temperatures and times (625  o  C for 5 minutes) with similar preheating&#160;but a much faster postcooling (~8  o  Cs  &#8722;1  ). These green reactions only use the power for heating a tube open to atmosphere and a vanadium precursor; without assistance of reactive gases or catalysts, and no special vacuum or pressure requirements. The best products present similar thermochromic properties but higher thermal stability than commercial VO  2  particles. These&#160;methods can be combined with VO  2  doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Putting anion&#8208;&#960; interactions at work for catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its discovery two decades ago, anion&#8211;&#960; interaction has been increasingly recognized as an important driving force. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts on the ground&#8208;state anion&#8211;&#960; binding and recognition have laid the bases for exploring its relevance in catalysis. Accordingly, the concept of &#8220;anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis&#8221; that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface (&#960;&#8208;acidic surface) for anionic reaction intermediate and transition state stabilization has emerged. This article shortly illustrates the emergence and development of this concept, aiming to provide an emphasis on the general concept and key progress in this exciting area. To highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8211;&#960; interactions, the contents are organized according to their role engaged in catalytic process, e.g. from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, mainly by a single &#960;&#8208;face, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation. A concluding remark and outlook on future development of this field is also given.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN peptide complexes increases ROS levels, DNA cleavage and antiproliferative activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the a &#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2 &#8594; &#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production ( . OH and H 2 O 2 ). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC 50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The modular synthesis of Au(I)/Ru(II) decorated mono&#8208; and heterobimetallic complexes with &#960;&#8208;conjugated [2.2]paracyclophane is described.

         <dc:description>Indenyl&#160;rhodium NHC complexes [Rh(&#951;5&#8208;Ind)(NHC)(L)] were synthesised for SIPr&#160;with L = C2H4  (1), CO (2a) and COE (3), for SIMes&#160;with L = CO (2b) and COE (4), and IMes&#160;with L = CO (2c) and COE (5). Reaction of SIPr with [Rh(Cp*)(C2H4)2] did not give the desired SIPr complex demonstrating the &#8216;indenyl effect&#8217; in the synthesis of  1  . Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3  to  3  proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6).&#160;Tethered&#8208;fluorenyl&#8208;NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5&#8208;C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4  :  11, L=COE:  12  , L=CO:  13; R=Mes, L=COE:  14  , L=CO:  15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE:  16  , L=CO:  17) were also synthesised.  3  and  1  were the best catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene using B2pin2  (97% and 93% PhBpin respectively with 5 mol% catalyst, 24 hr, 80&#176;C), with SIPr a better ligand than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl&#8208;tethered&#8208;NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2  at 120&#176;C and 140&#176;C respectively showed high conversions by NMR spectroscopy&#160;into octyl and decylBpin over 4 &#8211; 7 days demonstrating catalysed sp3  C&#8208;H borylation. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420 nm light confirmed the dissociation of alkene&#160;ligands whereas CO complexes were inert.

         <title>Spectral Signatures of Oxidation States in a Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>

Tracing fingerprints. Key IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures to differentiate oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;oxo vanadate catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n&#8211; are identified. During oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn
], in the UV/Vis spectrum a band at about 570&#8197;nm increases while another one at 850&#8197;nm vanishes. In the IR spectra, oxidation leads to a remarkable shift of the V=O stretch mode to higher energies.







Abstract
We report IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures that allow discriminating between the oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;based water oxidation catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]3&#8722;. Simulated IR spectra show that V=O stretching vibrations in the 900&#8211;1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region shift consistently by about 20&#8197;cm&#8722;1 per oxidation equivalent. Multiple bands in the 1450&#8211;1550&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region also change systematically upon oxidation/reduction. The computed UV/Vis spectra predict that the spectral range above 350&#8197;nm is characteristic of the managanese&#8208;oxo cubane oxidation state, whereas transitions at higher energy are due to the vanadate ligand. The presence of absorption signals above 680&#8197;nm is indicative of the presence of MnIII atoms. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of the oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn
] showed that the change in oxidation state can indeed be tracked by both IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and growth mechanisms of spherical particles of infinite coordination polymers (ICPs) is discussed. Main reported applications for micro&#8208; and nanospheres of ICPs exhibiting luminescent behavior are presented, including chemical sensing, light emission, bioimaging and templating by using topotactic transformations. Additional insights on the challenges for future applications are also given.







Abstract
Coordination polymers have been extensively studied in recent years. Some of these materials can exhibit several properties such as permanent porosity, high surface area, thermostability and light emission, as well as open sites for chemical functionalization. Concerning the fact that this kind of compounds are usually solids, the size and morphology of the particles are important parameters when an application is desired. Inside this context, there is a subclass of coordination polymers, named infinite coordination polymers (ICPs), which auto&#8208;organize as micro&#8208; or nanoparticles with low crystallinity. Specifically, the particles exhibiting spherical shapes and reduced sizes can be better dispersed, enter cells much easier than bulk crystals and be converted to inorganic materials by topotactic transformation. Luminescent ICPs, in particular, can find applications in several areas, such as sensing probes, light&#8208;emitting devices and bioimaging. In this review, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of ICP&#8208;based spherical particles, including the growth mechanisms, some applications for luminescent ICPs and the challenges to overcome in future commercial usage of these materials.

         <title>CdS Reinforced with CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH Core&#8208;shell Co&#8208;catalyst Demonstrate High Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Durability in Anhydrous Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new core&#8208;shell structured co&#8208;catalyst CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH and CdS are coupled by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly to form a composite catalyst 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS, which exhibits high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen evolution performance and stability under visible light (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm). CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH provides sufficient space for the effective load of CdS. Meanwhile, the effective interface contact accelerates the transfer of electrons and jointly promotes the precipitation of hydrogen.







Abstract
At present, inefficient charge separation of single photocatalyst impedes the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, the CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH core&#8208;shell co&#8208;catalyst was cleverly designed, which exhibit high activity and high stability of hydrogen evolution in anhydrous ethanol system when coupled with CdS. Under visible light (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm) irradiation, the 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS composite photocatalyst exhibits a surprisingly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 20.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 59&#8197;times than that of the original CdS. Continuous light for 20&#8197;h still showed good cycle stability.

The fluorescence (PL), ultraviolet&#8208;visible diffuse reflectance (UV&#8208;vis) and photoelectrochemical tests show that the coupling of CdS and CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH not only accelerates the effective transfer of charges, but also greatly increases the absorption range of CdS to visible light. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution activity of the composite photocatalyst has been significantly improved. This work will provide new insights for the construction of new co&#8208;catalysts and the development of composite catalysts for hydrogen evolution in multiple systems.

&lt;p&gt;The new core-shell structured co-catalyst CoS&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH and CdS are coupled by electrostatic self-assembly to form a composite catalyst 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS, which exhibits high-efficiency hydrogen evolution performance and stability under visible light (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm). CoS&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH provides sufficient space for the effective load of CdS. Meanwhile, the effective interface contact accelerates the transfer of electrons and jointly promotes the precipitation of hydrogen.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Fused 1,4&#8208;Diazapentalene: A Stable C=N&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System with Restored Antiaromaticity</title>

         <dc:description>
Best of both worlds: The thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene with two C=N bonds (TAP) was synthesized as a stable compound. The fused thiophene rings restored the antiaromatic character of the 8&#960;&#8208;electron system diminished by C=N doping while imparting thermal stability. TAP readily underwent hydrogenation owing to the pronounced aromaticity of the hydrogenated product. Moreover, the high electrophilicity of C=N bonds of TAP led to dense &#960;&#8208;stacking in the solid state.







Abstract
A thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N&#8208;containing 4n&#8201;&#960;&#8208;electron system that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene moiety resulted in a much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the eight&#8208;membered&#8208;ring periphery caused by stabilization of the less&#8208;stable bond&#8208;shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and the high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H2&#8208;TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;&#8208;stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosylbarbiturates into Multiresponsive Alginate&#8208;Like Supramolecular Hydrogel Fibers and Vesicle Hydrogel</title>

         <dc:description>
Barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation on unprotected carbohydrates enabled the molecular design of amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl barbiturates as hydrogelators. The single&#8208;tailed glycoamphiphiles self&#8208;assembled into alginate&#8208;like multistimuli&#8208;triggered and responsive supramolecular hydrogel fibers. While, the double&#8208;tailed glycoamphiphiles led to vesicle hydrogels. Barbituric acid proves to be an efficient and versatile chemical toolbox for the access and design of glycoconjugates.







Abstract
Ordered molecular self&#8208;assembly of glycoamphiphiles has been regarded as an attractive, practical and bottom&#8208;up approach to obtain stable, structurally well&#8208;defined, and functional mimics of natural polysaccharides. This study describes a versatile and rational design of carbohydrate&#8208;based hydrogelators through N,N&#8217;&#8208;substituted barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation onto unprotected carbohydrates in water. Amphiphilic N&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;maltosylbarbiturates self&#8208;assembled into pH&#8208; and calcium&#8208;triggered alginate&#8208;like supramolecular hydrogel fibers with a multistimuli responsiveness to temperature, pH and competitive metal chelating agent. In addition, amphiphilic N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;maltosylbarbiturates formed vesicle gels in pure water that were scarcely observed for glyco&#8208;hydrogelators. Finally, barbituric acid worked as a multitasking group allowing chemoselective ligation onto reducing&#8208;end carbohydrates, structural diversity, stimuli&#8208;sensitiveness, and supramolecular interactions by hydrogen bonding.

         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based macrocycle (WPCTX) was prepared with satisfying yield and its host&#8208;guest properties were investigated. Based on this, tetraphenylethylene guest molecules (G) self&#8208;assembled with WPCTX to form WPCTX&#8835;G nanoparticles (NPs) acting as donors in water. Moreover, two hydrophobic fluorescent dyes, Eosin Y (ESY) and Nile red (NiR), were encapsulated in NPs to construct artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems with high antenna effect.







Abstract
On the basis of cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX), a novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based CTX derivative (WPCTX) was prepared with facile synthetic procedure and satisfying yield. Several model guest molecules were selected to investigate WPCTX&#8242;s host&#8208;guest properties. Based on the study of the host and model guest complexation, a tetraphenylethylene derivative from model guest was employed as a guest molecule (G) to form WPCTX&#8835;G nanoparticles (NPs) with WPCTX through further supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in water. Moreover, a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Eosin Y(ESY) or Nile red (NiR), was encapsulated in WPCTX&#8835;G NPs to construct two types of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems. Their high antenna effect demonstrated such NPs successfully mimicked light&#8208;harvesting systems in nature.

         <title>Iodine(I) and Silver(I) Complexes of Benzoimidazole and Pyridylcarbazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver(I) complexes of benzoimidazole and carbazole&#8208;derived sp2 N&#8208;containing Lewis bases are synthesized and the isostructural iodine(I) complexes with a strong 3&#8208;center 4&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond are obtained through the [N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N]+&#8594;[N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ cation exchange reaction. The unambiguous confirmation of the complex formation is obtained in the solution state using NMR spectroscopy, and in the solid&#8208;state, with single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The synthesis of iodine(I) complexes with either benzoimidazole or carbazole&#8208;derived sp2 N&#8208;containing Lewis bases is described, as well as their corresponding silver(I) complexes. The addition of elemental iodine to the linear two&#8208;coordinate Ag(I) complexes produces iodine(I) complexes with a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ bond. The 1H and 1H&#8208;15N HMBC NMR studies unambiguously confirm the formation of the complexes in all cases via the [N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N]+&#8594;[N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ cation exchange, with the 15N NMR chemical shift change between 94 to 111&#8197;ppm when compared to the free ligand. The single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on eight I+ complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ bonds with I&#8722;N bond distances of 2.21&#8211;2.26&#8197;&#197; and N&#8722;I&#8722;N angles of 177&#8211;180&#176;, whilst some of the corresponding Ag+ complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N angles of ca. 150&#176; and Ag&#8722;N bond distances of 2.09&#8211;2.18&#8197;&#197;.

Abstract
Recently published syntheses, reactions and characterizations of unusual unsaturated ring strained Group 4 metallocene metallacycles like metalla&#8208;cyclocumulenes, &#8208;cycloallenes and &#8208;cycloalkynes with different ring size are updated for the last three years. There exist for some of these metallacycles, depending on the ring size, 7&#8208;, 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered compounds. The new results for these metallacycles are summarized here and considered in addition to the former published results. Additionally, several compounds of this type were now characterized by new reactions. For a better understanding of these compounds, some spectroscopical methods as well as theoretical calculations were published. Despite of these all&#8208;C&#8208;metallacycles, only in some cases the syntheses and reactions for the corresponding hetero&#8208;metallacycles were published too. Examples for these metallaheterocyclic compounds will not be considered in this article.

         <title>Water&#8208;Assisted Chemical Route Towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction at the Hydrated (110) Ruthenium Oxide Surface: Heterogeneous Catalysis via DFT&#8208;MD and Metadynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the hydrated (110)&#8208;RuO2 catalyst surface revealing a noticeable water&#8208;assisted reaction pathway where the explicit water environment acts as co&#8208;catalyst enhancing the OER.







Abstract
Notwithstanding that RuO2 is a promising catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a plethora of fundamental details on its catalytic properties are still elusive, severely limiting its large&#8208;scale deployment. It is also established experimentally that corrosion and wettability of metal oxides can, in fact, enhance the catalytic activity for OER owing to the formation of a hydrated surface layer. However, the mechanistic interplay between surface wettability, interfacial water dynamics and OER across RuO2, and what degree these processes are correlated are still debated. Herein, spin&#8208;polarized Density Functional Theory Molecular Dynamics (DFT&#8208;MD) simulations, coupled with advanced enhanced sampling methods in the well&#8208;tempered metadynamics framework, are applied to gain a global understanding of RuO2 aqueous interface (explicit water solvent) in catalyzing the OER, and hence possibly help in the design of novel catalysts in the context of photochemical water oxidation. The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the (110)&#8208;RuO2 catalyst surface revealing plausible pathways composing the reaction network of the O2 evolution. In particular, OER is investigated at room temperature when such a surface is exposed to both gas&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase water. Albeit a unique efficient pathway has been identified in the gas&#8208;phase OER, a surprisingly lowest&#8208;free&#8208;energy&#8208;requiring reaction route is possible when (110)&#8208;RuO2 is in contact with explicit liquid water. By estimating the free&#8208;energy surfaces associated to these processes, we reveal a noticeable water&#8208;assisted OER mechanism which involves a crucial proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;step assisted by the local water environment. These findings pave the way toward the systematic usage of DFT&#8208;MD coupled with metadynamics techniques for the fine assessment of the activity of catalysts, considering finite&#8208;temperature and explicit&#8208;solvent effects.

         <title>The E2 state of FeMoco: Hydride Formation versus Fe Reduction and a Mechanism for H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydride formation versus Fe reduction: Hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics calculations were used to explore the the E2 redox state of the iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase. Two stable isomers were found: a bridging hydride model (with an open belt sulfide&#8208;bridge) and a non&#8208;hydride model (with two belt sulfides protonated and reduced Fe). A path back to the resting state, by H2 evolution via a hydride&#8208;proton reaction was found.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is responsible for dinitrogen reduction in Mo nitrogenase. Unlike the resting state, E0, reduced states of FeMoco are much less well characterized. The E2 state has been proposed to contain a hydride but direct spectroscopic evidence is still lacking. The E2 state can, however, relax back the E0 state via a H2 side&#8208;reaction, implying a hydride intermediate prior to H2 formation. This E2&#8594;E0 pathway is one of the primary mechanisms for H2 formation under low&#8208;electron flux conditions. In this study we present an exploration of the energy surface of the E2 state. Utilizing both cluster&#8208;continuum and QM/MM calculations, we explore various classes of E2 models: including terminal hydrides, bridging hydrides with a closed or open sulfide&#8208;bridge, as well as models without. Importantly, we find the hemilability of a protonated belt&#8208;sulfide to strongly influence the stability of hydrides. Surprisingly, non&#8208;hydride models are found to be almost equally favorable as hydride models. While the cluster&#8208;continuum calculations suggest multiple possibilities, QM/MM suggests only two models as contenders for the E2 state. These models feature either i) a bridging hydride between Fe2 and Fe6 and an open sulfide&#8208;bridge (terminal SH on Fe6) (E2&#8208;hyd) or ii) a double belt&#8208;sulfide protonated, reduced cofactor without a hydride (E2&#8208;nonhyd). We suggest both models as contenders for the E2 redox state and further calculate a mechanism for H2 evolution. The changes in electronic structure of FeMoco during the proposed redox&#8208;state cycle, E0&#8594;E1&#8594;E2&#8594;E0, are discussed.

Utilizing both cluster-continuum and QM/MM calculations, we explore various classes of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; models: including terminal hydrides, bridging hydrides with a closed or open sulfide-bridge, as well as models without. Importantly, we find the hemilability of a protonated belt-sulfide to strongly influence the stability of hydrides. Surprisingly, non-hydride models are found to be almost equally favorable as hydride models. While the cluster-continuum calculations suggest multiple possibilities, QM/MM suggests only two models as contenders for the E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; state. These models feature either i) a bridging hydride between Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and an open sulfide-bridge (terminal SH on Fe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-hyd&lt;/b&gt;) or ii) a double belt-sulfide protonated, reduced cofactor without a hydride (&lt;b&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-nonhyd&lt;/b&gt;). We suggest both models as contenders for the E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox state and further calculate a mechanism for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. The changes in electronic structure of FeMoco during the proposed redox-state cycle, E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Photophysics and Photochemistry of Melanin&#8208; Like Nanomaterials Depend on Morphology and Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melanin&#8208;like materials can be easily prepared from simple precursors upon controlled oxidation/polymerization. In the resulting system, species with different structure and morphology coexist and interact. The overall photophysical and photochemical properties depend in part on the nature of the chromophores formed but also, to a large extent, on the interchromophoric interactions as typical for supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
Melanin&#8208;like nanomaterials have found application in a large variety of high economic and social impact fields as medicine, energy conversion and storage, photothermal catalysis and environmental remediation. These materials have been used mostly for their optical and electronic properties, but also for their high biocompatibility and simplicity and versatility of preparation. Beside this, their chemistry is complex and it yields structures with different molecular weight and composition ranging from oligomers, to polymers as well as nanoparticles (NP). The comprehension of the correlation of the different compositions and morphologies to the optical properties of melanin is still incomplete and challenging, even if it is fundamental also from a technological point of view. In this minireview we focus on scientific papers, mostly recent ones, that indeed examine the link between composition and structural feature and photophysical and photochemical properties proposing this approach as a general one for future research.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of on&#8208;surface synthesis provides a unique approach toward the formation of carbon&#8208;based nanostructures with designed properties. Herein, we present the on&#8208;surface formation of CN&#8208;substituted phenylene vinylene chains on the Au(111) surface, thermally induced by annealing the substrate stepwise at temperatures between 220&#176;C and 240&#176;C. The reaction is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory. Supported by the calculated reaction pathway, we assign the observed chain formation to a Knoevenagel condensation between an aldehyde and a methylene nitrile substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of protonated Schiff base excited state decay within visual protein mimics: a unified model for retinal chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial biomimetic chromophore&#8208;protein complexes inspired by natural visual pigments can feature color tunability across the full visible spectrum. However, control of excited state dynamics of the retinal chromophore, which is of paramount importance for technological applications, is lacking due to its complex and subtle photophysics/photochemistry. Here, we combine ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations for the study of highly&#8208;tunable rhodopsin mimics, as compared to retinal chromophores in solution. We identify conical intersections and transient fluorescent intermediates with atomistic resolution, providing unambiguous assignment of their ultrafast excited state absorption features. Our results point out that the electrostatic environment of the chromophore, modified by protein point mutations, affects its excited state properties allowing control of its photophysics with same power of chemical modifications of the chromophore. The complex nature of such fine control is a fundamental knowledge for the design of bio&#8208;mimetic opto&#8208;electronic and photonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Phosphoryl pyrazolones for highly selective lithium separation from alkali metal ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective receptors for the separation of Li + from a mixture with other alkali metal ions under mild conditions remains an important challenge that could benefit from new approaches. In this study, it is demonstrated that the 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones, H  L  2  &#8208;H  L  4  , in the presence of the typical industrial organophosphorus co&#8208;ligands tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), tributylphosphate (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), are able to selectively recognise and extract lithium ions from aqueous solution. Structural investigations in solution as well as in the solid state reveal the existence of a series of multinuclear Li  +  complexes that include dimers (TBPO, TBP) as well as rarely observed trimers (TOPO) and represent the first clear evidence for the synergistic role of the co&#8208;ligands in the extraction process. Our findings are supported by detailed NMR, MS and extraction studies. Liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in the presence of TOPO revealed an unprecedented high Li  +  extraction efficiency (78%) for H  L  4  compared to the use of the industrially employed acylpyrazolone H  L  1  (15%) and benzoyl&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroacetone (52%) extractants. In addition, a high selectivity for Li  +  over Na  +  , K  +  and Cs  +  under mild conditions (pH ~ 8.2) confirms that H  L  2  &#8208;H  L  4  represent a class of ligands that are very effective extractants for use in lithium separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Systems on the Surface of Functionalized Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) Utilizing Hamilton Receptors and Cyanurate Derivative Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of hydrogen bonding interactions at the level of functionalized nanoparticles remains highly challenging and poorly explored area. In this work, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were orthogonally functionalized using receptors bearing multiple hydrogen bonding motifs. Pristine SPIONs were modified by wet chemical processes with Hamilton receptors (hosts), or cyanurate&#8208;guest molecules linked to phosphonic acid moieties for monolayer functionalization. The modified surfaces were fully characterized and the number of attached ligands on the surface were determined. The host&#8208;guest interactions on the interface of modified SPIONs were investigated by using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titrations. Functionalized SPIONs demonstrated two to three magnitudes stronger binding affinities as compared to the related molecular interactions in solution due to synergistic effects on complex surface environment. Higher supramolecular binding ratios of host&#8208;guest interactions on the modified surface were emerged. These studies provide fundamental insights into supramolecular complexions on the surface at solid&#8208;liquid interface systems to have deeper understanding for applications in engineered nanomaterials, nano&#8208;sensing devices, and drug delivery systems, which utilize host&#8208;guest supramolecular chemistry interactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aliphatic &#947;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporated in place of their canonical analogues through cell&#8208;free protein synthesis act as heat&#8208;labile linkers, offering a useful strategy for the straightforward production of target peptides as fusion proteins, from which the targets are readily released. Until now, the natural abundance of aliphatic amino acids in peptides has limited the scope of the method, as it leads to undesired cleavage sites in synthesized products, but here we report the development of a new cleavable chloro amino acid that incorporates in place of the relatively rare amino acid methionine, thus greatly expanding the scope of producible targets. This new strategy is employed for simplified peptide synthesis with a methionine&#8208;free fusion partner, allowing single&#8208;site incorporation of the cleavable linker for clean release and easy purification of the target peptide. Its utility is demonstrated through the straightforward preparation of two peptides reported to be challenging targets and not accessible through standard solid&#8208;phase chemical methodologies, as well as analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lead Mixed Halide with Three Different Coordinated Anions and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are widely applied in information technology, micro&#8208;manufacturing and medical treatment. Herein, a new lead mixed halide with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 represents the rare NLO crystal featuring that three different anions (I&#8208;, Br&#8208; and O2&#8208;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom to form a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron with a large polarizability. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 not only exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching SHG response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), but also possesses a large birefringence (0.27@1064nm) and high laser damage threshold (LDT). The strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains. This study points out an effective strategy to develop new NLO crystals with strong SHG response.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Iron Doping and Cyano Groups for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production over C3N4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the insufficient  carrier separation  dynamics is still of significant in  carbon  nitride (C  3  N  4  )  research  . Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the  synergistic enhancement  effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group&#8208;containing Fe&#8208;doped C  3  N  4  porous materials via direct co&#8208;calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine  for  synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation  of cyano groups and form Fe&#8208;doping  in C  3  N  4  , thereby increasing the visible&#8208;light absorption and reactive sites.  Further, the internal donor&#8208;acceptor  system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e  &#8208;  &#8208;h  +  pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C  3  N  4  (BCN).</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Design Principle of Near&#8208;Infrared Upconversion Sensitizer Based on Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Organic Dye for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upconversion luminescent (UCL) triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) affords superior outcome for cancer treatment. However, conventional UCL materials which all work as multiphoton absorption (MPA) process, inevitably need extremely high power density far over the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to laser. Here, an one&#8208;photon absorption molecular upconversion sensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br based on frequency upconversion luminescent (FUCL) is designed for PDT. The unusual super heavy atom effect (SHAE) in Cy5.5&#8208;Br strongly enhance its spin&#8208;orbit coupling (0.23 cm&#8208;1), triplet quantum yield (11.1%) and triplet state lifetime (18.8 &#956;s) while the potential hot&#8208;band absoption of Cy5.5&#8208;Br are well maintained. Importantly, Cy5.5&#8208;Br can efficiently target to the tumour site and kill cancer cells by destroying mitochondria under a biosafety MPE to 808 nm laser. The photostability and antitumor results are obviously superior to that of Stoke process. This work first provide a design criterion for FUCL dyes to realize effective PDT upon a biosafety optical density, possibly being more clinical benefits than conventional MPA materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Graphene&#8217;s excellent electrical conductivity benefits from its highly&#8208;conjugated structure. Therefore, the manipulation of graphene&#8217;s electronic and mechanical properties can be realized by controlled destruction of its in&#8208;sheet conjugation system. Herein, we report the preparation of CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at molecular level. In detail, sodium alginate was compounded with Co  2+  and Ce  3+  , the composite was loaded onto graphene. The graphene sheets are propped by bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid the re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets allow the creation of nanometer&#8208;sized space between them. The BPMW have 33.2&#176; angle between coplanar pyrene group and benzene groups, graphene layers were propped in tilt direction. Finally, the three&#8208;dimensional porous composite was obtained after annealing and vulcanization. The resulting CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO shows excellent electrical conductivity and remarkable cycle stability, and high specific capacitance of 1004 F g  &#8208;1  when the current density is 1 A g  &#8208;1  . The excellent electrochemical performance should benefit from the modification of graphene by BPMW via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions and synergistic effect resulted from the special structure. Moreover, a solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor device is fabricated based on the synthesized CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid, and exhibits a power density of 979 W kg  &#8208;1  at the energy density of 23.96 W h kg  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic(thio)ethers is reported via a simple strategy relying on carbon&#8208;chalcogen bond activation with difluorocarbene. The reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ protonation of the previously little&#8208;known difluoromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylide intermediate followed by ring&#8208;opening with halide ion to afford halogenated acyclic difluoromethyl (thio)ethers that can then be employed for further elaboration. TMSCF2X (X = Br, Cl) are unique reagents to achieve this synthetic purpose, which serve as both the difluorocarbene source and the halide ion source.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal alkynes have been used in combination with tosylamides and the Narasaka leaving group to form tetra(hetero)substituted enamines in an aminopalladation cascade reaction. The cascade was terminated either intramolecularly by a Heck reaction or intermolecularly in a Suzuki&#8208;type reaction with a boronic acid.







Abstract
Alkyne aminopalladation reactions starting from tosylamides are reported. The emerging vinylic Pd species are converted either in an intramolecular Heck reaction with olefinic units or in an intermolecular Suzuki reaction by using boronic acids exhibiting broad functional group tolerance. Tetra(hetero)substituted tosylated enamines are obtained in a simple one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy and Electronic Structure of Mono&#8208;and Dinuclear Pyridyl&#8208;Triazole/DPEPhos&#8208;Based Cu(I) Complexes</title>

The comprehensive results on two mononuclear pyridyl&#8208;triazole/DPEPhos based Cu(I) complexes and its extension to their two dinuclear analogues paves the road to addressing the complex coupling of the respective monomeric units, involving various physical and chemical properties as charge, (electronic) structure and (long&#8208;lived) excited state properties, relevant for applications.







Abstract
Chemical and spectroscopic characterization of the mononuclear photosensitizers [(DPEPhos)Cu(I)(MPyrT)]0/+ (CuL, CuLH) and their dinuclear analogues (Cu2L&#8217;, Cu2L'H2), backed by (TD)DFT and high&#8208;level GW&#8208;Bethe&#8208;Salpeter equation calculations, exemplifies the complex influence of charge, nuclearity and structural flexibility on UV&#8208;induced photophysical pathways. Ultrafast transient absorption and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy reveal flattening distortion in the triplet state of CuLH as controlled by charge, which also appears to have a large impact on the symmetry of the long&#8208;lived triplet states in Cu2L&#8217; and Cu2L'H2. Time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy (solid state), supported by transient photodissociation spectroscopy (gas phase), confirm a lifetime of some tens of &#956;s for the respective triplet states, as well as the energetics of thermally activated delayed luminescence, both being essential parameters for application of these materials based on earth&#8208;abundant copper in photocatalysis and luminescent devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Prospect and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in cold regions and seasons is limited seriously due to the decreased Li+ transportation capability and sudden decline in performance. Here, an insightful viewpoint on the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) effect is given and a new insight about the Li+ solvation structure to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte design more effectively is presented.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein, we summarize the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Then, we also introduce the recent new insight about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Cyclohexene Oxidation with O2 over Spray&#8208;Flame&#8208;Synthesized La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 Perovskite Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
A complex for a complex reaction: La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8208;flame synthesis and applied in the liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene with molecular O2. An optimum Sr doping of 20&#8197;at.&#8201;% &#8211; with balanced amounts of oxygen vacancies and Co2+ cations &#8211; was found to be beneficial for cyclohexene conversion. In situ ATR&#8208;IR and EPR spectroscopy verified the complex radical reaction network.







Abstract
La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8208;flame synthesis and applied in the liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene with molecular O2 as oxidant under mild conditions. The catalysts were systematically characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques. With increasing Sr content, the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects increases, which is beneficial for cyclohexene oxidation, but the surface concentration of less active Co2+ was also increased. However, Co2+ cations have a superior activity towards peroxide decomposition, which also plays an important role in cyclohexene oxidation. A Sr doping of 20 at.&#8201;% was found to be the optimum in terms of activity and product selectivity. The catalyst also showed excellent reusability over three catalytic runs; this can be attributed to its highly stable particle size and morphology. Kinetic investigations revealed first&#8208;order reaction kinetics for temperatures between 60 and 100&#8201;&#176;C and an apparent activation energy of 68&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the reaction was not affected by the applied O2 pressure in the range from 10 to 20&#8197;bar. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion of cyclohexene and the formation of reaction products including the key intermediate cyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;hydroperoxide; spin trap electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided strong evidence for a radical reaction pathway by identifying the cyclohexenyl alkoxyl radical.

         <title>Terminal Ligand and Packing Effects on Slow Relaxation in an Isostructural Set of [Dy(H2dapp)X2]+ Single Molecule Magnets**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new dysprosium complexes with a pentadentate ligand occupying five equatorial sites differ only in the nature of the axial ligands. These help tune the relaxation properties as judged by an analysis of the AC susceptibility data. More in depth analysis by using two recently suggested fitting equations lead to similar outcomes for all three systems. As a further contribution to the relaxation pathway involving the phonon bath it is concluded that a short nitrate&#8208;nitrate interaction between molecules helps dampen the spin phonon coupling.







Abstract
We report three structurally related single ion Dy compounds using the pentadentate ligand 2,6&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;hydrazineylidene)ethyl)pyridine (H2dapp) [Dy(H2dapp)(NO3)2]NO3 (1), [Dy(H2dapp)(OAc)2]Cl (2) and [Dy(H2dapp)(NO3)2]Cl0.92(NO3)0.08 (3). The (H2dapp) occupies a helical twisted pentagonal equatorial arrangement with two anionic ligands in the axial positions. Further influence on the electronic and magnetic structure is provided by a closely associated counterion interacting with the central N&#8722;H group of the (H2dapp). The slow relaxation of the magnetisation shows that the anionic acetates give the greatest slowing down of the magnetisation reversal. Further influence on the relaxation properties of compounds1 and 2 is the presence of short nitrate&#8208;nitrate intermolecular ligand contact opening further lattice relaxation pathways.

&lt;p&gt;We report three structurally related single ion Dy compounds using the pentadentate ligand 2,6-bis((&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-1-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)-hydrazineylidene)ethyl)pyridine (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dapp) [Dy(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dapp)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [Dy(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dapp)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and [Dy(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dapp)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dapp) occupies a helical twisted pentagonal equatorial arrangement with two anionic ligands in the axial positions. Further influence on the electronic and magnetic structure is provided by a closely associated counterion interacting with the central N&#8722;H group of the (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dapp). The slow relaxation of the magnetisation shows that the anionic acetates give the greatest slowing down of the magnetisation reversal. Further influence on the relaxation properties of compounds&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is the presence of short nitrate-nitrate intermolecular ligand contact opening further lattice relaxation pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Field Induced Mass Transfer: New Insight into Nano&#8208;electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocatalysts proves to be a promising way of promoting the performance of electrocatalytic reactions. In this Concept, we provide a brief review of the recent progress of new physics in nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, that is, local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer (LMT), and highlight new insights into LMT in the future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Unravelling the complex kinetics of electrocatalysis is essential for the design of electrocatalysts with high performance. Mass transfer and electron transfer are two primary factors that need to be optimized in order to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. The use of nanocatalysts proves to be a promising way of promoting the performance of electrocatalytic reactions, this improvement is usually attributed to their ability to enhance electron transfer. However, when catalysts are taken down to the nanoscale, their size is comparable to the thickness of an electrical double layer, so any curvature can lead to an inhomogeneous local electric field on the electrode, which then changes the mass transfer essentially. In this article, we introduce the new concept of local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer in nano&#8208;electrocatalytic systems, and provide a brief review of recent progress, revealing its effect on nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, which may bring new insight into the future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.

         <title>Rigid, Highly Reactive and Stable DOTA&#8208;like Tags Containing a Thiol&#8208;Specific Phenylsulfonyl Pyridine Moiety for Protein Modification and NMR Analysis**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a meta&#8208;Br in pyridine greatly enhances the reactivity of the phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety towards the free thiol group in a protein, which makes the protein ligation reaction completed within a couple of hours under physiological conditions. The high performance of these phenylsulfonyl pyridine tags in site&#8208;specific labeling of proteins have been demonstrated in a number of proteins.Rigid, Highly Reactive and Stable DOTA&#8208;like Tags Containing a Thiol&#8208;Specific Phenylsulfonyl Pyridine Moiety for Protein Modification and NMR Analysis (Su et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Site specific installation of a paramagnetic ion with magnetic anisotropy in a biomolecule generates valuable structural restraints, such as pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). These paramagnetic effects can be used to characterize the structures, interactions and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their complexes. Two single&#8208;armed DOTA&#8208;like tags, BrPSPy&#8208;DO3M(S)A&#8208;Ln and BrPSPy&#8208;6M&#8208;DO3M(S)A&#8208;Ln, each containing a thiol&#8208;specific reacting group, that is, a phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety, are demonstrated as rigid, reactive and stable paramagnetic tags for protein modification by formation of a reducing resistant thioether bond between the protein and the tag. The two tags present high reactivity with the solvent exposed thiol group in aqueous solution at room temperature. The introduction of Br at the meta&#8208;position in pyridine enhances the reactivity of 4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl pyridine towards the solvent exposed thiol group in a protein, whereas the ortho&#8208;methyl group in pyridine increases the rigidity of the tag in the protein conjugates. The high performance of these two tags has been demonstrated in different cysteine mutants of ubiquitin and GB1. The high reactivity and rigidity of these two tags can be added in the toolbox of paramagnetic tags suitable for the high&#8208;resolution NMR measurements of biological macromolecules and their complexes.

         <title>Engineering of Silicon Core&#8208;Shell Structures for Li&#8208;ion Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8208;shell architecture has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to enable higher silicon content in Li&#8208;ion anodes. In this review, we report different types of coatings on silicon particles including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer shells from some selected examples. The synthesis methods, structure characterization, main properties and resulting electrochemical performance are outlined. Improvements over silicon are decrypted and trends for future works are objectively identified.







Abstract
The amount of silicon in anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries is still limited by the huge volume changes during charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Such changes lead to the loss of electrical contacts, as well as mechanical and surface electrolyte interphase (SEI) instabilities, strongly reducing the cycle life. Core&#8208;shell structures have attracted a vast research interest due to the possibility of modifying some properties with a judicious choice of the shell. It is, for example, possible to improve the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion, or buffer volume variations. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the recent developments and the different strategies used for the design, synthesis and electrochemical performance of silicon&#8208;based core&#8208;shells. It is based on a selection of the main types of silicon coatings reported in the literature, including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer coatings, Finally, a summary of the advantages and drawbacks of these different types of core&#8208;shells as anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries and some insightful suggestions in regards to their use are provided.

         <title>Perfluorinated Trialkoxysilanol with Dramatically Increased Br&#248;nsted Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine makes the difference: The Br&#248;nsted acidity of tris&#8208;(tert&#8208;butoxy)silanol dramatically increases when the substituents are decorated by 27 fluorine atoms.







Abstract
The Br&#248;nsted acidity of the perfluorinated trialkoxysilanol {(F3C)3CO}3SiOH is more than 13 orders of magnitude higher than that of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)4, and even more for most previously known silanols. It is easily deprotonated by simple amines and pyridines to give the conjugate silanolates [OSi{OC(CF3)3}3]&#8722;, which possess extremely short Si&#8722;O bonds, comparable to those of silanones.

         <title>Giant Shape&#8208;Persistent Tetrahedral Porphyrin System: Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant multichromophore: A tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent supramolecular structure has been fully characterised in the solid state (by X&#8208;ray diffraction) and in solution (by NMR, electrochemical and photophysical analysis). Excitation of either the scaffold (blue in the image) or the peripheral ruthenium porphyrins results in an ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer from the ruthenium porphyrins to the scaffold.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giant multichromophore&lt;/b&gt;: A tetrahedral shape-persistent supramolecular structure has been fully characterised in the solid state (by X-ray diffraction) and in solution (by NMR, electrochemical and photophysical analysis). Excitation of either the scaffold (blue in the image) or the peripheral ruthenium porphyrins results in an ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer from the ruthenium porphyrins to the scaffold.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetraphenylmethane appended with four pyridylpyridinium units works as a scaffold to self-assemble four ruthenium porphyrins in a tetrahedral shape-persistent giant architecture. The resulting supramolecular structure has been characterised in the solid state by X-ray single crystal analysis and in solution by various techniques. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirms the 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 stoichiometry with the formation of a highly symmetric structure. The self-assembly process can be monitored by changes of the redox potentials, as well as by modifications in the visible absorption spectrum of the ruthenium porphyrin and by a complete quenching of both the bright fluorescence of the tetracationic scaffold and the weak phosphorescence of the ruthenium porphyrin. An ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer is responsible for this quenching process.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a systematic study of halogenate(I/III) anions with polyatomic ligands. The bis(perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I) [X(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  , X = Cl, Br, I, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are prepared as their tetraethylammonium salts and characterized with IR, Raman and NMR spectroscopic methods as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Spectroscopical data are supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Additionally, the bonding situation of the species in question are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, we studied the oxidation to the corresponding halogenate(III) derivatives. For [Br(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  oxidation with elemental fluorine yielded [BrF  2  (OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  . Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC  4  F  9  to the I  III  species [I(OC  4  F  9  )  4  ]  &#8722;  which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future.

         <title>Saturated Boronic Acids, Boronates, and Trifluoroborates: An Update on Their Synthetic and Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organoboron compounds. The chemistry of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates is reviewed. Applications of the title compounds in the design of boron&#8208;containing drugs and as tools to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bonds are discussed. The current state of the art in the synthesis of saturated boronic derivatives is described, with a special focus on methodologies developed over the last decade.







Abstract
This review discusses recent advances in the chemistry of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates. Applications of the title compounds in the design of boron&#8208;containing drugs are surveyed, with special emphasis on &#945;&#8208;amino boronic derivatives. A general overview of saturated boronic compounds as modern tools to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bonds is given, including recent developments in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;couplings, single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes including metallo&#8208; and organocatalytic photoredox reactions, and transformations of boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes. Finally, an attempt to summarize the current state of the art in the synthesis of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates is made, with a brief mention of the &#8220;classical&#8221; methods (transmetallation of organolithium/magnesium reagents with boron species, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes, and the modification of alkenyl boron compounds) and a special focus on recent methodologies (boronation of alkyl (pseudo)halides, derivatives of carboxylic acids, alcohols, and primary amines, boronative C&#8722;H activation, novel approaches to alkene hydroboration, and 1,2&#8208;metallate&#8208;type rearrangements).

         <title>A Series of Iron(II)&#8208;NHC Sensitizers with Remarkable Power Conversion Efficiency in Photoelectrochemical Cells**
</title>

A Fe(II)NHC sensitizer bearing a dimethoxyphenyl group on the ancillary ligand scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron&#8208;sensitized solar cell (1.83&#8201;%) using Mg2+ and NBu4I&#8208;based electrolyte and a thick 20&#8197;&#956;m TiO2 anode.







Abstract
A series of six new Fe(II)NHC&#8208;carboxylic sensitizers with their ancillary ligand decorated with functions of varied electronic properties have been designed with the aim to increase the metal&#8208;to&#8208; surface charge separation and light harvesting in iron&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). ARM130 scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron&#8208;sensitized solar cell (1.83&#8201;%) using Mg2+ and NBu4I&#8208;based electrolyte and a thick 20&#8197;&#956;m TiO2 anode. Computational modelling, transient absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the electronic properties induced by the dimethoxyphenyl&#8208;substituted NHC ligand of ARM130 led to the best combination of electron injection yield and spectral sensitivity breadth.

An asymmetric rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond addition to aldimines followed by subsequent intramolecular cyclization to form chiral isoindolinones has been achieved by using a chiral directing group. Various substituted benzamides and aldimines have been smoothly transformed to the corresponding products in up to 68&#8201;% yield with up to 93&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
By using a chiral directing group, an asymmetric rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond addition to aldimines followed by intramolecular cyclization to form chiral isoindolinones has been achieved (up to 68&#8201;% yield, up to 93&#8201;%&#8201;ee). A three&#8208;component variant that resembles Mannich reaction was also realized (41&#8201;% yield, 83&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Product elaborations and preliminary mechanistic studies were described.

Designer Ligand: Cyclophanyl (hetero)bimetal complexes with a focus on Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal distance modulation by bridging ligand design are highlighted. Employing the co&#8208;facially stacked cyclophanyl&#8208;derived pseudo&#8208;geminal, &#8208;ortho, &#8208;meta, and &#8208;para constitutional isomers grafted with N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and P&#8208; containing chelates allow the installation of diverse (hetero)metallic moieties in a distance&#8208;defined and spatially&#8208;oriented relation that are crucial factors, contribute to the tuning of structure&#8208;property relation and cooperative effects in catalysis as well as emerging material applications.







Abstract
Multinuclear metal complexes have seen tremendous progress in synthetic advances, their versatile structural features, and emerging applications. Here, we conceptualize Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal distance modulation in cyclophanyl metal complexes by bridging ligand design employing the co&#8208;facially stacked cyclophanyl&#8208;derived pseudo&#8208;geminal, &#8208;ortho, &#8208;meta, and &#8208;para constitutional isomers grafted with N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and P&#8208; containing chelates that allow the installation of diverse (hetero)metallic moieties in a distance&#8208;defined and spatially&#8208;oriented relation to one another. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal distance modulation and innate transannular &#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221; &#960;&#8211;&#960; electronic interactions via the co&#8208;facially stacked benzene rings in cyclophanyl&#8208;derived complexes as well as their specific stereochemical structural features (element of planar chirality) are crucial factors that contribute to the tuning of structure&#8208;property relationships, which stand at the very center from the perspective of cooperative effects in catalysis as well as emerging material applications.

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, notable works on adjusting optical force probes in their responses to energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution have been published and help unraveling the macroscopic with relation to the molecular mechanical properties of polymer materials. Here, notable examples that put a dent in the universe of optical force sensing are highlighted.







Abstract
The correlation of mechanical properties of polymer materials with those of their molecular constituents is the foundation for their holistic comprehension and eventually for improved material designs and syntheses. Over the last decade, optical force probes (OFPs) were developed, shedding light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials. The properties of polymers are diverse, ranging from soft hydrogels to ultra&#8208;tough composites, from purely elastic rubbers to viscous colloidal solutions, and from transparent glasses to super black dyed coatings. Only very recently, researchers started to develop tailored OFP solutions that account for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. We here highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.

         <title>A Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metals and oxides are two important types of heterogeneous catalysts applied in selective alcohol oxidation under thermal, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conditions. Considering the intrinsic differences in these methods, different approaches exist to prepare the catalysts and study them under such reaction conditions. In this minireview, important advances and the remaining challenges for more in&#8208;depth characterization of the above&#8208;mentioned catalysts are described to provide a perspective for future works in the field of selective alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of higher alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is an important reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals with added value. Though the process for primary alcohol oxidation is industrially established, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding considering the complexity of the catalysts and their dynamics under reaction conditions, especially when higher alcohols and liquid&#8208;phase reaction media are involved. Additionally, new materials should be developed offering higher activity, selectivity, and stability. This can be achieved by unraveling the structure&#8211;performance correlations of these catalysts under reaction conditions. In this regard, researchers are encouraged to develop more advanced characterization techniques to address the complex interplay between the solid surface, the dissolved reactants, and the solvent. In this mini&#8208;review, we report some of the most important approaches taken in the field and give a perspective on how to tackle the complex challenges for different approaches in alcohol oxidation while providing insight into the remaining challenges.

         <title>Early Physical Organic Chemistry: Nikolai Aleksandrovich Menshutkin (1842&#8211;1907) and Reaction Velocities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forgotten history: Nikolai Aleksandrovich Menshutkin was a multifaceted chemist who systematically applied kinetics to the study of the effects of reactant structure on the rate of esterification of alcohols with carboxylic acids, and the quaternization of amines with alkylhalides. These last reactions gave evidence of an element effect and dramatic solvent effects.







Abstract
The name of Menshutkin is most frequently associated with his eponymous reaction (the quaternization of tertiary amines with alkyl halides). However, he made encyclopedic contributions to the field of reaction kinetics, where he carried out extensive studies of the effects of reactant structure on the rates of esterification of monohydric, dihydric and trihydric alcohols with monocarboxylic acids, and monobasic and dibasic carboxylic acids and anhydrides with monohydric alcohols. In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide&#8208;ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exotic physical properties are often exhibited by compounds crystallizing in the ubiquitous ThCr2Si2 structure type illustrated in the picture. A plethora of metal tetrahydrides belonging to this family, with metal cations, H&#8208; and quasimolecular H2 units, have been synthesized in diamond anvil cells and/or predicted to be stable under pressure. A theoretical investigation unveils why some are superconducting, whereas others are not. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Bi and E. Zurek (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102679).

         <title>Synergistic Peptide and Gold Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Branched Aldehydes to Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a tripeptide and a gold complex catalyzes the enantioselective addition between branched aldehydes and allenamides to furnish synthetically versatile &#947;,&#948;&#8208;enamide aldehydes with a fully substituted stereogenic center. Mechanistic studies offered key insights into the role of the peptide and acid/base additives.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The combination of a peptide catalyst and a gold catalyst is presented for enantioselective addition reactions between branched aldehydes and allenamides. The two catalysts act in concert to provide &#947;,&#948;-enamide aldehydes bearing a fully substituted, benzylic stereogenic center &#8211; a structural motif common in many natural products and therapeutically active compounds &#8211; with good yields and enantioselectivities. The reaction tolerates a variety of alkyl and alkoxy substituted aldehydes and the products can be elaborated into several chiral building blocks bearing either 1,4- or 1,5- functional group relationships. Mechanistic studies showed that the conformational features of the peptide are important for both the catalytic efficiency and stereochemistry, while a balance of acid/base additives is key for ensuring formation of the desired product over undesired side reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergy of Bi2O3 and RuO2 nanocatalysts for low&#8208;overpotential and wide pH&#8208;window electrochemical ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is still seriously impeded by the inferior NH3  yield and low Faradic efficiency, especially at low overpotentials. Herein, we report the synthesis of nano&#8208;sized RuO2  and Bi2O3  particles grown on functionalized exfoliated graphene (FEG) through in&#8208;situ electrodeposition, denoted as RuO2&#8208;Bi2O3/FEG. The prepared self&#8208;supporting RuO2&#8208;Bi2O3/FEG hybrid with a Bi mass loading of 0.70 wt% and Ru mass loading of 0.04 wt% shows excellent NRR performance at low overpotentials in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes. It achieves a large NH  3  yield of 4.58 &#177; 0.16 &#956;gNH3h&#8208;1cm&#8208;2  with a high Faradaic efficiency of 14.6% at &#8208;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4  electrolyte. This performance benefits from the synergistic effect between Bi2O3  and RuO2  which respectively have a fairly strong interaction of Bi 6p orbitals with the N 2p band and abundant supply of *H, as well as the binder&#8208;free characteristic and the convenient electron transfer via graphene nanosheets. This work highlights a new electrocatalyst design strategy that combines transition and main&#8208;group metal elements, which may provide some inspirations for designing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance NRR electrocatalysts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aqueous Neptunium(III) Halide Solvates from NpO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two Np (III) halides, NpI 3 (THF) 4 and NpBr 3 (THF) 4 , have been prepared and isolated in high yields as described in this work. Starting with neptunia (NpO 2 ), NpCl 4 (DME) 2 was first generated in an updated, higher yielding synthesis than what was previously reported using HCl/HF. This material was then reduced with KC 8 , followed by subsequent ligand exchange, to generate NpBr 3 (THF) 4 and NpI 3 &#8208;(THF) 4 . Full characterization by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1 H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the molecular formulas and oxidation states. These trivalent materials are straightforward to synthesize and can be used as starting materials for non&#8208;aqueous Np(III) chemistry, obviating the need for rare and restricted Np metal and elemental halogens.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD&#8208;containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several urea&#8208;inserted organo&#8208;polyoxometalates (POMs) derived from polyoxotungstovanadate [P  2  V  3  W  15  O  61  ]  9&#8211;  were prepared. The insertion of the carbonyl into the polyoxometallic framework activates the urea toward Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis. This was shown on the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of  trans  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Modelling shows that the most stable form of the organo&#8208;POMs features a  cis&#8208;trans  arrangement of the two N&#8211;H bonds, but that the likely catalytically active  trans&#8208;trans  form is accessible at room temperature. Finally, it is possible that the oxo substituents next to the vanadium atoms may help the approach of the nucleophile via H&#8208;bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow via Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of room&#8208;temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials, as well as the transformation of their photophysical properties, has emerged as an important topic in the research field of luminescent materials. Here we report the establishment of energy landscape in dopant&#8208;matrix organic afterglow systems where the aggregation states of luminescent dopants can be controlled by doping concentrations in the matrices and the material preparation methods. Through the manipulation via thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic stable aggregation state of the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials have been found to lead to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation behaviors triggered by thermal and solvent annealing.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of room-temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials, as well as the transformation of their photophysical properties, has emerged as an important topic in the research field of luminescent materials. Here we report the establishment of energy landscape in dopant-matrix organic afterglow systems where the aggregation states of luminescent dopants can be controlled by doping concentrations in the matrices and the material preparation methods. Through the manipulation via thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant-matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic stable aggregation state of the dopant-matrix afterglow materials have been found to lead to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation behaviors triggered by thermal and solvent annealing. The reversible afterglow transformation process that is thermodynamically unfavorable can also be achieved by coupling the dopant-matrix afterglow system to mechanical forces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Transformations of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review considered recent progress and achievements in the synthesis and transformation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines. The development of strategies for direct and selective preparation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines, even in enantioenriched form or by using sustainable approaches and continuous flow synthesis, are reported. Transformations of sulfoximines by N&#8722;S, N&#8722;P, N&#8722;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions are also covered.







Abstract
Recent years have seen a marked increase in the occurrence of sulfoximines in the chemical sciences, often presented as valuable motifs for medicinal chemistry. This has been prompted by both pioneering works taking sulfoximine containing compounds into clinical trials and the concurrent development of powerful synthetic methods. This review covers recent developments in the synthesis of sulfoximines concentrating on developments since 2015. This includes extensive developments in both S&#8722;N and S&#8722;C bond formations. Flow chemistry processes for sulfoximine synthesis are also covered. Finally, subsequent transformations of sulfoximines, particularly in N&#8208;functionalization are reviewed, including N&#8722;S, N&#8722;P, N&#8722;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions.

         <title>Elucidating Inner Workings of Naturally Sourced Organic Optoelectronic Materials with Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic optoelectronics: Naturally sourced organic chromophores with photosensitivity have enabled a variety of sustainable optoelectronics for light harvesting, transistors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes with broad societal benefits. To facilitate the rational design, ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy provides a powerful toolset to gain fundamental insights into the working mechanisms of these organic &#8220;molecular machines&#8221; from solution to thin films, aiming to improve the relevant device performance.







Abstract
Recent advances in sustainable optoelectronics including photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, transistors, and semiconductors have been enabled by &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules. A fundamental understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions involving these materials can be realized by time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies. In this Minireview, the photoinduced mechanisms including charge/energy transfer, electronic (de)localization, and excited&#8208;state proton transfer are correlated with functional properties encompassing optical absorption, fluorescence quantum yield, conductivity, and photostability. Four naturally derived molecules (xylindein, dimethylxylindein, alizarin, indigo) with ultrafast spectral insights showcase efficient energy dissipation involving H&#8208;bonding networks and proton motions, which yield high photostability. Rational design principles derived from such investigations could increase the efficiency for light harvesting, triplet formation, and photosensitivity for improved and versatile optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Redox Isomerization/(3+2) Allenoate Annulation by Auto&#8208;Tandem Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis allows a single catalyst to engage in two mechanistically distinct catalytic processes. While such approaches using transition metal catalysts are developed, they are less so in the field of organocatalysis. The use of a single phosphine catalyst is reported that mediates the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to give imines which then undergo (3+2) annulation with a range of allenoates in a second phosphine catalyzed process. Computational studies indicate that pivotal to the success of this reaction is the use of catalysts with similar ability to add to both allenoate and crotonate.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed approach to pyrrolines has been developed that involves two mechanistically unlinked catalytic processes. The first involves the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to provide access to aliphatic tosyl imines, which then engage in a (3+2) annulation with various allenoates. The reaction shows generality, with 24 examples established, along with a low yielding and moderately enantioselective variant. Mechanistic studies indicate that the viability of the process is linked to the selection of catalysts with similar propensity to add to the two coupling partners.

         <title>Stepwise Increase of NdIII&#8208;Based Phosphorescence by AIE&#8208;Active Sensitizer: Broadening the AIPE Family from Transition Metals to Discrete Near&#8208;Infrared Lanthanide Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With help of antenna effect, the excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers are enhanced while transferring into the inert NdIII excited state through 3LMCT. Further beneficial from the structural rigidification, AIE&#8208;active L as sensitizers possessed matched energy to NdIII, less non&#8208;radiative process, and low excitation window by twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thus affording the first AIPE&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes with the longest lifetimes among NdIII&#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
We designed two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lanthanide complexes [(L)2&#8208;Nd(NO3)3] (L=TPE2&#8208;BPY for 1, TPE&#8208;BPY for 2) by employing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives as sensitizers, which possessed matched energy to NdIII, prevented competitive deactivation under aggregation, even shifted the excitation window toward 600&#8197;nm by twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Furthermore, benefiting from the 4&#8201;f electron shielding effect and antenna effect, the enhanced excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers by structural rigidification transferred into the inert NdIII excited state through 3LMCT, affording the first aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes. As 1 equipped with more AIE&#8208;active TPE than 2, L&#8594;Nd energy transfer efficiency in the former was higher than that in the latter under the same conditions. Consequently, the crystal of 1 exhibited one of the longest lifetimes (9.69&#8197;&#956;s) among NdIII&#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>The Role of Common Alcoholic Sacrificial Agents in Photocatalysis: Is It Always Trivial?</title>

Making sacrifices: A good sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is not only determined by its rate of reaction with the holes, but also by the nature of products that can compete with the desired catalytic reaction and reduce its efficiency.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is proposed as a sustainable energy source. Simultaneous reduction and oxidation of water is a complex multistep reaction with high overpotential. Photocatalytic processes involving semiconductors transfer electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Sacrificial substrates that react with the photochemically formed holes in the valence band are often used to study the mechanism of H2 production, as they scavenge the holes and hinder charge carrier recombination (electron&#8208;hole pairs). Here, we show that the desired sacrificial agent is one forming a radical that is a fairly strong reducing agent, and whose oxidized form is not a good electron acceptor that might suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In an acidic medium, methanol was found to fulfill both these requirements better than ethanol and propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol in the TiO2&#8208;(M0&#8208;NPs) (M=Au or Pt) system, whereas in an alkaline medium, the alcohols exhibit a reverse order of activity. Moreover, we report that CH2(OH)2 is by far the most efficient sacrificial agent in a nontrivial mechanism in acidic media. Our study provides general guidelines for choosing an appropriate sacrificial substrate and helps to explain the variance in the performance of alcohol scavenger&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric and dimeric organocatalysts behave differently: Aldol and Michael reactions catalysed by &#947;&#8208;dipeptides derived from densely substituted unnatural proline derivatives show different behaviours. In aldol reactions an additive scheme is observed, whereas in conjugate reactions the catalytic activity of these dipeptides constitutes an emergent property. Experimental, kinetic and computational studies are reported to understand these phenomena.







Abstract
Different densely substituted L&#8208; and D&#8208;proline esters were prepared by asymmetric (3+2) cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by conveniently selected EhuPhos chiral ligands. The &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl pyrrolidines thus obtained in either their endo or exo forms were functionalized and coupled to yield the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. The catalytic properties of these latter dimers were examined using aldol and conjugate additions as case studies. When aldol reactions were analyzed, an additive behavior in terms of stereocontrol was observed on going from the monomers to the dimers. In contrast, in the case of the conjugate additions between ketones and nitroalkenes, the monomers did not catalyze this reaction, whereas the different &#947;&#8208;dipeptides promoted the formation of the corresponding Michael adducts. Therefore, in this latter case emergent catalytic properties were observed for these novel &#947;&#8208;dipeptides based on unnatural proline derivatives. Under certain conditions stoichiometric amounts of ketone, acid and nitroalkene), formation of N&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxooctahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles was observed.

         <title>Achieving Enhanced Photochromic Properties of Diarylethene through Host&#8208;Guest Interaction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of CB[n] host, the photophysical and photochemical properties of diarylethene derivatives (DTEs) were significantly affected. With suitable CB[n], DTEs showed faster response rate, better fatigue resistance, and higher fluorescence quenching ratio, suggesting that high&#8208;performance photochromic system in aqueous solution can be constructed through CB[n]&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interactions.







Abstract
Diarylethene (DTE) has been widely used in fluorescence probes, molecular logic gates, optical data&#8208;storage devices owing to the excellent photochromic property, while constructing high&#8208;performance photochromic DTE in aqueous media remains a big challenge. Herein we present several host&#8208;guest systems formed between cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n], n=7, 8, 10) and two water&#8208;soluble DTE derivatives 1 and 2. It was found that host&#8208;guest interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of photochromic guests, but also make great differences on the photoreaction process. Different host&#8208;guest binding behaviors also lead to different effects on the photochromic properties of guests. In the presence of CB[n], both 1 and 2 showed enhanced emission and higher fluorescence quenching ratio at photostationary state. Besides, CB[10]&#8901;1 exhibited faster response rate in cyclization reaction and better photofatigue resistance than free 1 in aqueous solution, while the supramolecular assembly of (CB[8])n&#8901;(2)n showed slower response rate in both directions of the reversible photoreaction. Besides, the photofatigue resistance of 2 can be greatly improved through binding with CB[7]. Our results suggest that host&#8208;guest interactions could be an efficient way to improve photochromic properties of DTE in aqueous solution.

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene (C60) Microstructures Featuring Surface Cracks with Enhanced Photoluminescence and Microscopic Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All they&#8242;re cracked up to be: C60 microstructures featuring surface cracks were synthesized for the first time from a phenetole/propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol (NPA) solvents system, in which phenetole and NPA molecules participate in the formation of the fcc ends and hcp sidewalls of the C60 microstructures, respectively. The introduction of surface cracks into C60 crystals benefits the photoluminescence enhancement and the development of microscopic recognition of C60 crystals, demonstrating their potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.







Abstract
Surface cracks could improve the optical and photoelectronic properties of crystalline materials as they increase specific surface area, but the controlled self&#8208;assembly of fullerene (C60) molecules into micro&#8208;/nanostructures with surface cracks is still challenging. Herein, we report the morphology engineering of novel C60 microstructures bearing surface cracks for the first time, selecting phenetole and propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol (NPA) as good and poor solvents, respectively. Our systematic investigations reveal that phenetole molecules initially participate in the formation of the ends of the C60 microstructures, and then NPA molecules are involved in the gradual growth of the sidewalls of the microstructures. Therefore, the surface cracks of C60 microstructures can be finely regulated by adjusting the addition of NPA and the crystallization time. Interestingly, the cracked C60 microstructures show superior photoluminescence properties relative to the smooth microstructures due to the increased specific surface area. In addition, C60 microstructures with wide cracks show preferential recognition of silica particles over C60 particles owing to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged C60 microstructures and the positively charged silica microparticles. These C60 crystals with surface cracks have potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.

A general and efficient method to prepare Ni/M heterobimetallic complexes (M=Mg, Al, Sc, Lu, Pt) of the general formula (&#951;4&#8722;C4R4M)Ni(COD) (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) is realized through the transmetalation reactions of aromatic dilithionickelole. In these reactions, two electrons of the aromatic nickelole dianion transfer to the Ni atom, representing a novel reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions. The bonding mode of these heterobimetallic complexes is studied by manifold experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
The aromatic metallole dianions are important metallaaromatic compounds because of their various reactivities and extensive synthetic applications. Herein we report the reactions of dilithionickelole with MgCl2, EtAlCl2, Cp*ScCl2, Cp*LuCl2 and Pt(COD)Cl2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) affording a series of Ni/M heterobimetallic complexes of the general formula (&#951;4&#8722;C4R4M)Ni(COD), in which the metalloles act as diene ligands, as suggested by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray, NMR and theoretical analyses. In these reactions, two electrons of the nickelole dianion transferred to Ni, representing different reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions.

Assisted self&#8208;assembly by using a preformed [Mn6O2(piv)10(4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)2(pivH)2] (1) (pivH=pivalic acid) cluster leads to 3 different outcomes of the reaction with Ln(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (Ln=Pr&#8722;Ho and Y): Mn7Ln3 and in some cases the inverse butterfly Mn2Ln2 for Ln=Pr&#8722;Eu, Mn5Ln4 for Ln=Tb&#8208;Ho and in the special case of Gd all three possibilities can form. Whilst the magnetic properties for the Mn5Ln4 systems show the expected known SMM properties, for Mn7Ln3 two new examples of Nd&#8208; and Sm&#8208;containing SMMs have been discovered.







Abstract
In an assisted self&#8208;assembly approach starting from the [Mn6O2(piv)10(4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)2(pivH)2] cluster a family of Mn&#8722;Ln compounds (Ln=Pr&#8722;Yb) was synthesised. The reaction of [Mn6O2(piv)10(4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)2(pivH)2] (1) with N&#8208;methyldiethanolamine (mdeaH2) and Ln(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O in MeCN generally yields two main structure types: for Ln=Tb&#8722;Yb a previously reported Mn5Ln4 motif is obtained, whereas for Ln=Pr&#8722;Eu a series of Mn7Ln3 clusters is obtained. Within this series the GdIII analogue represents a special case because it shows both structural types as well as a third Mn2Ln2 inverse butterfly motif. Variation in reaction conditions allows access to different structure types across the whole series. This prompts further studies into the reaction mechanism of this cluster assisted self&#8208;assembly approach. For the Mn7Ln3 analogues reported here variable&#8208;temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin carriers are dominant. Compounds incorporating Ln=NdIII(2), SmIII(3) and GdIII (5) display SMM behaviour. The slow relaxation of the magnetisation for these compounds was confirmed by ac measurements above 1.8&#8197;K.

         <title>Origin of the Rate Acceleration in the C&#8722;C Reductive Elimination from Pt(IV)&#8208;complex in a [Ga4L6]12&#8722; Supramolecular Metallocage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of microsolvation and encapsulation on the acceleration of the C&#8722;C reductive elimination from a Pt(IV) complex inside the [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage is evaluated. The comparison with a related encapsulated Au(III) reaction shows that whereas the Gibbs energy barrier reduction is similar their contribution it is not.







Abstract
The reductive elimination on [(Me3P)2Pt(MeOH)(CH3)3]+, 2P, complex performed in MeOH solution and inside a [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage are computationally analysed by mean of QM and MD simulations and compared with the mechanism of gold parent systems previously reported [Et3PAu(MeOH)(CH3)2]+, 2Au. The comparative analysis between the encapsulated Au(III) and Pt(IV)&#8208;counterparts shows that there are no additional solvent MeOH molecules inside the cavity of the metallocage for both systems. The Gibbs energy barriers for the 2P reductive elimination calculated at DFT level are in good agreement with the experimental values for both environments. The effect of microsolvation and encapsulation on the rate acceleration are evaluated and shows that the latter is far more relevant, conversely to 2Au. Energy decomposition analysis indicates that the encapsulation is the main responsible for most of the energy barrier reduction. Microsolvation and encapsulation effects are not equally contributing for both metal systems and consequently, the reasons of the rate acceleration are not the same for both metallic systems despite the similarity between them.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Molecular Winch Prototypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular machine: A family of loaded molecular winches were designed and synthesized as prototypes for mechanical studies at the single&#8208;molecule scale. The molecular winch structure derives from a molecular motor based on a ruthenium complex and is covalently linked to a series of molecular loads such as triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin fragments.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molecular machine&lt;/b&gt;: A family of loaded molecular winches were designed and synthesized as prototypes for mechanical studies at the single-molecule scale. The molecular winch structure derives from a molecular motor based on a ruthenium complex and is covalently linked to a series of molecular loads such as triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin fragments.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of conceptually new prototypes of molecular winches with the ultimate aim to investigate the work performed by a single ruthenium-based molecular motor anchored on a surface by probing its ability to pull a load upon electrically-driven directional rotation. According to a technomimetic design, the motor was embedded in a winch structure, with a long flexible polyethylene glycol chain terminated by an azide hook to connect a variety of molecular loads. The structure of the motor was first derivatized by means of two sequential cross-coupling reactions involving a penta(4-halogenophenyl)cyclopentadienyl hydrotris(indazolyl)borate ruthenium(II) precursor and the resulting benzylamine derivative was next exploited as key intermediate in the divergent synthesis of a family of nanowinch prototypes. A one-pot method involving sequential peptide coupling and Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition was developed to yield four loaded nanowinches, with load fragments encompassing triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin moieties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal catalysis has revolutionized synthetic chemistry, leading to entirely new, very efficient transformations, which enable access to complex functionalized molecules. One such new transformation method is the haloalkynylation reaction, in which both a halogen atom and an alkynyl unit are transferred to an unsaturated carbon&#8211;carbon bond. This minireview summarizes the developments of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions since their beginning about a decade ago. So far, arynes, alkenes and alkynes have been used as unsaturated systems and the reactivities of these systems are summarized in individual chapters of the minireview. Especially, the last few years have witnessed a rapid development due to gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, we discuss how the choice of the catalytic system influences the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Jahn&#8211;Teller Effects in a Vanadate&#8208;Stabilized Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Heuristic rules that allow identifying the preferred mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis arrangements in the&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;water oxidation catalyst [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; and its activated form [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; are&lt;br /&gt;derived. These rules are based on computing all combinatorially possible mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis&lt;br /&gt;arrangements of the Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; atoms, and associate energetic costs with some structural features, like crossings of multiple&lt;br /&gt;Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axes, the location of these axes, or the involved ligands. It is found that the different oxidation states localize&lt;br /&gt;on different Mn centers, giving rise to clear Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller distortions, unlike in previous crystallographic findings where an&lt;br /&gt;apparent valence delocalization was found. The low barriers that connect different Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis arrangements suggest&lt;br /&gt;that the system quickly interconverts between them, leading to the observation of averaged bond lengths in the crystal&lt;br /&gt;structure. We conclude that the combination of cubane&#8208;vanadate bonds that are chemically inert, cubane&#8208;acetate/water&lt;br /&gt;bonds that can be activated through a Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis, and low activation barriers for intramolecular rearrangement of&lt;br /&gt;the Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axes plays an essential role in the reactivity of this and probably related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>How to Look for Compounds: Predictive Screening and in&#8197;situ Studies in Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure prediction algorithm was used to assess the stability of the ternary compounds in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system followed by rapid experimental screening via the hydride synthesis route and in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Such a synergistic approach has yielded four new compounds in the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system. The advanced electronic structure calculation for the synthesized compounds were performed to rationalize the experimentally observed non&#8208;stoichiometry, while in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed the high&#8208;temperature polymorphism.







Abstract
Here, the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8197;situ diffraction studies is demonstrated as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system, such an approach led to four novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P
) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm
m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611&#8197;K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5&#8197;GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elementary steps of metal&#8208;mediated catalysis e.&#8201;g., oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination are pertinent to the design of superior routes into specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. For over 50&#8197;years, pioneering work has shown that 18&#8208;electron alkyl/aryl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 [M(diphosphine)2] do not oxidatively add haloarenes. Herein, we report a compound that is contrary to this &#8216;rule&#8217;, advancing our understanding of oxidative addition at coordinatively saturated organometallic complexes and providing new opportunities for bond activation.







Abstract
Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] (P2BCy4=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane) is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron &#954;1&#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the P2BCy4 secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8] with PhI provides [NiII(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8(I)]I via iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and not a [NiII(Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an unusual secondary sphere effect. Finally, the reactivity of [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.

         <title>Full&#8208;Atom Model of the Agonist LPS&#8208;Bound Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 Dimer in a Membrane Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pushing against the limits of all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations&#8242; capability, the agonist lipopolysaccharide&#8208;bound full&#8208;length Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 dimer complex, embedded into a realistic plasma membrane, is addressed. Atomic/molecular and thermodynamic insights are provided for TLR4&#8242;s assembly and biological activity.







Abstract
The Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD&#8208;2) innate immunity system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We have combined ab&#8208;initio calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies give functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular Toll/Interleukin&#8208;1 receptor domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)2 architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.

Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates.

Abstract
Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron&#8208;accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD, that is, where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile, and an anthryl moiety, that is, acting as a diene. The resulting anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron&#8208;accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical, and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8208;TCBD&#8208;based reactant into the anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Properties and Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stoichiometric Cocrystals Containing Tetrabromobenzene as a Hydrogen&#8208; and Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal expansion defines by composition: Cocrystals containing different stoichiometric ratios of the components 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene (TBrB) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azobipyridine (Azo) exhibit dramatically different thermal expansion (TE) behaviors. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The structural differences results in the unique TE behaviors for each solid. The cocrystals form concomitantly, and mechanochemical synthesis demonstrates that mixtures or pure phases can be synthesized by varying the feed ratios of the components.







Abstract
The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols in the spotlight: Phenol and its derivatives are key moieties in organic chemistry. Conventionally, they are prepared through thermal functionalization strategies that present several drawbacks. Recently, alternative photochemical approaches have been implemented that involves phenols both as light&#8208;harvesting substrates or as photo&#8208;redox catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the most relevant examples within this field, highlighting the great versatility of simple phenolic frameworks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Phenols (I) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (I), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (I) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors via single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives I to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Based on Barbituric Derivative: Multi&#8208;faceted Bending and Flexible Optical Waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecule (DBDT) was synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step reaction, and the centimeter&#8208;scale needle&#8208;like crystals were prepared by slow volatilization in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. Fortunately, the elastic crystals also exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state.







Abstract
Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multi&#8208;faceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative DBDT, which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) were 0.28&#177;0.01&#8197;GPa and 4.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627&#8197;nm were 0.7&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 0.9&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 1.8&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state) at 567&#8197;nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.

         <title>Kinetic Stabilization of Blue&#8208;Emissive Anthracenes: Phenylene Bridging Works Best</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes a series of 9,10&#8208;biarylated derivatives were investigated. Bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substitution highly increased photochemical and photooxidative stability. Ring closure to [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;hexaphenylene bridged anthracene increased protection even further resulting in an additional stabilization.







Abstract
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10&#8208;diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10&#8208;biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; sky&#8208;blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time&#8208;resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Explaining the Advantageous Impact of Tertiary versus Secondary Nitrogen Centre on the Activity of PNP&#8208;Pincer Co(I)&#8208;Complexes for Catalytic Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pincer ligated coordination complexes of base metals have shown remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO  2  .&#160;The recently reported MeN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP&#8208;pincer complex was shown to exhibit substantially higher catalytic activity in comparison to the corresponding catalyst,&#160; HN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP, bearing a secondary nitrogen center on the pincer ligand. Here, we computationally investigate the mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO  2  to formate catalyzed by these two Co&#8208;PNP complexes to explain how such a small structural difference could have a sizable impact on their catalytic activity. Plausible hydrogenation routes were examined in details and our findings provide solid support for the experimental observations. Our results reveal that such trends in catalytic activity could be explained from the lower activation barrier for the hydride transfer step upon changing the pincer nitrogen center from secondary to tertiary.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective [2+2+1] Hydrative Annulation of Phenol&#8208;Linked 1,6&#8208;Enynes With Acetylenes Through Rhodium Catalysis: A Rapid Access to Cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;type Character</title>

         <dc:description>The bicyclic amido&#8208;substituted silicon(I) ring compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  2  (Mes = Mesityl = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  ) features enhanced zwitterionic character and different reactivity compared to the analogous compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Dipp}  4  1  (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) due to the smaller mesityl substituents. In a reaction with the  N  heterocyclic carbene (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene = NHC  Me4  ) we observe adduct formation to Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  (  3  ). This adduct reacts further with the Lewis acid BH  3  to yield the Lewis acid base complex Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  &#8729;BH  3  (  4  ). Coordination of AlBr  3  to  2  leads to the adduct  5  . Calculated proton affinities and fluoride ion affinities reveal highly Lewis basic and very weak Lewis acidic character of the low&#8208;valent silicon atoms in  1  and  2  .

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminum Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n = 1&#8211;10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated aluminum cations are investigated as a photochemical model system with up to 10 water molecules by UV action spectroscopy in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT&#8208;ICR) mass spectrometer. Intense photodissociation has been observed starting at 4.5 eV ranging from two to eight water molecules by loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for  n  = 2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s&#8208;3p excitations of Al+  into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5 eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1  to T2  takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2  surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1  . On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminum, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminum dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed up to  n  = 8. Clusters with  n  = 9,10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For  n  = 4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n  and HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  is present in the experiment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper reports the first example of C&#8211;H arylation of benzene under mild conditions, using H  2  as an electron source {turnover numbers (TONs) = 0.7&#8211;2.0 for 24 h}. The reaction depends on a Rh&#8208;based electron storage catalyst, and proceeds at room temperature and in aqueous solution.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative C&#8211;H Silylation of Alkynylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes via dehydrogenative coupling of alkylnylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones. 36 compounds were synthesized for the first time applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalizations (e.g., hydrosilylation). &#160;The use of primary silanes as substrates and pre&#8208;catalyst activators permits the utilization of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal pre&#8208;catalysts and avoids the presence of additional activators.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;controlled synthesis of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc oligosaccharides using an endo&#8208;glycosynthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in  Pichia pastoris  at 52 mg.L  &#8208;1  provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective  N  &#8208;deacetylation at the non&#8208;reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by  Sinorhizobium meliloti  NodB chitin&#8208;  N  &#8208;deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65% and a perfect control over their size.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long-chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)-linked  N  -acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high-affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two-enzyme cascade to synthesize long-chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)-linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) in  Pichia pastoris  at 52 mg.L  -1  provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;-chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective  N  -deacetylation at the non-reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by  Sinorhizobium meliloti  NodB chitin-  N  -deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one-pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis of chitin hexa-, hepta- and octasaccharides with yields up to 65% and a perfect control over their size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing inorganic coordination chemistry by spectroscopy of isolated molecules: methods and applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique feature of the work carried out in the Collaborative Research Center 3MET continues to be its emphasis on innovative, advanced experimental methods which hyphenate mass&#8208;selection with further analytical tools such as laser spectroscopy for the study of  isolated  molecular ions. This allows to probe the intrinsic properties of the species of interest free of perturbing solvent or matrix effects. This review explains these methods and uses examples from past and ongoing 3MET studies of specific classes of multicenter metal complexes to illustrate how coordination chemistry can be advanced by applying them. As a corollary, we will show how the challenges involved in providing well&#8208;defined, e.g. monoisomeric, samples of the molecular ions have helped to further improve the methods themselves thus also making them applicable to many other areas of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>THF&#8208;solvated Heavy Alkali Metal Benzyl Compounds (Na, Rb, Cs): Defined Deprotonation Reagents for Alkali Metal Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heavy alkali metals into substrates is both challenging and essential for many reactions. Here, we report the formation of thf&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds [PhCH  2  M(thf)  n  ] ( M = Na, Rb, Cs). The synthesis was carried out by deprotonation of toluene with the bimetallic mixture n&#8208;butyllithium/alkali metal&#160;tert&#8208;butoxide&#160;and selective crystallization from thf of the defined benzyl compounds. Insights into the molecular structure in the solid as well as in solution state are gained by single crystal X&#8208;ray experiments and NMR spectroscopic studies. The compounds could be successfully used as alkali metal mediating reagents. The example of caesium showed the convenient use by deprotonating acidic C&#8211;H as well as N&#8211;H compounds to gain insight into the aminometalation using these reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe  1&#8208;x  Co  x  O  3  catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost maybe originated from a slower deactivation rate of the Co  3+  sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet and dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.</dc:description>

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reversible Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence color in an acidic environment, which allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Since the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted, simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and efficient postsynthetic DNA labeling in cells by means of strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3&#8208;dipoles that react with cyclooctynes via strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). While they have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids, however, have not yet been tagged via SPSAC. Evaluation of the SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.191 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single&#8208;stranded DNA, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in vitro and in cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable linear and nonlinear optical properties from room temperature phosphorescent cyclic triimidazole&#8208;pyrene bio&#8208;probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with multiple emissions tunable by external stimuli represent a great challenge. TTPyr, crystallizing in different polymorphs, shows a very rich photophyisics comprising excitation&#8208;dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence at ambient conditions, and mechanochromic and thermochromic behavior. Transformation among the different species has been followed by thermal and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the emissive features interpreted through structural results and DFT/TDDFT calculations. Particularly intriguing is the polymorph obtained at high temperature, TTPyr(HT), whose non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure guarantees an SHG efficiency 10 times higher than that of standard urea. Its crystal packing, where only the TT units are strongly rigidified by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions while the Pyr moieties possess partial conformational freedom, is responsible for the observed dual fluorescence. The potentialities of TTPyr for bioimaging have been successfully established.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Reactions at a Platinum Carbene Complex: Reaction Routes to SF3, S(=O)F and Fluorido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron&#8208;rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)  2  ] (IMes: [1,3bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds. The sulfur fluoride SF  4  undergoes a rapid oxidative addition at Pt  0  to yield  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SF  3  )(IMes)  2  ]. A photolytic reaction of SF  6  at [Pt(IMes)  2  ] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)  2  (IMes)  2  ] and  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SF  3  )(IMes)  2  ] along with  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)  2  ] and  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)] (IMes&#8217;: cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water.  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)  2  ] and  trans  [Pt(F)  2  (IMes)  2  ] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)  2  ] with SOF  2  or XeF  2  . A reaction of [Pt(IMes)  2  ] with a HF source gave  trans  &#8208;[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)  2  ], and an intermediate bifluorido complex  trans  &#8208;[Pt(H)(FHF)(IMes)  2  ] was identified. Compound  trans  [Pt(H)(F)(IMes)  2  ] converts in the presence of CsF into  trans  [Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)].</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated Water&#8208;soluble Pseudorotaxanes Comprising a Cucurbit[7]uril and a Flavylium&#8208;based Axle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central chalcone moiety is shown to provide two independent binding sites with similar affinity for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) macrocycles in water as judged from NMR, UV&#8208;Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Association results in [2] and [3]pseudorotaxanes, which are both pH and photosensitive. Switching from the neutral chalcone to the cationic flavylium form upon irradiation at 365 nm under acidic conditions provided an enhanced CB7 association (  K  1:1  &#160;increases from&#160;1.2&#160;x&#160;10  5  &#160;M  &#8722;1  &#160;to 1.5&#160;x&#160;10  8  &#160;M  &#8722;1  ), limiting spontaneous on&#8208;thread cucurbituril shuttling. This co&#8208;conformational change in the [2]pseudorotaxane is reversible in the dark with&#160;  k  obs  &#160;= 4.1&#160;x&#160;10  &#8208;4  &#160;s  &#8208;1  . Threading the flavylium moiety into CB7 leads to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, from 0.29 in the free axle to 0.97 in the [2]pseudorotaxane and 1.0 in the [3]pseudorotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Macroscopic Chirality of Coordination Polymers through pH and Anion&#8208;Mediated Weak Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical architectures with controllable helical sense bias have recently attracted considerable interest for mimicking biological helices and developing novel chiral materials. Coordination polymers (CPs), composed of metal ion nodes and organic linkers, are intriguing systems showing tunable structures and functions. However, CPs with helical morphologies have rarely been explored so far. Particularly, chirality inversion through external stimulus has not been achieved in helical CPs. In this work, we carried out an in&#8208;depth investigation on the self&#8208;assembly of 1D gadolinium(III) phosphonate CPs using GdX  3  (X = Cl, Br, I) and Gd(RSO  3  ) (R = CH  3  , C  6  H  5  , CF  3  ) as metal sources and  R  &#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethylamino)methyl phosphonic acid (  R  &#8208;pempH  2  ) as ligand. Superhelices were formed by precise control of the interchain interactions through different intercalated anions. Furthermore, the twisting direction of superhelices could be controlled by the synergistic effect of anions and pH. This study may provide a new route to fabricate helical nanostructures of CPs with a desirable chiral sense and help understand the inner mechanism of the self&#8208;assembly process of macroscopic helical structures of molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Native electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) allow researchers to analyze intact biomolecules and their complexes by mass spectrometry (MS). The data acquired using these soft ionization techniques provide a snapshot of a given biomolecules structure in solution. Over the last thirty years, several nESI and ESI sources capable of controlling spray solution temperature have been developed. These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques. This review highlights how the field of temperature&#8208;controlled mass spectrometry has developed.</dc:description>

         <title>On the hydrogen oxalate binding motifs onto dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the binding geometries of the isomers that are formed when the hydrogen oxalate ((CO  2  )  2  H = HOx) anion attaches to dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes of the form M  1  M  2  dcpm  2  (HOx) with M=Cu, Ag and dcpm = bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)methane, abbreviated [MM]  +  . These structures are established by comparison of isomer&#8208;selective experimental vibrational band patterns displayed by the cryogenically cooled and N  2  &#8208;tagged cations with DFT calculations of the predicted spectra for various local minima. Two isomeric classes are identified that feature either attachment of the carboxylate oxygen atoms to the two metal centers (end&#8208;on docking) or attachment of oxygen atoms on different carbon atoms asymmetrically to the metal ions (side&#8208;on docking). Within each class, there are additional isomeric variations according to the orientation of the OH group. This behavior indicates that HOx undergoes strong and directional coordination to [CuCu]  +  but adopts a more flexible coordination to [AgAg]  +  . Infrared spectra of the bare ions, fragmentation thresholds and ion mobility measurements are reported to explore the behaviors of the complexes at ambient temperature.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tf  2  O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidine and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf  2  O, aza&#8208;allene species in situ generated through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments. The reaction had good substrate extensibility with moderate to excellent yield including trimethylsilylalkynes. The utilization as a useful synthetic tool in preparation of the luminescent metal complex was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

The reaction had good substrate extensibility with moderate to excellent yield including trimethylsilylalkynes. The utilization as a useful synthetic tool in preparation of the luminescent metal complex was also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NMR crystallography reveals carbonate induced Al&#8208;ordering in ZnAl layered double hydroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) serve a score of applications in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH 8.5, pH 10.0, pH 12.5) with a Zn/Al ratio of 2, without subsequent hydrothermal treatment to avoid extensive recrystallisation. In ideal configuration, all Al cations should be part of the LDH and be coordinated with 6 Zn atoms, but NMR revealed two different Al local environments were present in all samples in a ratio dependent on synthesis pH. NMR&#8208;crystallography, integrating NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, succeeded to identify them as Al residing in the highly ordered crystalline phase, next to Al in disordered material. With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased and the side&#8208;phase fraction decreased. Using  1  H&#8208;  13  C,&#160;  13  C&#8208;  27  Al HETCOR NMR in combination with  27  Al MQMAS,  27  Al&#8208;DQ&#8208;SQ measurements and Rietveld refinement on high&#8208;resolution PXRD data, the extreme anion exchange selectivity of these LDHs for CO  3  2&#8208;  over HCO  3  &#8208;  was linked to strict Al and CO  3  2&#8208;  ordering in the crystalline LDH. Even upon equilibration of the LDH in pure NaHCO  3  solutions, only CO  3  2&#8208;  was adsorbed by the LDH. This reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO  3  2&#8208;  during crystallization of [M  2+4  M3+2  (OH)2  ]2+  [A  2&#8211;  ]  1  &#8729;yH  2  O LDH phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Bilayer rGO&#8208;based Photothermal Evaporator for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial evaporation has emerged as a promising approach to produce freshwater. However, an urgent concern is that, due to the illegal discharge of industrial wastewater, most water bodies are polluted by trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are easily volatilized and enriched in the collected water during the interfacial evaporation process. Herein, a bilayer photothermal evaporator was reasonably designed for contaminated water purification. The bottom hydrophilic rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) sheets purposefully disintegrate water transport channels, thus quickly removing VOCs through physical adsorption. The rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer sufficiently absorbs incident light and therefore persistently generates reactive oxidizing species to degrade upward VOCs. Notably, the oriented microchannels inside the evaporator allow sustained light reflections to improve the utilization of solar energy. The evaporation rate can reach 1.63 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a considerably high VOC removal efficiency of up to 96%. Such an integrated bilayer evaporator provides an effective strategy to obtain clean water via solar distillation.</dc:description>

         <title>Failure&#8208;experiment&#8208;supported optimization of poorly reproducible synthetic conditions for novel lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks with two&#8208;dimensional secondary building units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based secondary building units (KGF&#8208;3) were synthesized using machine learning (ML). Isolating pure KGF&#8208;3 was challenging, and the synthesis was not reproducible because impurity phases were frequently obtained under the same synthetic conditions. Thus, dominant factors for the synthesis of KGF&#8208;3 were identified, and its synthetic conditions were optimized using two ML techniques. Cluster analysis was used to classify the obtained powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry patterns of the products and thus automatically determine whether the experiments were successful. Decision tree analysis was used to visualize the experimental results, after extracting factors that mainly affected the synthetic reproducibility. Water adsorption isotherms revealed that KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores. Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (  &#963;  = 5.2 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  for KGF&#8208;3(Y)) at a high temperature (363 K) and relative humidity of 95% RH.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioengineered Protein&#8208;based Adhesives for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based adhesives with their robust adhesion performance and excellent biocompatibility have been extensively explored over years. In particular, the unique adhesion behaviors of mussel and sandcastle worm inspired the development of synthetic adhesives. However, the chemical synthesized adhesives often demonstrate weak underwater adhesion performance and poor biocompatibility/biodegradability, limiting their further biomedical applications. In sharp contrast, genetically engineering endows the protein&#8208;based adhesives the ability to maintain underwater adhesion property as well as biocompatibility/biodegradability. Herein, we outline recent advances in the design and development of protein&#8208;based adhesives by genetic engineering. We summarize the fabrication and adhesion performance of elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;based adhesives, followed by mussel foot protein (mfp) based adhesives and other sources protein&#8208;based adhesives, such as, spider silk spidroin and suckerin. In addition, the biomedical applications of these bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented. Finally, we give a brief summary and perspective on the future development of bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Property for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.</dc:description>
