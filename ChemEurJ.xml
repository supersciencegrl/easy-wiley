         <title>Pathway&#8208;dependent Metallosupramolecular Polymerization Regulated by Ligand Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding structure/property correlations in self&#8208;assembly is a key but challenging requirement for developing functional materials. Herein, we explore the importance of ligand geometry to tune photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited states) and self&#8208;assembly pathways in metallosupramolecular polymerization. To this end, we have designed two hydrophobic Pt(II) complexes, 1 and 2, containing a &#960;&#8208;extended bidentate bipyridine ligand with different substitution pattern, resulting in different molecular geometries (linear vs V&#8208;shaped). Detailed comparative studies revealed significant differences for both complexes in terms of their photophysical properties and self&#8208;assembly pathways in non&#8208;polar media. The V&#8208;shaped topology of 1 enables facile face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking with a certain curvature leading to luminescent spherical assemblies exhibiting MMLCT states and short Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt contacts via a single&#8208;step cooperative pathway. On the other hand, the higher preorganized linear topology of complex 2 induces a two&#8208;step competitive self&#8208;assembly process leading to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers with slipped packing and MLCT&#8208;originated emission. Our findings broaden the monomer scope for supramolecular polymerization and provide design guidelines for the realization of luminescent supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Synthesis of C20&#8208;epi&#8208;Isothiocyanato&#8208;Salinomycin and Its Thiourea Derivatives as Potential Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salinomycin, a naturally occurring polyether ionophore antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces albus, has been demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity against a variety of cancer cell lines. In particular, it exhibits selective targeting of cancer stem cells. However, systemic toxicity, drug resistance and low bioavailability of the drug significantly limit its potential applications. In this study, the C20&#8208;epi&#8208;isothiocyanate of salinomycin was designed and synthesized, and then reacted with amines as a versatile synthon to assemble a series of salinomycin thiourea derivatives, which improved the druggability of salinomycin. The antiproliferative activities of the compounds were evaluated in vitro against A549, HepG2, Hela, 4T1, and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines using the CCK&#8208;8 assay. The pharmacological results showed that some salinomycin thiourea derivatives exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested tumor cells and high selectivity. Further mechanistic studies showed that compound 9f, containing a 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzyl moiety, could directly induce apoptosis, probably by increasing caspase&#8208;9 protein expression and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase in a concentration dependent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Sugars to Lactic Acid using homogeneous Niobium&#8208;substituted Polyoxometalate Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic conversion of biomass into high&#8208;value chemicals is an increasing field of research. This study uniquely investigates the use of various Keggin&#8208;type heteropoly salts (HPS) for the chemical conversion of sugars into lactic acid under mild conditions of 160&#176;C and 20 bar N2. In the first phase, Nb&#8208; and V&#8208;substituted HPSs were employed to synthesize lactic acid from dihydroxyacetone, an intermediate in the conversion of sugars to lactic acid. Results indicated that increasing the Nb content within the Keggin structure enhances the yield of lactic acid while reducing the formation of the byproduct acetaldehyde. A correlation was established between the redox activity of the HPS and the catalytic performance. The most active catalyst, Na5[PNb2Mo10O40], (NaNb2) achieved a lactic acid yield of 20.9% after 1 h of reaction. In the second phase of the study, NaNb2 was applied for the conversion of different sugars including glucose, fructose, mannose, sucrose, xylose, and cellobiose. It was demonstrated that the catalyst remains active for complex hexoses, achieving lactic acid yields of up to 12%. Post&#8208;mortem analysis using infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) confirmed the stability of NaNb2.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Crystalline Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Surfactant Complex with Chiral Supramolecular Structure and Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal with a helical structure and tunable CPL was fabricated by a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation. This material exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and a helical structure without inherent chirality. Chiral solvation imparts TPE&#8208;DHAB with a preferred handedness, enabling tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) when using a chiral solvent.







Abstract
A novel room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal of tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8208;DHAB) was synthesized using an ionic self&#8208;assembly strategy. The TPE&#8208;DHAB complex exhibits typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties and a unique helical supramolecular structure. Moreover, the generation and handedness inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) can be achieved through further chiral solvation, providing a facile approach to fabricate room&#8208;temperature liquid crystalline materials with controllable supramolecular structures and tunable CPL properties through a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation process.

         <title>Inhibition of Lysosomal Cathepsin A and Neuraminidase 1 Interaction by Anti&#8208;Obesity Cyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stylissatin A and its analogs are shown to inhibit the interaction between mature protective protein cathepsin A and neuraminidase 1 in lysosomes, which caused irregular proteolysis of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation in adipocytes. This PPI&#8208;modulating effect is promising to develop anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;obesity drug leads.







Abstract
Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novel small molecules targeting adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation offer potential for new anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;obesity drugs. Here we show that the marine cyclic heptapeptide stylissatin A and its analogs (SAs) inhibit membranous neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) function by interacting with lysosomal protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA). Neu1 has been less explored as a therapeutic target due to the genetic defects leading to neurodegenerative disorders. However, unlike traditional neuraminidase inhibitors, SAs don't directly bind to Neu1 but modulate the molecular chaperone activity of PPCA. SAs caused degradation of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation, along with decrease in membranous Neu1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SAs interacted with activated PPCA at the Neu1 binding site. Focusing on this newfound protein&#8211;protein interaction inhibition mechanism could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects.

Both theoretical analysis and experimental data have confirmed the crucial role of the 4s lone pair electrons of the Ge atom in inducing SHG response and electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The lone pair electrons in the electronic structure of molecules have been a prominent research focus in chemistry for more than a century. Stable s2 lone pair electrons significantly influence material properties, including thermoelectric properties, nonlinear optical properties, ferroelectricity, and electro(photo)catalysis. While major advances have been achieved in understanding the influence of lone pair electrons on material characteristics, research on this effect in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials is in its initial stage. In this work, we successfully obtained a novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional material incorporating Ge with 4s2 lone pair electrons, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8208;H2O (MeHDabco=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (1). Driven by the stereochemically active lone pair electrons on the Ge2+, 1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21 at room temperature and exhibits good second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Interestingly, 1 also shows electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the existence of lone pair electrons on Ge2+ cations. The electrochemical experiment combined with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the lone pair electrons act as both an active site for proton adsorption and facilitate the ionization of water. This work not only emphasizes the important role of lone pair electrons in material properties and functions but also provides new insight for designing novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid materials.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of fluorinated benzenesulfonamides were synthesized and characterized by their anti&#8208;amyloid potential. We investigated compound structure relationship for inhibiting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) aggregation, which is considered to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized molecules were effective at slowing down the A&#946; aggregation by extending its nucleation phase and reduced aggregate toxicity to SHSY&#8208;5Y cells.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide aggregation process by more than three&#8208;fold. We synthesized a series of ortho&#8208;para and meta&#8208;para double&#8208;substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross&#8208;sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Structural Deformations in Cucurbit[n]urils: Analysis, Host&#8208;Guest Dependence, and Automated Ellipticity Measurements Using ElliptiCB[n]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We report development and use of ElliptiCB[n], which provides automated measurements of cucurbituril ellipticities. We also include a detailed analysis of all prior crystallographically characterized CB[5,6,7,8,10] hosts







Abstract
Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) are cyclic macrocycles with rich host&#8208;guest chemistry. In many cases, guest binding in CB[n]s results in host structural deformations. Unfortunately, measuring such deformations remains a major challenge, with only a handful of manual estimations reported in the literature. To address this challenge, we have developed the public program ElliptiCB[n], which is available on GitHub, that provides a robust and automated method for measuring the elliptical deformations in CB[n] hosts. We outline the development and validation of this approach, apply ElliptiCB[n] to measure the ellipticity of the 1113 available CB[n] structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), and directly investigate the structural deformations of CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10] hosts. We also report the general landscape of accessible CB[n] elliptical deformations and compare ellipticity distributions across CB[n] hosts and host&#8208;guest complexes. We found that in almost all cases guest binding significantly impacts the distribution of host ellipticity distributions and that these distributions are dissimilar across host&#8208;guest complexes of differently sized CB[n]s. We anticipate that this work will provide a useful approach for understanding of the flexibility of CB[n] hosts and will also enable future measurement and standardization of ellipticity measurements of CB[n]s.

         <title>N&#8208;Halosuccinimide&#8208;CeCl3 Transient Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes as Semi Heterogeneous Photocatalyst in Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work, photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride formed a transient charge&#8208;transfer complex with NXS (X=Br, I) in acetonitrile, acting as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. This facilitated Ce(III) ion light absorption, creating halide radicals that converted N&#8208;propargylamides to oxazole aldehydes. Experiments confirmed a single electron transfer pathway. The CeCl3 was reusable with minimal decomposition.







Abstract
In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.

         <title>Magnetic Chitosan/ZrO2 Composites for Vanadium(V) Adsorption while Concurrently being Transformed to a Dual Functional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composite material (MZT) adsorbent for V(V) adsorption. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole and enhanced natural photocatalytic degradation Rhodamine B. The study proposes a resourceful, effective method for repurposing waste via natural photocatalytic reactions leveraging clean energy, potentially contributing to environmental preservation and presenting innovative avenues for spent adsorbent recovery.







Abstract
Spent adsorbents for recycling as catalysts have drawn considerable attention due to their environmentally benign chemistry properties. However, traditional thermocatalytic strategies limit their applications. Here, we developed an enhanced photocatalytic strategy to expand the range of their applications. A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composites (MZT) for V(V) adsorption, which were prepared using chitosan, ZrO2 and Fe3O4 by one&#8208;pot synthesis. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, yielding up to 89.7&#8201;%. It also was implemented to photocatalysis reactions for recycle. The discolored rates of rhodamine B (RhB) were 72.3&#8201;% and 97.4&#8201;% by new and spent MZT, respectively. The new and spent MZT showed the forbidden bands were 251&#8197;nm and 561&#8197;nm, respectively. The result displayed spent MZT red shifted to the cyan light region. The mechanism of catalysis also has been studied in detail.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;Earth Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

The graphic depicts RE&#8208;CU&#8208;45, a rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;organic framework, which features 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid linkers and hexanuclear RE(III) clusters (RE(III)=Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Tm(III), Yb(III), Lu(III), and Y(III)). The MOF linker can be excited at 290&#8197;nm and, through the antenna effect, promote energy transfer to the RE(III) ions, leading to emission in the visible and/or near&#8208;infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.







Abstract
In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE=Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push&#8208;Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesize new push&#8211;pull compounds characterized by naphthalimide as electron acceptor and by different electron donors such as tetraphenylethylene, triphenylamine and phenothiazine. Our time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic results show that TADF is occurring in the yellow and orange&#8211;red ranges of the visible. Fluorescence quantum yields are surprisingly large, triggered by the conjugation enhancement achieved through the synthetic effort.







Abstract
In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures. The structure&#8211;property relationships are investigated through a joint experimental time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic and computational TD&#8211;DFT study. The femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8211;conversion experiments reveal ultrafast photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. This is likely the key factor leading to efficient spin&#8211;orbit CT&#8211;induced intersystem crossing for the TPA&#8211; and PTZ&#8211;derivatives as well as to small singlet&#8211;to&#8211;triplet energy gap. Consequently, evidence for a delayed fluorescence component is found together with the main prompt emission in the fluorescence kinetics both in solution and in thin film. The weight of the Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) is greatly enhanced when these fluorophores are used as guests in solid&#8211;state host matrices. TADF is interestingly revealed in the orange&#8211;red region of the visible. Such long wavelength emission is here observed with surprisingly large fluorescence quantum yields, thanks to the conjugation enhancement achieved in these newly synthesized structures relative to previous studies. Our findings may be thus promising for the future development of efficient third generation TADF&#8211;based OLEDs.

         <title>Mechanochemical Diversity in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural parameters are known to govern covalent polymer mechanochemistry, but the complexity increases when chemically different chains are linked by covalent bonds, as in block copolymers (BCPs). This review highlights studies trying to define structure&#8208;activity relationship in the mechanochemistry of BCPs in various states, with an emphasis on the influence of their morphologies.







Abstract
Covalent polymer chains are known to undergo mechanochemical events when subjected to mechanical forces. Such force&#8208;coupled reactions, like C&#8722;C bond scission in homopolymers, typically occur in a non&#8208;selective manner but with a higher probability at the mid&#8208;chain. In contrast, block copolymers (BCPs), composed of two or more chemically distinct chains linked by covalent bonds, have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different mechanochemical reactivities and selectivities. These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self&#8208;assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force&#8208;sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.

         <dc:description>
A mild and facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite leading to organic nitrate esters has been developed at room temperature in air. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds smoothly to afford the corresponding organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air the green oxidant.







Abstract
A simple and efficient strategy has been developed for the synthesis of organic nitrate esters via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite under open air atmosphere. This transformation could be conducted under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions to provide a number of organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air as the green oxidant.

(&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers are prepared as a new motif from tosylate 3. The motif has a preferred &#8216;propellar&#8217; conformation which can adopt left or right handed twists. LogP's are lower than tert&#8208;butyl analogues. Interactions between TFNP groups in the solid state are shown to also anchor supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
A route is developed to (&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8722;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their neopentyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Oxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides and oxamates yields N&#8208;aryloxamates in moderate to excellent yields, especially when oxamates bear bulky tertiary alkyl groups. These oxamates are hydrolyzed to oxamic acids, then converted into urethanes using PIDA or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and oxamates is shown to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryloxamates with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, when the oxamate precursor incorporates a bulky tertiary alkyl group effectively preventing product degradation under the strongly basic reaction conditions. The final oxamic acids are then generated through the acid hydrolysis of the oxamate in high yields. These acids were then converted into urethanes using PIDA under thermal conditions or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process. While electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;aryl oxamic acids provide urethanes with high efficiencies, electron&#8208;rich counterparts led to diminished yields due to aryl group over&#8208;oxidation induced by PIDA.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Chemically Programmed Amphiphiles into Aqueous Nanotubes with a Lipophilic Lumen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel nanotubes of ca. 4&#8197;nm in diameter self&#8208;assembled in water from custom&#8208;tailored amphiphiles are able to selectively encapsulate apolar molecules within their lipophilic lumen.







Abstract
The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials. Here, we have further developed a bioinspired methodology for the formation of aqueous nanotubes of well&#8208;defined dimensions and pore coating through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles that are chemically programmed with complementary nucleobases. These nanotubes are endowed with a hydrophobic lumen, whose diameter can be expanded as a function of the monomer length, in which apolar dyes can be efficiently encapsulated.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;bromo&#8208;/iodo&#8208;pyridinium Salts and its Application in Chromatography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of 3&#8208;/4&#8208;bromo&#8208; and &#8208;iodopyridine with methyl triflate smoothly affords the corresponding&#160;N&#8208;methylpyridinium triflate salts. An anion exchange with NaI or [PPh4]Y (Y = Cl, Br, I) yields the corresponding halide salts. Most of them could be structurally characterized and their strong halogen bonds were investigated. While the halogen atom of 4&#8208;halogenopyridinium is susceptible to nucleophilic substitution, 3&#8208;halogenopyridinium ions are far more stable against nucleophilic attacks. Due to the comparable interaction strength of halogen bonds and hydrogen bonds, the latter of which is widely used in chromatography, the potential of 3&#8208;halogenopyridinium moieties for an application in chromatography is obvious and was&#160;successfully employed in affinity chromatography of different&#160;proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>The Journey for the Synthesis of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since the synthesis of heptacene in 2006, the race to obtain and study the properties of largest acenes resulted in the development of innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to on&#8208;surface chemistry. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of large acenes, up to tridecacene, highlighting the newest studies.







Abstract
Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of large acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.

Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid-state chemistry to the promising on-surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of large acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrel Bond Affects the Self&#8208;Assembly of Acetylcholine and its Analogues and is an Ancillary Interaction in Protein Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical findings show that the C atoms of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety of acetylcholine and some analogues form tetrel bonds that are robust enough to assemble cations into supramolecular infinite chains; similar tetrel bonds are present also in substrate/protein adducts, specifically they act as ancillary interactions in the binding of these &#8722;N+(CH3)3 containing compounds to proteins.







Abstract
The &#8722;N+(CH3)3 residue is present in acetylcholine (ACh) and in many of its analogues which are used as selective ACh agonist or antagonists for human therapy. The X&#8208;ray structures of four ACh derivatives show the presence of short and linear contacts between the C atoms of &#8722;N+(CH3)3 groups and lone pair possessing atoms. These contacts can be rationalized as tetrel bonds (TtBs) thanks to their geometric features. Interrogation of the Protein Data Bank suggests that similar &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts affect the details of the binding of ACh and its derivatives to proteins. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules, noncovalent interaction plot, and natural bond orbital analyses consistently confirm that the &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts observed in small molecule crystals and in substrate/protein complexes are attractive in nature and can be rationalized as TtBs. TtBs involving methyl groups of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety can be proposed as a new item in the palette of interactions allowing the compounds containing this pharmacophoric unit to bind to their target protein and/or to express their biological/pharmacological properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleosidic diarylethenes was modified in three different ways by varying the connection between nucleoside and thiophene subunit with the aim of shifting the absorption wavelength of open (&#955;max,UV) and closed forms (&#955;max,Vis). A 5&#8208;uridine&#8208;2&#8208;thiophene connection (semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes) resulted in a red shift of &#955;max,UV and blue shift of &#955;max,Vis. Resulting switches showed remarkable reversibility and fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs&#8211;semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96&#8201;% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.

         <title>What Determines the Lewis Acidity of a Bismuthane? Towards Bi&#8208;Based FLPs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures and reactivities of (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiX2 (X=Cl, I, C2F5) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. It turned out that the construction of functional Lewis acidic sites based on neutral bismuthanes requires substituents with a high ionic character and electronegativity, and at the same time they should not contain atoms in &#945;&#8208;position or lone pairs that are capable of undergoing effective negative hyperconjugation.







Abstract
Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8722;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital.

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple model to explain the preferred geometry for tricoordinate pnictogen pincer complexes is proposed based on competing &#960; and &#963; effects to make sense of the variable structures reported in the literature. This model is supported by density functional theory calculations of more than 1300 structures, determining the energy of 64 compounds spanning geometries from planar to pyramidal.







Abstract
Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium incorporation onto already electron&#8208;deficient benzene diimides is demonstrated here. In the solid state, these compounds engage in interesting anion&#8211;&#960; interactions and H&#8722;bonding patterns. Injection of electrons is facile (ca. &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) and results in species with NIR absorption maxima (&#955;max up to 821&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8211;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8211;water H&#8722;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Properties of Bridged Dithienyl&#8208;, Difuryl&#8208;, Dipyrrolyl&#8208;Vinylene as Precursors of Small&#8208;Bandgap Conjugated Polymer.</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel series of vinylene bridged heteroaryls is presented and studied by computational methods. Calculated structural and optoelectronic properties are discussed in order to identify viable molecular designs. Notably, one candidate exhibits a narrow band gap, longer absorption wavelengths, low BLA and reorganization energy. These findings suggest its potential use as a precursor of advanced conjugated materials for organic electronics.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers are of great importance for the fabrication of organic photonic and electronic devices. To this end, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers need to meet both optoelectronic and key structural properties in order to fulfill their implementation as active components. In particular, they need to possess low bandgap and high thermal, conformational, and photochemical stabilities. So far, several strategies have been developed to attain such requirements including the covalent and non&#8208;covalent rigidification concepts of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. On the basis of these findings, we describe herein the theoretical studies of novel series of covalently bridged derivatives demonstrating the benefits of the strategy. Comparison of these derivatives with compounds previously described in the literature highlights enhanced optoelectronic properties and behaviors that would be beneficial for the construction and development of new linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligands: Evaluating the Role of Acidic Protons in the Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ancillary NH groups contained within ligands can participate in reactions through metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. Substitution of the NH moiety by NMe or O can be used in the evaluation of its role. This study investigates how such substitutions also affect the electronics and the binding strengths of the ligand.







Abstract
To evaluate bifunctional ligand reactivity involving NH acidic sites in the secondary coordination sphere, complexes where the proton has been substituted with a methyl group (NMe) are often investigated. An alternative strategy involves substitution of the NH group for an O. This contribution considers and compares the merits of these approaches; the synthesis and characterization of cationic square&#8208;planar Rh carbonyl complexes bearing diprotic bispyrazole pyridine ligand L1, and the bis&#8208;methylated pyrazole pyridine ligand L1Me are described. The syntheses and characterization of the novel monoprotic pyrazole isoxazole pyridine ligand L2 and aprotic bisisoxazole pyridine ligand L3, and their corresponding Rh carbonyl complexes are also described. Comparison of the CO stretching frequencies of the four Rh complexes suggest that substitutions of NH with NMe, as well as with O, lead to significant electronic differences. These electronic differences result in different reactivities with respect to ligand addition/substitution of the Rh carbonyl complexes. Overall, the data suggest that electronic differences arising due to the NH substitutions can be significant and should be considered when the NH group is substituted in investigations of the participation of the NH proton in a reaction.

         <title>Merging of a Supramolecular Ligand with a Switchable Luminophore &#8211; Light&#8208;Responsiveness, Photophysics and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission is reported. The design concept is based on merging of cyanostilbenes with guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrroles yielding hybrid luminophores, capable to undergo photoisomerization and are able to be used in biomedical imaging.







Abstract
In this contribution we report on a novel approach towards luminescent light&#8208;responsive ligands. To this end, cyanostilbene&#8208; guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole hybrids were designed and investigated. Merging of a luminophore with a supramolecular bioactive ligand bears numerous advantages by overcoming the typical drawbacks of drug&#8208;labelling, influencing the overall performance of the active species by attachment of a large luminophore. Here we were able to establish a simple and easily accessible synthesis route to different cyanostyryl&#8208;guanidininiocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (CGCP) derivatives. These compounds were investigated regarding their light&#8208;responsive double bond isomerisation, their molecular structures in single crystals by means of X&#8208;ray diffractometry, their emission properties by state of the art photophysical characterisation as well as bioimaging and assessment of cell toxicity.

         <title>Formation and Stability of Benzylic&#160;Amide&#160;[2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes: an Intercomponent Interactions Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most recent focuses in supramolecular chemistry is developing molecules designed to exhibit programmable properties at the molecular level. Rotaxanes, which function as molecular machines with movements controlled by external stimuli, are prime candidates for this purpose. However, the controlled synthesis of rotaxanes, especially amide&#8208;benzylic rotaxanes with more than two components, remains an area ripe for exploration. In this study, we aim to elucidate the formation of amide&#8208;benzylic [3]rotaxanes using a thread that includes a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. Including the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station introduces new perspectives into the chemistry of rotaxanes, influencing their conformation and dynamics. The synthesis of two&#8208;station rotaxanes with varying stoppers demonstrated that the macrocycle consistently occupies the succinamide station, providing greater stability as evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The presence of a triazole&#8208;carbonyl station facilitated the formation of a second macrocycle exclusively when a secondary amide was employed as the stopper group, presumably due to decreased steric hindrance. Moreover, the second macrocycle directly forms at the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. This investigation reveals that slight modifications in the thread structure can dramatically impact the formation, stability, and interactions between components of rotaxanes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Applying electricity as a reagent in synthetic organic chemistry has attracted particular attention from synthetic chemists worldwide as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective technique. Herein, we report the construction of the Csp2&#8208;Csp2 linkage at the C5&#8208;C5&#8242; position of 2&#8208;oxindole utilizing electricity as the traceless oxidant in an anodic dehydrogenative homo&#8208;coupling process. A variety of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles were subjected to dimerization, achieving yields of up to 70% through controlled potential electrolysis at an applied potential of 1.5 V versus Ag/Ag+ nonaqueous reference electrode. This electro&#8208;synthetic approach facilitates the specific assembly of C5&#8208;C5&#8242; (para&#8208;para coupled) dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole without the necessity of any external oxidants or additives and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations provided confirmation of this pronounced regioselectivity. Furthermore, validation through control experiments and voltammetric analyses substantiated the manifestation of radical&#8208;radical coupling (or biradical pathway) for the dimerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Aryl Ketones Involving Free Phenolic Hydroxyl Group(s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward asymmetric transfer hydrogenation for accessing enantiomerically enriched secondary benzyl alcohols involving free phenolic hydroxyl group(s) under mild conditions was developed. Various of optical pure aryl alcohols with a remarkable functional group compatibility were achieved with 78%&#8211;97% yields, 84%&#8211;&gt;99% ee&#8217;s and up to 10 000 TON. This rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction could be performed in a gram&#8208;scale without loss of the efficiency. Furthermore, the synthetic utility has also been demonstrated in the asymmetric synthesis of (S)&#8208;adrenaline and (S)&#8208;phenylephrine.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Hyperconjugation and Hydrogen Bonding on the Conformers of Methylated Monosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational landscapes of four 1&#8208;O&#8208;methylated monosaccharides&#8212;methyl a&#8208;glucose, methyl b&#8208;glucose, methyl a&#8208;galactose, and methyl b&#8208;galactose&#8212;were characterized using jet&#8208;cooled broadband rotational spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations. A newly designed, simple pulsed nozzle assembly was used to introduced the sugar samples into a jet expansion without thermal degradation, eliminating the need for a complex and expensive laser ablation system. Ten conformers were experimentally identified by assigning their rotational spectra, and the intricate methyl internal rotation splittings were analysed. Notably, methylation alters the directionality of intramolecular hydrogen bonding of a&#8208;galactose highlighting its impact on structural preference. Natural bond orbital, intrinsic bond strength, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses were conducted to explore the interplay between hydrogen bonding and hyperconjugation. A set of &#963; to &#963;* neutral hyperconjugative interactions were found to override a strong hydrogen bond, driving a preference for the gauche conformers.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cannabidiol (CBD) is garnering increasing interest due to its significant biological activity. This natural compound is one of the major cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa L. In this work, we describe the encapsulation of CBD in solid and hollow pH&#8208;sensitive poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (solid@p4VP and hollow@p4VP) nanoparticles, and temperature&#8208;sensitive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (solid@pNIPAM and hollow@pNIPAM) nanoparticles for transport and release CBD in a controlled manner. The CBD loading into these smart polymeric systems was effective and their release profiles, solubility and resistance to stomach and intestinal conditions were evaluated, showing satisfactory properties and improved bioavailability with respect to free CBD. Finally, the A549 human lung cancer cell line was used as lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cellular model to carry out preliminary assays of the in vitro activity of the vehiculized CBD. For all these studies, synthetic CBD was employed, for which a new efficient and scalable synthesis of cannabinoids has been developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Alkynyl Ketones and Amides to Generate Unsaturated Oxacycles and Aromatic Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe novel amine&#8208;mediated transformation of alkynyl ketones and amides to generate 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans, substituted 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ones, and amine&#8208;incorporated arenes. These cascade processes are initiated by conjugate addition of secondary amine followed by hydrolysis of the enamine/vinylogous amide intermediates. The product distribution is highly sensitive to the steric and electronic effects of the substituents on both the alkyne moieties, the tether structure connecting them, and the nature of the amine. Alkynyl amide participates in the Alder&#8208;ene reaction favorably to generate more reactive allene amide that reacts with amine to generate amine&#8208;incorporated arene products. These metal&#8208;free cascade reactions are a useful synthetic method that can be exploited for the construction of various hetero&#8208; and carbocyclic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Divergent Synthesis of a 13&#8208;Ring Triquinone and its Facile Conversion to a [4.4.4]Tridecastarphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes are notable for their optoelectronic properties. Starphenes are structurally related molecules possessing three acene arms that radiate linearly from a central benzene ring (i.e., linearly annellated triphenylenes). Large starphenes have been prepared using convergent syntheses involving transition metal catalyzed cyclotrimerizations of either preformed acenes or arynes. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot divergent synthesis of a 13&#8208;ring triquinone that readily converts to a [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative. The one&#8208;pot procedure involves the sequential reactions of three 1,4&#8208;anthraquinones with o&#173;&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives that are generated sequentially from a trisulfone precursor. The resulting [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative bearing p&#8208;(t&#8208;butyl)phenyl substituents was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry,&#160;differential pulse voltammetry and DFT calculations. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal a relatively high&#8208;lying HOMO orbital (about &#8208;4.70 to &#8208;4.86 eV) and a relatively small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.1 eV), suggesting utility as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene photooxidizes in CH2Cl2 solution exposed to ambient light and air with a half&#8208;life of 150 minutes at room temperature, but shows no sign of degradation after 12 months in the solid&#8208;state. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene shows excellent solubility in various organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and toluene, potentially enabling printed electronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;induced three&#8208;component reaction for the construction of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acid derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs), which are pivotal components in natural metabolism and pharmaceutical innovation, continues to attract significant research interest. Despite substantial advancements, the pursuit of a facile, versatile, and resource&#8208;efficient methodology remains an area of active development. In this work, we introduce a visible light&#8208;triggered three&#8208;component reaction involving readily available nitrosoarenes, N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles, and allyl or (bromomethyl)benzenes under mild conditions. This approach enables the straightforward assembly of a wide array of ATAA derivatives (41 examples) in commendably high yields (up to 89%). Mechanistic investigations elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a dehydration condensation between nitrosoarenes and N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles to generate ketimine intermediates. This is followed by a light&#8208;driven halogen atom transfer (XAT) process and a radical addition, culminating in the formation of the desired products. The approach showcases excellent functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage derivatization potential, offering new insights and avenues for the synthesis of ATAA analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Deoxycyclophellitols as Human Retaining &#946;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophellitol is a potent and selective mechanism&#8208;based retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor that has served as a versatile starting point for the development of activity&#8208;based glycosidase probes (ABPs). We developed routes of synthesis of eight mono&#8208; and dideoxycyclophellitols and cyclophellitol aziridines, the latter as ABPs carrying either a biotin or fluorophore linked to the aziridine nitrogen. We reveal the potency of these 24 compounds as inhibitors of the three human retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases, GBA1, GBA2 and GBA3. We show that 3,6&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galacto&#8208;cyclophellitol aziridine selectively captures GBA3 over GBA1 and GBA2 in extracts of cells overexpressing both GBA2 and GBA3. We also identify a probe that selectively labels GBA1 and GBA2 over GBA3 at lower concentrations. In sum, the here&#8208;presented studies reveal new chemistries to prepare chiral, substituted cyclitol epoxides and aziridines, add to the growing suite of cyclophellitols varying in configuration and substitution pattern, and yielded a reagent that may find use to investigate the physiological role and therapeutic relevance of the most elusive of the three retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases: GBA3.</dc:description>

         <title>Migration of para&#8208;Nitrophenyl Groups in Methyl Pyranosides: Configuration and Conformation Determine the Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>para&#8208;Nitrophenyl (PNP) ethers of glycosides are important building blocks en route to functional carbohydrates. They are stable in neutral media, however, under basic conditions such as during the Zempl&#233;n deacylation of sugars, aryl migration is frequently observed. We have employed a library of O&#8208;PNP&#8208;substituted methyl glycosides of the manno&#8208;, galacto&#8208;, gluco&#8208; and altro&#8208;series to study the kinetics of aryl migration in MeOH/sodium methoxide using NMR spectroscopy revealing that migration between cis&#8208;oriented OH groups is faster than between trans&#8208;oriented ones. The rate constants of migration decrease in the order of Alt &gt; Man &gt; Gal &gt; Glc and are related to the energy barriers of chair conformation inversion. The energy profile of the 3 to 4&#8208;PNP migration in methyl mannoside was calculated using DFT methods suggesting the Meisenheimer complex is an intermediate of PNP migration and that coordination of the sodium cation has a major impact on the energy profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Optical Property of [6]Cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot procedure with cobalt&#8208;mediated oxidation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl by ferrocenium salts afforded the chiral cyclic hexamer of naphthylene, [6]cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene (1). The molecular structure of 1 was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR analyses, revealing its cyclic structure with an approximate D3 symmetry. Compound 1 exhibits blue emission at 383 nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which can be attributed to its rigid twelve&#8208;membered ring structure. Optical resolution of 1 by chiral HPLC allowed for the evaluation of its chiroptical properties. Each enantiomer exhibits circular dichroism with complex Cotton effects, which are grouped into three positive or three negative couplets. Circularly polarized luminescence is observed at 383 nm with an anisotropy factor |glum| on the order of 10&#8211;4. The high photoluminescence quantum yield and the CPL properties of 1 indicate its potential application as a CPL emitter.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The utilization of axially chiral biaryl diamines has been widely acknowledged as highly advantageous structures for the advancement of chiral catalysts and ligands. This highlights their extensive range of applications in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis. Herein, we devised a direct arylation reactions of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with azonaphthalenes, utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as the catalyst. This method delivers structurally novel atroposelective N, N&#8208;1,2&#8208;azole heteroaryl diamines with high yields (up to &gt;98%) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios while exhibiting a wide range of substrate compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Noncovalent Interaction Strengths of Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Using Negative Ion Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are crucial for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes, which have wide&#8208;ranging implications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science. However, since NCIs are relatively weak and sensitive to bulk perturbation, direct and accurate measurement of their absolute strength has always been a significant challenge. This concept article aims to demonstrate the gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization (ESI)&#8208;negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) as a direct and precise technique to measure the absolute interaction strength, probe nature of NCIs, and reveal the electronic structural information for host&#8208;guest complexes. Our recent studies in investigating various host&#8208;guest complexes that involve various types of NCIs such as anion&#8211;&#960;, (di)hydrogen bonding, charge&#8208;separated ionic interactions, are overviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided for this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancements in &#960;&#8208;Magnetism and Precision Engineering of Carbon&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of &#960;&#8208;magnetism in low&#8208;dimensional carbon&#8208;based nanostructures, such as nanographenes (NGs), has captured significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in spintronics and quantum technologies. Recent advancements in on&#8208;surface synthesis under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions have enabled the atomically precise engineering of these nanostructures, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by their inherent strong chemical reactivity. This review highlights the essential concepts and synthesis methodologies used in studying NGs. It also outlines the remarkable progress made in understanding and controlling their magnetic properties.

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: On the Role of Local Charge Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular simulation models unravel the local charge profile of substrate&#8208;supported nanoparticles in contact to ionic liquid molecules &#8211; thus providing structural and electronic insights to nanosystems used in (electro&#8722;)catalyses. While quantum approaches are limited to comparably small systems, we demonstrate the application of the QEq method for bridging time and length scales significantly. This enables molecular simulation studies for exploring the self&#8208;organization of ionic liquid and reactant molecules on supported nanoparticle models.







Abstract
Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10&#8197;nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8722;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Selective Fluorescence Sensing of Mg2+ and Al3+ Ions by Pincer&#8208;Type NNO Schiff Base Ligand: An Experimental and DFT Optimized Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A newly developed dual&#8208;functional fluorescence sensing probe (phenylhydrazinyl pyridine) Schiff base (SB) has been designed with good selectivity for distinguishing Mg2+ and Al3+ metal ions in different solvent solutions. SB exhibits quick and visual turn&#8208;on fluorescence enhancement in response to Mg2+ and Al3+ detection. The addition of Mg2+ in ACN&#8211;HEPES buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.2) at (&#955;max = 390 nm) and&#160;Al3+ in MeOH&#8211;HEPES buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.2) at &#160;(&#955;max = 360 nm) resulted in significant enhancement of fluorescence, up to 7 &#8208; 9 times. These low detection limits of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8208;6 M (7.1 &#956;M) and 5.15 &#215; 10&#8208;7 M (0.51 &#956;M) for Mg2+ and Al3+, respectively, have been achieved by this solvent&#8208;controlled platform. Due to the sensing potential towards Mg2+, the probe was utilized as an imaging material for breast cancer cells. 1H&#8208;NMR studies were utilized to explore SB's sensing mechanism through turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to validate optimized SB and its intricate geometries, which govern the sensing mechanism in the solvent environment. Such a probe has extensive potential applications in bioimaging and the assessment of the quality of wastewater.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Functional Applications of Precision Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing precision polymers using four methods &#8211; solid&#8208;phase synthesis, liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, DNA&#8208;template synthesis, and controlled polymerization &#8211; precision polymers with special properties in thermodynamics and crystalline performance have been achieved. These polymers play important roles in fields such as self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage and encryption, imaging, and therapy, among others.







Abstract
In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science &#8211; a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.

         <title>Sulfonamide&#8208;Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine&#8208;Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the ongoing search for a cheap and fluorine&#8208;free alternative for perfluorinated sulfonic acid&#8208;polymers (PFSAs), we investigate a set of novel copolymers combining sulfonamide and sulfonimide functionalities. The materials show outstanding conductivities of up to 283&#8197;mS&#8201;c&#8722;1, high thermal stability over 250&#8201;&#176;C and easy manufacturing. On top they contain many possibilities for variation, giving them promising prospects as a new class of ionomers.







Abstract
In this work, a novel type of fluorine&#8208;lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide&#8208;sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost&#8208;efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end&#8208;groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4&#8208;fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from Tg=151&#8201;&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#8201;&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non&#8208;swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963;=283&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems. This approach can pave the way to a novel type of ion conducting class in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

         <title>In situ Reconstructured Alloy Nanosheets Heterojunction for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ reconstruction process fabricates the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction while preserving the two&#8208;dimensional morphology. The synergistic effect of Cu and Sn active sites stabilizes the *OCHO intermediate, thereby facilitating efficient electrocatalytic formate production. The designed Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction demonstrates outstanding CO2RR performance, showcasing its potential for practical applications in sustainable energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu&#8322;O@Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; heterojunction. Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu&#8322;O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

The designed Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O@Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction demonstrates outstanding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance, showcasing its potential for practical applications in sustainable energy conversion and storage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin (Sn)-based materials are expected to realize efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu-doped SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O@Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; while maintaining its two-dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu&#8322;O@Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; heterojunction. Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu&#8322;O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Effective Strategy on Synthesizing a Stable SiOx&#8208;Based Anode for High Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium fluoride (LiF) serves as a modified additive, which can enhance the electrochemical performance in SiOx anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we demonstrate a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with LiF modified. The addition of LiF can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase layer, reduce the volume expansion, and enhance the Li+ diffusion coefficient.







Abstract
Silicon oxides (SiOx) have received extensive attention as a promising anode candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their commercial applications have been seriously hindered by low conductivity, large volume expansion, and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which result in low initial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance, and short cycling lifespan. In this work, we demonstrated a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with lithium fluoride (LiF) modified. When the mass ratio of SiOx and LiF equaled 1&#8201;:&#8201;0.15, the long&#8208;term cycling capacity retention could be greatly improved from 30.1&#8201;% to 76.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. The result was primarily because of the enhancement of electrons and Li+&#8208;ions transport and the stability of the SEI layer due to LiF addition. However, excess LiF addition could hinder the diffusion of Li+&#8208;ions. This study presented the great potential of LiF modified on SiOx anode materials for LIBs.

         <title>Bipyramidal Nanocrystals of Noble Metals: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers bipyramidal nanocrystals of noble metals, with a focus on the roles played by reduction, etching, and capping in their nucleation and growth. It also discusses how to control the exposed facets, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation, as well as their effects on plasmonic properties and catalytic applications.







Abstract
Shape control has been a major theme of nanocrystal research in terms of synthesis, property tailoring, and optimization of performance in a variety of applications. Among the possible shapes, bipyramids are unique owing to their symmetry, planar defects, and exposed facets. In this article, we focus on the colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals featuring a triangular bipyramidal shape, together with highlights of their properties and applications. We start with a brief discussion of the general classification and requirements for the nucleation and growth of bipyramidal nanocrystals, followed by specific aspects regarding the synthetic methods with a focus on the roles of reduction, etching, and capping, as well as controls of facet, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation. In the end, we illustrate how these aspects affect the properties of bipyramidal nanocrystals for plasmonic and catalytic applications, together with future perspectives.

         <title>Benzodifuranone Crystals with Solid&#8208;State Emission Arising from the Introduction of Bulky Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved benzodifuranone crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission achieved through the introduction of bulky aromatic groups. In addition to the unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.







Abstract
Benzodifuranone derivatives, structural analogues of widely studied diketopyrrolopyrrole, have been reported to show photoluminescence exclusively in solution states. Here, upon introducing bulky aromatic groups into benzodifuranone dyes, crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission were obtained. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the emissive properties should most likely be attributed to the absence of stacking between the dye scaffolds. In addition to the solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed responsivity to external stimuli, i.&#8201;e., luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.

         <title>50 Years of Organoselenium Chemistry, Biochemistry and Reactivity: Mechanistic Understanding, Successful and Controversial Stories</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 1973, two major discoveries changed the face of selenium chemistry: the identification of the first mammal selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, and the discovery of the synthetic utility of the so&#8208;called selenoxide elimination.&#160; While the chemical mechanism behind the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases appears to be mostly unveiled, little is known about the mechanisms of other selenoproteins and, for some of them, even the function lies in the dark. In chemistry, the capacity of organoselenides of catalyzing hydrogen peroxide activation for the practical manipulation of organic functional groups has been largely explored, and some mechanistic details have been clearly elucidated. As a paradox, despite the long&#8208;standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non&#8208;toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted. In this review, some fundamental and chronologically aligned topics spanning organoselenium biochemistry, chemistry and pharmacology are discussed, focusing on the current mechanistic picture describing their activity as either bioactive compounds or catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl derivatives has been realized under photoelectrochemical conditions in the presence of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as the homogeneous photocatalyst. The protocol can be applied to both primary and secondary, benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The desired products are obtained selectively, skipping the need for purposely added chemical oxidants. An in&#8208;depth study of photoelectrochemical conditions revealed that the protocol works best under amperostatic conditions in an undivided electrochemical cell irradiated with a 390 nm LED lamp. The comparison with analogous electrochemical and chemical oxidant&#8208;promoted photocatalytic oxidations demonstrates the superior efficiency and selectivity of the hereby reported photoelectrochemical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Potent Antiviral Activity of the Sesterterpenoids from the Sponge Ircinia felix against Human Adenoviruses: from the Natural Source to the Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients can result in disseminated diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the absence of available treatments for these infections.&#160;Ircinia felix&#160;sponge was selected for the significant anti&#8208;HAdV activity displayed by its organic extracts. Its chemical analysis yielded three&#160;novel sesterterpene lactams, ircinialactams J&#8208;L, along with three known sesterterpene furans&#160;which structures&#160;were established by a deep spectrometric analysis. Ircinialactam J displayed significant antiviral activity against HAdV without significant cytotoxicity, showing an effectiveness 11 times greater than that of the standard treatment, cidofovir&#174;. Some structure&#8208;activity relationships were deduced. Mechanistic assays suggest that ircinialactam J&#160;targets an early step of the HAdV replicative cycle before HAdV genome reaches the nucleus of the host cell.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients can result in disseminated diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the absence of available treatments for these infections.&#160;Ircinia felix&#160;sponge was selected for the significant anti-HAdV activity displayed by its organic extracts. Its chemical analysis yielded three&#160;novel sesterterpene lactams, ircinialactams J-L, along with three known sesterterpene furans&#160;which structures&#160;were established by a deep spectrometric analysis. Ircinialactam J displayed significant antiviral activity against HAdV without significant cytotoxicity, showing an effectiveness 11 times greater than that of the standard treatment, cidofovir&#174;. Some structure-activity relationships were deduced.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group (FG) is one of the cornerstone concepts in organic chemistry and related areas. The wide spread of bioisosterism ideas in medicinal chemistry and beyond caused a striking rise in demand for novel FGs with a defined impact on the developed compound properties. In this work, the evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;difluorooxetane unit (3,3&#8208;diFox) as a functional group for bioisosteric replacements is disclosed. A comprehensive experimental study (including multigram building block synthesis, quantification of steric and electronic properties, measurements of pKa, LogP, chemical stability, and biological evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;diFox&#8208;derived bioisostere of a drug candidate) revealed a prominent behavior of the 3,3&#8208;diFox fragment as a versatile substituent for early drug discovery programs.</dc:description>

         <title>The fabrication of ZIF&#8208;L derived ZnS/MoS2@NC anode materials for remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement of electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries can be achieved through the incorporation of MoS2 with carbon materials and various metal sulfides. In this investigation, a MoS2/ZnS heterostructure was devised incorporating a two&#8208;dimensional nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (NC) backbone. The synthesis of ZnMo&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L precursors was achieved by introducing a Mo source in a 1:1 molar ratio during ZIF&#8208;L synthesis. Subsequent to high&#8208;temperature carbonization and vulcanization treatment, ZnS/MoS2@NC composite materials were successfully synthesized. Compared to the unvulcanized ZnO/MoO3@NC and MoS2 samples, the ZnS/MoS2@NC composite exhibits remarkable lithium storage performance. At a current density of 500 mA g&#8208;1, the initial discharge specific capacity is 2547 mAh g&#8208;1, with an initial charge specific capacity of 1674 mAh g&#8208;1, resulting in a first Coulombic efficiency of 65.76%. Furthermore, this composite material demonstrates optimal rate capabilities and a significant pseudocapacitance contribution. The nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon framework effectively mitigates volume effects, while the heterostructural design provides more active sites for lithium ions, thereby enhancing lithium storage performance.</dc:description>

         <title>100 &#956;s Luminescence Lifetime Boosts the Excited State Reactivity of a Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Anthracene Complex in Photon Upconversion and Photocatalytic Polymerizations with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The triplet excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer is an essential parameter for diffusion&#8208;controlled energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer, which occurs usually in a competitive manner to the intrinsic decay of a triplet excited state. Here we show the decisive role of luminescence lifetime in the triplet excited state reactivity toward energy&#8208; and electron transfer. Anchoring two phenyl anthracene chromophores to a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex (RuII ref) leads to a RuII triad with a luminescence lifetime above 100 &#956;s, which is more than 40 times longer than that of the prototypical complex. The obtained RuII triad sensitizes energy transfer to anthracene&#8208;based annihilators more efficiently than the RuII ref and enables red&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion with a pseudo anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.94 eV and a moderate upconversion efficiency near 1% in aerated solution. Particularly, the RuII triad allows rapid photoredox catalytic polymerizations of acrylate and acrylamide monomers under aerobic condition with red light, which are kinetically hindered for the RuII ref. Our work shows that excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer governs the dynamics of the excited state reactions, which seems an overlooked but important aspect for photochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>IPr*F &#8211; Highly Hindered, Fluorinated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atom has attracted considerable interest in molecular design owing to the high electronegativity and the resulting polarization of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds. Simultaneously, sterically&#8208;hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to high stabilization of the reactive metal centers, which has paved the way for the synthesis of stable and reactive organometallic compounds with broad applications in main group chemistry, inorganic synthesis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis. Herein, we report the first class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These ligands feature variable fluorine substitution at the N&#8208;aromatic wingtip, permitting to rationally vary steric and electronic characteristics of the carbene center imparted by the fluorine atom. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. The evaluation of steric, electron&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties as well as coordination chemistry to Au(I), Rh(I) and Se is presented. Considering the unique properties of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds, we anticipate that this novel class of fluorinated carbene ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nonribosomal Peptides Chitinimides Reveal a Special Type of Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and their tailored enzymes have diverse biological functions. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis and function of chitinimides, which belong to the non&#8208;ribosomal peptide (NRP) subfamily featuring a pyrrolidine&#8208;containing part (X part) connected to the polypeptide chain via an ester bond. A conserved gene cassette, chmHIJK, is responsible for oxyacylation of the pyrrolidine moiety in the X part. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ChmC (ChmC&#8208;TE) catalyzes transesterification reactions with a free X part or methanol as a nucleophilic reagent to form different chitinimides. The crucial amino acid residues in the ChmC&#8208;TE domains responsible for the specific recognition of the X part were identified, and they were conserved in all the biosynthetic pathways of this NRP subfamily to form a signature motif, YNHNR, suggesting a special type of TE domain in NRPSs. Chitinimides demonstrate the biological function of promoting the swarming ability of the native producer. This study provides deep insights into the biosynthesis of this special NRP subfamily, and shows that the special TE domain could be used to generate diverse NRPs by combinatorial biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein some experimental results, including NMR and x&#8208;ray, which have led to the recent retraction of a Nature Communications article claiming to feature a metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling of primary amides with amines under the action of a hypervalent iodine oxidant. These findings should help the chemical research community to avoid such pitfalls in the future.







Abstract
The oxidative formation of N&#8722;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and co&#8208;authors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8722;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.

         <title>Discovering of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters by High&#8208;Throughput Syntheses Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a high&#8208;throughput metal nanocluster synthesis method assisted by machine learning, which can accelerate the discovery of nanoclusters, improve the synthesis efficiency, and successfully form a series of nanoclusters (i.&#8201;e., Au41Cu66, Au40Cu34, Au18Cu32, Au18, Au6Cu6, Cu&#8722;NC nanoclusters). This study further reinforces the importance of high&#8208;throughput screening in advancing the field of nanocluster research.







Abstract
Understanding the complete structure of noble metal nanoclusters is both academically and practically significant. However, progress has been hindered by the low synthetic efficiency of many nanocluster syntheses. In this study, we present the first high&#8208;throughput syntheses of homo&#8208;gold, homo&#8208;copper, and gold&#8208;copper alloy nanoclusters in dichloromethane at room temperature. Through high&#8208;throughput screening, we successfully obtained three nanoclusters in a single reaction: Au18(SC6H11)14, [Au41Cu66(SC6H11)44](SbF6)3, and an unidentified copper cluster (referred to as Au18, Au41Cu66, and Cu&#8722;NC). The optimized synthesis route was achieved with the assistance of machine learning for experimental data analysis, which also guided the synthesis of other metal nanoclusters such as Au40Cu34(4&#8208;S&#8208;PhF)40 (Au40Cu34), [Au6Cu6(SPh)12]n ([Au6Cu6]n), and Au18Cu32(3,5&#8208;C8H9S)36 (Au18Cu32)). This research demonstrates that high&#8208;throughput screening can be a valuable tool in accelerating the development of nanocluster syntheses.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable, Eight&#8208;electron Acceptor Drives Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Assisted Tunable Ionic Self&#8208;Assembly and Proton Conduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient, water&#8208;stable, eight&#8208;electron acceptor scaffold has been used as a platform to realize proton conduction through ionic self&#8208;assembly. In this unique self&#8208;assembled material, 1D water tapes are revealed, that undergo hydrogen&#8208;bonding with halide anions, thereby generating a pathway for anion&#8208;assisted, tunable proton conduction.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;scaffolds are being envisaged for new&#8208;age electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron&#8208;deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water&#8208;stable core&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;viologen based tetra&#8208;cation, which accumulates up to eight&#8208;electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05&#8197;V and &#8722;1.12&#8197;V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.&#8201;g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H&#8208;bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water&#8208;tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen&#8208;bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6&#8722; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron&#8208;deficient, eight&#8208;electron acceptor, water&#8208;stable ionic supramolecular system.

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Octopus and the CLICK Procedure in Columnar Liquid Crystal Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>

Molecular Octopus: A donor&#8208;acceptor discotic star mesogen based on a porphyrin core, bithiophene arms and decorated with four fullerenes attached via spacer forms porphyrin J&#8208;type aggregates by porphyrin&#8208;fullerene supramolecular interactions. Mixed with a complementary star providing intrinsic free space between the conjugated scaffold, the fullerenes fall into the void and assemble in completely different columnar aggregates.







Abstract
Two star&#8208;shaped mesogens with a (meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato) zinc (II) core and bithiophene conjugated arms with 3,4,5&#8208;trisdodecyloxyphenyl periphery were synthesized. One of these molecules was decorated with four fullerenes via an aliphatic spacer. This is the sterically overcrowded compound with an octapodal morphology. The other star lacks the fullerenes and provides free space between the conjugated arms. This mesogen does not aggregate in solution, but in solid state it forms a hexagonal columnar and a highly ordered oblique helical columnar phase, while the octopus molecule assembles in an amorphous solid. Photophysical studies of the octapodal compound in solution and the solid thin film reveal the formation of J&#8208;type aggregates, in which the interaction between donors (porphyrin) and acceptors (fullerene) dominates leading to absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectra. The mixture of both compounds results in a self&#8208;assembly which is called the Click procedure. Fullerenes of the octopus nanosegregate in the pockets of the star mesogens generating hexagonal columnar structures with a regular stacking along the columnar axis. Thus providing free space is a tool to control the competition between supramolecular interactions and nanosegregation. Such liquid&#8208;crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor structures may play a role in future LC photovoltaic applications.

A photoinduced energy transfer enabled procedure for the construction of otherwise challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access polycyclic sultine derivatives has been discovered. The reaction demonstrates good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, excellent diastereoselectivity, and scalable.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated energy&#8208;transfer enabled radical cyclization for the divergent synthesis of polycyclic &#947;&#8208;sultine derivatives has been developed. The reaction provides an alternative and expeditious access to benzofused &#947;&#8208;sultine frameworks, the analogues of &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#947;&#8208;sultones, and features good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions and excellent diastereoselectivity. The robustness and application potential of this method have also been successfully displayed by two gram&#8208;scale reactions and the synthesis of polycyclic sultones. Mechanistic studies indicated the transformations through a possible energy&#8208;transfer enabled intramolecular radical homolytic substitution or hydrogen atom transfer process mainly.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exobiotic self&#8208;replication: When sulfur is positioned between the two nitrogens of benzothiadiazole, it can engage in edge&#8208;on molecular recognition events. We present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system based on this interaction, and evidence for autocatalysis. The designs have implications for exobiology, due to their cosmic similarities and potential for genetic capacity.







Abstract
Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life's existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge &#8211; especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA's hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.

         <title>DNA Hierarchical Superstructures from Micellar Units: Stiff Hydrogels and Anisotropic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using three different orthogonal interactions &#8211; hydrophobic effect, RNA kissing loops, DNA base pairing &#8211; we created hierarchical nanostructures from precise DNA amphiphiles. These micron&#8208;sized materials are controlled by the nanoscale structure of the self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles with sequence&#8208;dependent behavior and have found applications as self&#8208;healing hydrogels. This bottom&#8208;up approach opens new avenues towards novel DNA hybrid materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular materials have been assembled using a wide range of interactions, including the hydrophobic effect, DNA base&#8208;pairing, and hydrogen bonding. Specifically, DNA amphiphiles with a hydrophobic building block self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies depending on the length and composition of both blocks. Herein, we take advantage of the orthogonality of different supramolecular interactions &#8211; the hydrophobic effect, Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;Franklin base pairing and RNA kissing loops &#8211; to create hierarchical self&#8208;assemblies with controlled morphologies on both the nanometer and the micrometer scales. Assembly through base&#8208;pairing leads to the formation of hybrid, multi&#8208;phasic hydrogels with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties. Assembly via hydrophobic core interactions gives anisotropic, discrete assemblies, where DNA fibers with one sequence are terminated with DNA spheres bearing different sequences. This work opens new avenues for the bottom&#8208;up construction of DNA&#8208;based materials, with promising applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the creation of complex DNA structures from a minimum array of components.

         <title>Luminescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Flexible Lewis Pair Ligands: Spectroscopic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of platinum(II) complexes containing stimuli&#8208;responsive Flexible Lewis Pair (FlexLP) ligands were synthesized and characterized. The photophysical properties of the complexes have been studied using spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations. The results show that these complexes exhibit readily tunable fluorescence and triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime that can be controlled by the solvent and peripheral ligands on the platinum(II) centers.







Abstract
A series of new luminescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes with stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible Lewis pair (FlexLP) ligands are described. The FlexLP ligands consist of a dimesitylboron Lewis acid and diphenylphosphine oxide Lewis base which are in equilibrium between the unbound open form and the Lewis adduct, controlled by the hydrogen bond donating strength of the solvent. Spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to interpret the photophysics of the platinum(II) complexes. All complexes exhibit tunable absorption in the region of 300&#8211;500&#8197;nm and green to orange photoluminescence, depending on the ratio of weak (THF) to strong (MeOH) hydrogen bond donating solvent employed. Spectroscopic and computational data shows that phosphine and peripheral acetylide ligands on the platinum(II) centers have limited influence on the emission energy, indicating the emission originates from the FlexLP&#8208;dominated fluorescence. Using time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy it is shown that the complexes undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet excited state upon photoexcitation, and the ISC efficiency is affected by the peripheral acetylide ligands. The triplet excited state lifetime can also be manipulated by the state of the FlexLP ligand, with the closed form complexes having longer lifetimes than the open form complexes.

         <title>Investigating the Mechanism of Triboluminescence: Insights from Structural and Electrostatic Characterization of Copper Thiocyanate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of oppositely charged pairs, followed by their recombination to exhibit triboluminescence upon disrupting intermolecular interactions during mechanical fracture of crystal, was characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations. This study elucidated the crucial role of charge separation in triboluminescence and enabled its activation and deactivation through molecular network design.







Abstract
Triboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated through mechanical stress; it has emerging applications in stress&#8208;sensing devices. Although the prevailing mechanistic model indicates that light emits from charge separation and recombination in fracture planes arising from polar structures, its application in designing triboluminescent materials remains limited owing to numerous exceptions. This study provides insights into the essential requirements for triboluminescence by investigating the structural and electrostatic properties of fractured crystals of copper thiocyanate complexes. The examined fracture plane indicated that charge pairs (which are essential for light emission) form when intermolecular interactions are disrupted during fracturing. On the basis of the nature of these charges, we successfully suppressed triboluminescence by inhibiting the formation of intermolecular interactions disrupted in the examined complexes. Furthermore, we induced its re&#8208;emergence by creating an alternative fracture plane through controlled manipulation of the molecular network. This demonstrative deactivation and reactivation of triboluminescence underscores the critical role of intermolecular disruption in generating charge pairs, a prerequisite for triboluminescence.

         <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability of Tetra&#8208;o&#8211;chloroazobenzene Derivatives by Transforming Push&#8208;Pull to Push&#8208;Push Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>

From push&#8208;pull to push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes: Six new tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes bearing push&#8208;pull systems displaying very short half&#8208;life for the Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&lt;10&#8197;ms) have been successfully synthesized via the azo&#8208;coupling method. Through one&#8208;step reduction of the nitro group, the push&#8208;pull tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes can be readily transformed into the push&#8208;push derivatives, with dramatically increased thermostability for the corresponding Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&gt;4&#8197;h). Furthermore, these functionalisable azobenzenes demonstrate excellent photostability under full&#8208;visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches provide interesting tools to reversibly control various biological functions with light. Thanks to its small size and easy introduction into the biomolecules, azobenzene derivatives have been widely employed in the field of photopharmacology. All visible&#8208;light switchable azobenzenes with controllable thermostability are highly demanded. Based on the reported tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes, we synthesized push&#8208;pull systems, by introducing dialkyl amine and nitro groups as strong electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the para&#8208;positions, and then transformed to push&#8208;push systems by a simple reduction step. The developed push&#8208;pull and push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzene derivatives displayed excellent photoswitching properties, as previously reported. The half&#8208;life of the Z&#8208;isomers can be tuned from milliseconds for the push&#8208;pull system to several hours for the push&#8208;push system. The n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transitions have better resolution in the push&#8208;push molecules, and excitation at different wavelengths can tune the E/Z ratio at the photostationary state. For one push&#8208;pull molecule, structure and absorption spectra obtained from theoretical calculations are compared with experimental data, along with data on the push&#8208;push counterpart.

         <title>Quantitative Characterization of RCA&#8208;Based DNA Hydrogels &#8211; Towards Rational Materials Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of template sequences and reaction conditions on the synthesis of DNA hydrogels via Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) was systematically investigated. The employed methodology is high&#8208;throughput capable and facilitates the development of sequence&#8208;property relationships by correlating reaction process parameters with synthesis efficiency and mechanical material properties.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking. This study varied template sequences and reagent concentrations, evaluating RCA synthesis efficiency and hydrogel mechanical properties through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and indentation measurements, respectively. Primer concentration and stabilizing additives showed minimal impact on RCA efficiency, while changes in polymerase and nucleotide concentrations had a stronger effect. Concentration of the circular template exerted the greatest influence on RCA productivity. An exponential correlation between hydrogel viscosity and DNA amplicon concentration was observed, with nucleobase sequence significantly affecting both amplification efficiency and material properties, particularly through secondary structures. This study suggests that combining high&#8208;throughput experimental methods with structural folding prediction offers a viable approach for systematically establishing structure&#8208;property relationships, aiding the rational design of DNA hydrogel material systems.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Azines Bearing a Guanidine Core from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Derived Selenoureas and Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study introduces a novel transformation between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived selenoureas and diazo compounds in the presence of triphenylphosphine. Products incorporating both an azine and a guanidine moiety are obtained, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;derived selenoureas comprise a fundamentally important class of NHC derivatives, with key applications in coordination chemistry and the determination of NHC electronic properties. Considering the broad reactivity of chalcogen&#8208;containing compounds, it is surprising to note that the use of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas as organic synthons remains essentially unexplored. The present contribution introduces a novel, straightforward transformation leading to azines bearing a guanidine moiety, through the reaction of a wide range of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas with commercially available diazo compounds, in the presence of triphenylphosphine. This transformation offers a new approach to such products, having biological, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis applications. The guanidine&#8208;bearing azines are obtained in excellent yields, with all manipulations taking place in air. A reaction mechanism is proposed, based on both experimental mechanistic findings and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A one&#8208;pot, multicomponent transesterification reaction between selenoureas, &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, alcohols, and triphenylphosphine was also developed, providing highly functionalized azines.

         <title>Efficient Adsorption and Elimination of Tm3+ for Enhanced Seed Germination Using Pillar[5]Arene Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the design and synthesis of a pillar[5] arene&#8208;based polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) for enhancing the adsorption and recovery of rare earth elements (REE). Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent adsorption capacity, thermal stability, and porous structure. It shows versatility in absorbing and recovering various RREs, with the potential for reuse in green agriculture.







Abstract
While rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for modern technology, their production methods raise concerns for agriculture. Researchers are now exploring ways to control and recycle REEs pollution, aiming to minimize agricultural impacts and potentially even develop methods to utilize these elements for improved crop yields. Regarding this issue, a new type of pillar[5]arene polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) has been designed and synthesized by click reaction to enhance the efficiency of adsorption and recovery of rare earth metals. This polymer incorporates the unique structure of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;pyridine. The results of various analyses revealed that Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent thermal stability, a high specific surface area, and well&#8208;distributed networks of micropores and mesoporous structures. The adsorption capacity of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for Tm3+, a representative REE, was evaluated using the Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal adsorption models with a maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of 127.71&#8197;mg/g. Furthermore, the versatility of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in adsorption and recovering various REEs was tested. In addition to its adsorption capabilities, the potential of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for rare earth recovery and reuse was assessed through experiments on the impact of Tm3+ and La3+ on seed germination. These experiments demonstrated the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in recovering and reusing REEs for green agriculture.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Ferrocene Conjugate for the Combined Photodynamic Therapy and Chemodynamic Therapy with Improved Antitumor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation ability has been designed and synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared conjugate can significantly improve the intracellular ROS level of tumor cells by combining PDT and CDT at low drug doses, thus realizing the efficient tumor cells killing with a synergistic strategy.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can destroy tumor cells by generating singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is limited by the hypoxia of the neoplastic tissue. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) can produce toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) to eradicate tumor cells by catalytic decomposition of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the therapeutic effect of which is highly dependent on the concentration of H2O2. Herein, we propose a BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with a balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation capacity, which can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency antitumor agent by combining PDT and CDT. The ferrocene moieties endow the as&#8208;prepared conjugates with the ability of chemodynamic killing of tumor cells. Moreover, combined PDT/CDT therapy with improved antitumor efficiency can be realized after exposure to light irradiation. Compared with the monotherapy by PDT or CDT, the BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugates can significantly increase the intracellular ROS levels of the tumor cells after light irradiation, thereby inducing the tumor cell apoptosis at low drug doses. In this way, a synergistic antitumor treatment is achieved by the combination of PDT and CDT.

         <title>Solvent Effect on Dative and Ionic Bond Strengths: A Unified Theory from Potential Analysis and Valence&#8208;Bond Computations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential energy surface (PES) analysis is conducted to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics, along the bond distances. The different responses of Me3NBH3 (blue&#8208;shifting) and LiCl (red&#8208;shifting) to solvation are subsequently examined with valence bond (VB) theory.







Abstract
Solvent molecules interact with a solute through various intermolecular forces. Here we employed a potential energy surface (PES) analysis to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics. The change of a bond is driven by the gradient (force) of the solvent&#8208;solute interaction energy with respect to the focused bond length. Positive force shortens the bond length and increases the bond force constant, leading to a blue&#8208;shift of the bond stretching vibrational frequency upon solvation. Conversely, negative force elongates the bond, resulting in a reduced bond force constant and red&#8208;shift of the stretching vibrational frequency. The different responses of Me3NBH3 and LiCl to solvation are studied with valence bond (VB) theory, as Me3NBH3 and LiCl are dominated by the neutral covalent VB structure and the ionic VB structure, respectively. The dipole moment of an ionic VB structure increases along the increasing bond distance, while the dipole moment of a neutral covalent VB structure increases with the decreasing bond distance. The roles of the dominating VB structures are further examined by the geometry optimizations and frequency calculations with the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method.

         <title>Unveiling the Twisted Aromatic Donor Effect on the Nonlinear Response of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type Malononitrile&#8208;Derived Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structure modification by incorporating twisted aromatic donors into malononitrile&#8208;derived D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A chromophores results in diminished charge separation and intramolecular charge transfer, as demonstrated by the reduced nonlinear response compared to their planar counterparts.







Abstract
This study presents the design, synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of a novel series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type malononitrile&#8208;derived chromophores, BTC&#8208;1&#8211;BTC&#8208;4. Combining various spectroscopic techniques, nonlinear Z&#8208;scan measurements, and quantum chemical calculations, we revealed the intricate relationship between nonlinear optical properties and the interplay of molecular structure, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and dipole moments (&#956;). Our experimental and computational findings corroborate that the polarization degree in the ground state, the charge separation in the excited state and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) collectively dictate the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds. Notably, BTC&#8208;1 exhibits an exceptional nonlinear absorption coefficient &#946; value (2&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;m&#8201;W&#8722;1), attributed to its optimized charge transfer efficiency and pronounced degree of charge separation. Our findings provide actionable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic Nonlinear optics (NLO) materials with potential applications in advanced photonic devices.

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Ordered Mesoporous Polymer as a Versatile, Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzothiadiazole&#8208;functionalized ordered mesoporous polymer (OMP) is synthesized by an evaporation induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) approach, which is used as a versatile heterogeneous photocatalyst for a wide variety of organic transformations (six reactions). This work suggests a new avenue to develop photoactive OMPs as next generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light active heterogeneous organophotocatalysts have recently gained considerable interest in organic synthetic community. Ordered mesoporous polymers (OMPs) are highly promising as heterogeneous alternative to traditional precious metal/organic dyes&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of a benzothiadiazole functionalized OMPs (BT&#8208;MPs) through a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; strategy. High ordered periodic porosity, large surface area, excellent stability and rational energy&#8208;band structures guarantee the high catalytic activity of BT&#8208;MPs. As a result, at least six conversions, e.&#8201;g., the [3+2] cycloaddition of phenols with olefins, the selective oxidation of sulfides, the C&#8208;3 thiocyanation of indole and the aminothiocyanation of &#946;&#8208;keto ester, could be promoted smoothly by BT&#8208;MPs. In addition, BT&#8208;MPs was readily recovered with well maintaining its photocatalytic activity and could be reused for at least eight times. This study highlights the potential of exploiting photoactive OMPs as recyclable, robust and metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalysts.

As a result, at least six conversions, e.&#8201;g., the [3+2] cycloaddition of phenols with olefins, the selective oxidation of sulfides, the C-3 thiocyanation of indole and the aminothiocyanation of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-keto ester, could be promoted smoothly by BT-MPs. In addition, BT-MPs was readily recovered with well maintaining its photocatalytic activity and could be reused for at least eight times. This study highlights the potential of exploiting photoactive OMPs as recyclable, robust and metal-free heterogeneous photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tweezer Dyads for H&#8208;Bond Assisted Cooperativity in Tandem Uncaging Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>

Tweezer dyads synthesized by click chemistry harness large two&#8208;photon absorption in the NIR region from quadrupolar antenna and enhancement of the uncaging efficiency via electron transfer sensitization leading to very high two&#8208;photon sensitivity.







Abstract
&#8220;Tandem&#8221; uncaging systems, in which a photolabile protecting group (PPG) is sensitized by an energy&#8208;harvesting antenna, may increase the photosensitivity of PPGs by several orders of magnitude for two&#8208;photon (2P) photorelease. Yet, they remain poorly accessible because of arduous multi&#8208;step synthesis. In this work, we design efficient tandem uncaging systems by (i) using a convenient assembly of the building blocks relying on click chemistry, (ii) introducing H&#8208;bonding induced proximity thus facilitating (iii) photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a cooperative mechanism. A strong two&#8208;photon absorber electron&#8208;donating quadrupolar antenna and various electron&#8208;accepting PPGs (mDEAC, MNI or MDNI) were clicked stepwise onto a &#8220;tweezer&#8208;shaped&#8221; pyrido&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate platform whose H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking abilities were exploited to keep the antenna and the PPGs in close proximity. The different electron&#8208;accepting ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo&#8208;uncaging ability due to their too high electron&#8208;accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (&#934;u=0.38) compared to mDEAC (&#934;u=0.014). This unique combination resulted in large 2P photo&#8208;sensitivity in the near&#8208;infrared window (240&#8197;GM at 710&#8197;nm).

Abstract
Complex oxides Eu2MeO6 (Me&#8211;Mo, W), Eu2W2O9 were obtained by a solid&#8208;phase reaction between binary oxides. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms of the reaction processes were established using a variety of physical&#8208;chemical methods. All compounds obtained in this work crystallize in the low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic system, forming complex framework structures, which determine a set of very valuable physical&#8208;chemical properties. Comparison of experimental Kubelka&#8208;Munk functions and DFT&#8208; calculated absorption spectra shows adequate agreement and reveals the origin of the fundamental absorption. In addition, the deficiency in DFT calculations in the part of mutual contribution of CTBs of Mo&#8722;O and W&#8722;O, from one side, and Eu&#8722;O contributions, from the other side, is reported. Calculations of absorption spectra are shown to be superior to band structure analysis in the determination of optical band gaps. Additionally, luminescent properties of Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9 compounds were investigated. These studies provide a better understanding of the electronic and optical properties of the compounds Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9, along with their potential applications in various areas.

Potent tetrapodal Se&#8208;based ChB receptors selectively extract ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium, employing both precipitation and LLE method.







Abstract
Efficient recognition and extraction of hazardous anionic pollutants from water medium is of great significance for environmental concerns, representing a challenging area of research in supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive demonstration of the ability of chalcogen bonding (ChB) to recognize and remove the ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium. The anion recognition ability is well elucidated through solution phase NMR and ITC studies, which clearly reveal the selective binding of ReO4&#8722; over other oxo&#8208;anions. Moreover, the selenoimidazolium scaffold effectively engages in Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O ChB interaction with ReO4&#8722; as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure and XPS analysis. More importantly, the binding of ReO4&#8722; with different prolongations of the &#963;&#8211;holes, along with Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Se chalcogen bonding interactions, lead to the formation of a 1D supramolecular assembly. Eventually, ChB receptor Se4Me&#8722;Br exhibits ~62&#8201;% ReO4&#8722; extraction efficiency through precipitation as the extraction method. Furthermore, in efforts to enhance efficiency, a hydrophobic ChB receptor Se4Do&#8208;PF6 has been prepared, achieving an efficiency of up to ~93&#8201;% at a very low concentration (~5&#8197;ppm) by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction.

         <title>N&#8208;Vacancy Enriched Porous BN Fibers for Enhanced Polysulfides Adsorption and Conversion in High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

This work presented herein centers on the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) BN fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects, achieved through a unique strategy of thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. After incorporating these fibers with highly interweaved bacterial cellulose (BC) followed by carbonization, the resulting Nv&#8208;BN@CBC exhibited higher specific capacity, superior rate capability, and more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one&#8208;dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N&#8208;vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as&#8208;prepared S/Nv&#8208;BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect&#8208;engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one-dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N-vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre-condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N-vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate-limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as-prepared S/Nv-BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect-engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 is an enzyme with a key role in various diseases. We developed a library of chiral smart molecules to explore, navigate and inhibit this enzyme, integrating specific structural elements from marine&#8208;derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) and synthetic fragment derivatives. These PE&#8208;based inhibitors exhibit time&#8208;dependent inhibition and varying potency based on stereochemistry and warhead positioning.







Abstract
Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 (15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1) is a key enzyme that possesses an important role in (neuro)inflammatory diseases. The pocket of the enzyme plays the role of a chiral catalyst, and therefore chirality could be an important component for the design of effective enzyme inhibitors. To advance our knowledge on this concept, we developed a library of the identified chiral 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibitors and applied cheminformatic tools. Our analysis highlighted specific structural elements, which we integrated them in small molecules, and employed them as &#8220;smart&#8221; tools to effectively navigate the chemical space of previously unexplored regions. To this purpose, we utilized the marine derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) among with a small library of synthetic fragment derivatives, including a certain degree of stereochemical diversity. Enzyme inhibition/kinetic and molecular modelling studies has been performed in order to characterize structurally novel PE&#8208;based inhibitors, which proved to present a different type of inhibition with low micromolar potency, according to their structural features. We demonstrate that different warheads work as anchor, and either guide specific stereochemistry, or causing a time&#8208;depended inhibition. Finally, we prove that the positioning of the chiral substituents or/and the favorable stereochemistry can be crucial, as it can lead from active to completely inactive compounds.

Acid&#8208;induced reduction of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO(g) on CoII&#8722;CoII centers in a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H) via a proposed nitrous acid [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;ONOH&#8722;CoII]4+ ([Cu(ONOH)Co]+4) intermediate species.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) serves as a pool of nitric oxide (NO) in biological systems under hypoxic conditions, and it is transformed to NO by nitrite reductase (NiR) enzyme in the presence of acid (H+ ions). However, NO synthases (NOSs) generate NO via L&#8208;arginine oxidation in normoxic conditions. Previously, acid&#8208;induced NO2&#8722; reduction chemistry was modeled on mono&#8208;metallic 3d&#8208;metals, generating metal&#8208;nitrosyls or NO(g) with H2O or H2O2 products. Herein, to understand the relative potency of a bimetallic system, we report the acid&#8208;induced reductive conversion of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO on CuII&#8722;CoII centers of a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII, 2) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H). The CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII generates [CuII(LN8H)CoII]4+ (1) upon reaction with one equiv. acid (HClO4, H+ ions source) with NO(g) via a presumed transient nitrousacid (ONOH) intermediate species. Likewise, this NO2&#8722; reduction was found to form H2O, which is believed to be from the decomposition of H2O2, an intermediate species. In addition, complex 2, in the presence of more than one equiv. H+ ions also showed the formation of NO(g) with H2O. Mechanistic investigations, using 15N&#8208;labeled&#8208;15NO2&#8722;, 18O&#8208;labeled&#8208;18O14N16O&#8722; and 2H&#8208;labeled&#8208;DClO4 (D+ source), revealed that the N&#8208;atom and O&#8208;atom in the 14/15NO and 14N18O gases are derived from NO2&#8722; ligand and H&#8208;atom in H2O derived from H+&#8208;source, respectively.

         <title>Cascade C&#8722;H Activation and Two C&#8722;C Bond Forming in Reaction of Azalutetacyclopentadiene with 2&#8208;Methylbenzonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadiene toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles provides a series of fused 7&#8211;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle products. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through three steps: the activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond, followed by the first intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form the first new C&#8722;C bond, and then the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of uncoordinated carbanion toward C=N triple bond. Two new C&#8722;C bonds are formed in the highly selective three&#8208;step cascade transformation.







Abstract
Azametallacyclopentadienes are an important class of metallacycles as the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted or catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reaction of nitriles and alkynes. Rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes have shown various reactivity toward nitriles, depending on the substituents of nitriles. The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles has been investigated in this work, which selectively affords the fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycles as products. Computational studies reveal that the reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles selectively initiates with the remote activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond by the Lu&#8722;N bond, followed by the intramolecular nucleophilic attack from the deprotonated benzylic carbon to form a C&#8722;C bond. Subsequently, the high ring strain promoted the generation of the uncoordinated carbanion dissociated from the lutetium center, which then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic attack toward C=N triple bond to give the final product containing fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle. This work not only achieves highly selective three&#8208;step cascade reaction to form a unique class of rare&#8208;earth metallacycle, but also provides a new idea for the transformation of unsaturated substrates with C&#8722;H bonds that can be activated.

The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2-methylbenzonitriles has been investigated in this work, which selectively affords the fused 7-5-6-membered azalutetacycles as products. Computational studies reveal that the reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2-methylbenzonitriles selectively initiates with the remote activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond by the Lu&#8722;N bond, followed by the intramolecular nucleophilic attack from the deprotonated benzylic carbon to form a C&#8722;C bond. Subsequently, the high ring strain promoted the generation of the uncoordinated carbanion dissociated from the lutetium center, which then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic attack toward C=N triple bond to give the final product containing fused 7-5-6-membered azalutetacycle. This work not only achieves highly selective three-step cascade reaction to form a unique class of rare-earth metallacycle, but also provides a new idea for the transformation of unsaturated substrates with C&#8722;H bonds that can be activated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Well&#8208;Defined Magnesium Complex of C706&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined soluble magnesium complex of the C706&#8722; ion has been prepared and characterised, and the various global and local changes to structure, charges and orbitals as a result of reduction and countercation coordination are discussed.







Abstract
Controlling and understanding charge state and metal coordination in carbon nanomaterials is crucial to harnessing their unique properties. Here we describe the synthesis of the well&#8208;defined fulleride complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}6C70], 2, (Mesnacnac)=HC(MeCNMes)2, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, from the reaction of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate magnesium(I) complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}2] with C70 in aromatic solvents. The molecular structure of complex 2 was determined, providing the first high&#8208;quality structural study of a complex with the C706&#8722; ion. In combination with solution state NMR spectroscopic and DFT computational studies, the changes in geometry and charge distribution in the various atom and bond types of the fulleride unit were investigated. Additionally, the influence of the (Mesnacnac)Mg+ cations on the global and local fulleride coordination environment was examined.

         <title>Aliphatic Ketone Claisen Rearrangement: Troubleshooting the Transetherification Step by Identifying a Stable Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple catalyst for the ketone Claisen rearrangement. By optimizing the benzoic acid catalysts for the Claisen rearrangement sequence that starts with allylic alcohols and enol ethers or ketone acetals, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid catalyst emerged as a catalyst that retains its activity in the process. This catalyst enables ketone Claisen reactions with even acid&#8208; and heat&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butoxycarbonylamines (BocNH), or tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ethers.







Abstract
After optimization for retention of catalytic activity, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid emerged as the optimal catalyst for the aliphatic ketone Claisen rearrangement. The optimal catalyst enables a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free, catalytic protocol from allylic alcohols to &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The optimized process tolerates a range of substrates, including substituents with acid&#8208;labile protecting groups. Reaction monitoring and DFT studies of the aliphatic ketone Claisen process agree that the ultimate rearrangement step typically has the highest activation barrier.

         <title>De&#8208; and Rearomatisation of Pyridine in Silylene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dearomatisation process of pyridine is facilitated by the metal&#8208;free reactions of pyridylamino&#8208;functionalized silylene with benzophenone or acetophenone. The former resulting product can undergo further rearomatisation of pyridine upon heating. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.







Abstract
Traditional methods relying on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation for activating pyridine bonds in de&#8208; and rearomatisation are being challenged by the abundant metal&#8208;free element species as alternatives. Here, we investigated the de/re&#8208;aromatisation of pyridine facilitated by pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene reactions with ketones and ketene. The reactivity outcome is highly dependent on the substituents on the ketones. By carefully tuning the steric demand of the ketone, each intermediate of the reaction sequence could be isolated. At room temperature, benzophenone and acetophenone substrates led to dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety, with the case of acetophenone showing an intermediate silaoxirane preceding dearomatisation. However, when subjected to acetone or diphenylketene, only silaoxiranes were formed without dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety. Notably, only benzophenone&#8208;derived dearomatised species demonstrated rearomatisation upon heating. Furthermore, the reduced steric bulk of the ketene facilitated further ring expansion with another equivalent of the substrate, forming sila&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolanes. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Brightness Heterogeneity in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 53, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through advanced PIE&#8208;FCS and blinking studies, we investigated the FCS behaviors of nanoparticles with single&#8208;photon purity. Our findings reveal that several FCS characteristics, such as reduced g2(0) amplitude and extended diffusion time at high pump intensity, stem from brightness heterogeneity, which is, light&#8208;induced ON/OFF blinking of individual nanoparticles.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs), including perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with single photon purity, present challenges in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies due to their distinct photoluminescence (PL) behaviors. In particular, the zero&#8208;time correlation amplitude [g2(0)] and the associated diffusion timescale (&#964;D) of their FCS curves show substantial dependency on pump intensity (IP). Optical saturation inadequately explains the origin of this FCS phenomenon in NPs, thus setting them apart from conventional dye molecules, which do not manifest such behavior. This observation is apparently attributed to either photo&#8208;brightening or optical trapping, both lead to increased NP occupancy (N) in the excitation volume, consequently reducing the g2(0) amplitude [since g2(0) &#945; 1/N] at high IP. However, an advanced FCS study utilizing alternating laser excitation at two different intensities dismisses such possibilities. Further investigation into single&#8208;particle blinking behaviors as a function of IP reveals that the intensity dependence of g2(0) primarily arises from the brightness heterogeneity prevalent in almost all types of NPs. This report delves into the complexities of the photophysical properties of NPs and their adverse impacts on FCS studies.

The simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs, associating axial&#8208;chiral thiourea organocatalysts and phosphazene bases, allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity (kD/kL=18.1) for the AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Asymmetric kinetic resolution polymerization (AKRP) provides an ideal way to obtain highly isotactic polylactide (PLA) with superior thermal&#8208;mechanical properties from racemic lactide (rac&#8208;LA). However, the development of a new catalytic system with concurrent high activity and selectivity at ambient temperature remains a great callenge. Here, a series of simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs containing axial&#8208;chiral thioureas and commercially available phosphazene bases were designed. These chiral binary organocatalytic pairs allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity for AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C. The highest kinetic resolution coefficient (krel) of 8.5 at 47&#8201;% conversion was obtained, and D&#8208;LA was preferentially polymerized via kinetic resolution with a maximum selectivity factor (kD/kL) of 18.1, indicating that an enantiomorphic site control mechanism (ESC) was involved.

A novel, machine learning&#8208;assisted, high&#8208;throughput method for synthesizing metal nanoclusters is unveiled. The developed approach not only fast&#8208;tracks the discovery of such nanoclusters but also enhances synthesis efficiency. A myriad of different nanoclusters were successfully created, including Au41Cu66, Au40Cu34, Au18Cu32, Au18, Au6Cu6, and Cu&#8722;NC nanoclusters. This study underscores the role of high&#8208;throughput screening as a fundamental tool in pushing the boundaries of nanocluster research.

         <dc:description>
Complex oxides Eu2MeO6 (Me=Mo, W) and Eu2W2O9 were obtained in a solid&#8208;phase reaction between binary oxides. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms of the reaction processes were established by using a variety of physicochemical methods. Calculations of absorption spectra are shown to be superior to band structure analysis in the determination of optical band gaps. In this work, the experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical models. More information can be found in the Research Article by Yu.&#8197;G. Denisenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402084).

Our characterized charged fracture planes, a crucial phenomenon for triboluminescence, are shown by using molecular networking and electrostatic potential. The lightning between the planes symbolizes the energy released from disrupted electrostatic interactions during fracturing, harnessed for triboluminescence. The background photographs depict single crystals (left) and their emission during fracturing (triboluminescence, right), as investigated in our study. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Hoshino and Y. Ohgo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401715).

         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for the dearomatisation of pyridine through metal&#8208;free reactions of pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene with benzophenone or acetophenone that challenges traditional metal&#8211;ligand approaches. Notably, the product formed with benzophenone can undergo rearomatisation upon heating. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups play critical roles in the dearomatisation process within pyridylaminosilylene reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by X. Sun, P. Roesky and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402456). Artwork by Chenxin Li and Da Jin.

         <title>Highly Efficient Detection of Pd2+ in Aqueous Medium by an Elusive Mn(II) Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a Mn(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer (CP); and its structure, phase consistency and thermal stability have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA) respectively. This is the first example of paramgnetic Mn(II)&#8208;based CP that acts as pH&#8208;dependent emitting material [lem= 525 nm (pH = 2.0&#8208;4.0) and 450 nm (pH = 5.0&#8208;12.0)]. Its emission is quenched by Pd2+ in aqueous medium in presence of other thirteen cations with reasonably low pH&#8208;dependent limits of detection (LODs) [21.178 ppb (pH= 3), 15.005 ppb (pH = 7.0) and 59.940 ppb (pH = 10.0)] as described by well&#8208;established mechanism.

This is the first example of paramgnetic Mn(II)-based CP that acts as pH-dependent emitting material [lem= 525 nm (pH = 2.0-4.0) and 450 nm (pH = 5.0-12.0)]. Its emission is quenched by Pd2+ in aqueous medium in presence of other thirteen cations with reasonably low pH-dependent limits of detection (LODs) [21.178 ppb (pH= 3), 15.005 ppb (pH = 7.0) and 59.940 ppb (pH = 10.0)] as described by well-established mechanism. Therefore, urgency of such stable sensor remains high in regard to the environmental pollution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Stability and Kinetics of Dioxazaborocanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the equilibrium reaction of boronic acid (BA), diethanolamines (DEA), and 1,3,6,2&#8208;dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) in aqueous solutions, both theoretically and experimentally. Our findings show that the association constant can be adjusted by substituting BA and DEA derivatives, ranging from 100 to 103 M&#8722;1, exhibiting a bell&#8208;shaped pH dependency. The highest stability was achieved when the pKa values of DEA and BA were closely matched. This approach enabled the preparation of a highly stable DOAB under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis kinetics of DOABs were controllable over a range of five orders of magnitude based on the substituent&#8217;s steric effect. In the slowest case, this resulted in quasi&#8208;static stability with only 1% cleavage in the first hour, followed by a week&#8208;long cleavage period to reach equilibrium. These insights could establish a unique chemistry platform for designing scheduled cleavability on a day&#8208;to&#8208;week timescale, relevant to protein engineering, immunotherapy, and other smart drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonium SF5&#8722; Salts Derived from Sulfur Hexafluoride as Deoxyfluorination Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur hexafluoride valorization with phosphines affords crystalline phosphonium SF5&#8722; salts that are used as deoxyfluorination reagents.







Abstract
Sulfur based deoxyfluorination reagents are usually derived from the corrosive gas SF4. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of an easily accessible phosphonium salt [(tmg)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (1) which was obtained from the reaction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine. The performance of this crystalline SF5&#8722; salt as a reagent in deoxyfluorination reactions was investigated together with a second SF5&#8722; salt [(R1)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (2) containing bulky substituents (R1=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino). Both reagents proved to be effective for the deoxyfluorination of various functional groups including alcohols, anhydrides, and amides.

         <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance Allows to Correlate Molecular Properties With Diffusion Coefficients of Linear Chain Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new model to describe and fit the behavior of diffusion coefficients (D) as a function of molecular structure and thermodynamic parameters in binary solutions of linear chain organic molecules. The model is validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a series of n&#8208;alcohols, revealing a strong dependence of D on molecular shape and solute&#8208;solvent interactions.

&#8208;alcohols through a novel surface plasmon resonance method and molecular dynamics simulations. This allows to propose a kind of combined analysis to explain the dependence of

 on various thermodynamic and structural parameters. The results suggest that for small linear systems in the range from 0 to 200&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and under the assumption that the diffusive activation energy is a linear function of mass,

 is strictly dependent on the molecular shape and on the relative strength of the solute&#8208;solvent intermolecular forces represented by a parameter named R.

         <title>Tracking Microenvironmental Response on Self&#8208;Assembled Phthalocyanine Systems &#8211; Adaptive and Non&#8208;Adaptive Antibacterial Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, we investigate how self&#8208;assembled photosensitizers respond to changes in molecular crowding and presence of different bacteria. We observed that certain systems exhibit adaptive behavior and alter their photoinduced activity, while others do not, highlighting the impact of confined environments and intermolecular interactions on the relaxation pathways of excited states in photoactive molecules.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.

         <title>Improved Electrochemical Peptide Synthesis Enabled by Electron&#8208;Rich Triaryl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) phosphine enable the electrochemical synthesis of peptides which are difficult with the previously reported method using triphenyl phosphine. In addition, this phosphine has a potential to be a recyclable coupling reagent. This study also presents that substituents on phosphines influence the reactivity of phosphine (radical) cation and have an important role in avoiding side reactions.







Abstract
While remarkable progress has been made in the development of peptide medicines, many problems related to peptide synthesis remain unresolved. Previously, we reported electrochemical peptide synthesis using a phosphine as a potentially recyclable coupling reagent. However, there was room for improvement from the point of view of reaction efficiency, especially in the carboxylic acid activation step and the peptide bond formation step. To overcome these challenges, we searched for the optimal phosphine. Among phosphines with various electronic properties, we found that electron&#8208;rich triaryl phosphines improved the reaction efficiency. Consequently, we successfully performed electrochemical peptide synthesis on sterically hindered and valuable amino acids. We also synthesized oligopeptides that were challenging with our previous method. Finally, we examined the effect of substituents on the phosphine cations, and gained some insights into reactivity, which will aid researchers designing reactions involving phosphine cations.

         <title>Cobalt Nanoparticles Catalyzed N&#8208;Heterocycles Synthesis via Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst derived from MOFs/SiO2 composite was prepared using a one&#8208;step assembly process involving pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activity in the synthesis of quinoline and pyridine derivatives through acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols.







Abstract
The acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction is a sustainable and atom&#8208;economical methodology in organic synthesis, resulting in the byproducts of only hydrogen or water. Herein, a robust Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst (derived from ZIF@SiO2 composite) has been synthesized through a one&#8208;step assembly process via pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst has been employed for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols, enabling efficient conversion of various substrates into desired quinoline or pyridine derivatives with a yield of up to 94&#8201;%.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Functionalization for the Preparation of Cobaltocene&#8208;Modified Redox&#8208;Responsive Porous Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convenient modification of microparticles with cobaltocenium moieties is described by taking advantage of a hydroamination reaction with a metal&#8208;containing acetylene derivative. The high accuracy of this technique opens the way to tailored stimuli&#8208;responsive spheres showing reversible redox&#8208;addressability over high cycling numbers. The herein&#8208;presented metallopolymer&#8208;based particles can also be converted to porous ceramics.







Abstract
Porous organic cobaltocenium&#8208;containing particles are scarce in literature but highly interesting for their electrochemical properties and reusability in, for example, catalysis or magnetic systems. In this work, we present a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy to introduce tailorable amounts of cobaltocenium on a porous substrate, adjusting the electrochemical switching capability. For this purpose, 3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;amine (APTES) and ethynyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate is used as functionalization agents for in&#8208;situ catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination, followed by silane condensation at the particles&#8217; surface. Functionalized particles are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing excellent control over the degree of functionalization, i.&#8201;e., the added cobaltocenium reagents. The electrochemical stability and good addressability while preserving the porous structure are shown. By utilizing higher amounts of APTES, the overall cobaltocenium amount can be reduced in favor of additional amine groups, strongly affecting the electrochemical behavior, making this functionalization strategy a good platform for metallopolymer immobilization and tailored functionalization. Additionally, thermal treatment of the synthesized metallopolymer microparticles paves the way to magnetic properties with tailorable microporous architectures for end&#8208;of&#8208;life and upcycling aspects.

         <title>Mapping Electrophile Chemoselectivity in DalPhos/Nickel N&#8208;Arylation Catalysis: The Unusual Influence of Remote Sterics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose herein our evaluation of competitive (hetero)aryl&#8208;X (X: Br &gt; Cl &gt; OTf) reactivity preferences in bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling catalysis, using furfurylamine as a prototypical nucleophile, and employing DalPhos and DPPF as representative ancillary ligands with established efficacy. Beyond this general (pseudo)halide ranking, other intriguing structure&#8208;reactivity trends were noted experimentally, including the unexpected observation that bulky alkyl (e.g., R = tBu) substitution in para&#8208;R&#8208;aryl&#8208;X electrophiles strongly discourages (pseudo)halide reactivity relative to smaller substituents (e.g., nBu, Et, Me), despite being both remote from, and having a similar electronic influence on, the reacting C&#8208;X bond; such effects on nickel oxidative addition have not been documented previously and were not observed in our comparator reactions presented herein involving palladium. Density functional theory modeling of such PhPAd&#8208;DalPhos/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings revealed the origins of competitive turnover of C&#8208;Br over C&#8208;Cl, and possible ways in which bulky para&#8208;alkyl substitution might discourage net electrophile uptake/turnover, leading to inversion of halide selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinguishing Organomagnesium Species in the Grignard Addition to Ketones with X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of Grignard reagents to ketones is a well&#8208;established textbook reaction. However, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism has only recently begun to emerge. X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, because of its high selectivity and sensitivity, is the ideal tool for distinguishing between an ensemble of competing pathways.&#160;With this aim in mind, we investigated the concerted mechanism of the addition of methylmagnesium chloride (CH$_3$MgCl) to acetone in tetrahydrofuran by simulating the X&#8208;ray spectra of different molecules in solution. We used electronic structure methods to calculate the X&#8208;ray absorption spectra at the Mg K&#8208; and L$_1$&#8208;edges and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra at the Mg K&#8208;edge for different organomagnesium species, which coexist in solution due to the Schlenk equilibrium.&#160;The simulated spectra show that individual species can be distinguished throughout the different stages of the reaction.Each species has a distinct spectral feature which can be used as a fingerprint in solution. The absorption and photoelectron spectra consistently show a blue shift as the reaction progressed from reagents to products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rare Example of a Gallium&#8208;based Lewis Superacid: Synthesis and Reactivity of Ga(OTeF5)3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Lewis superacid Ga(OTeF5)3 has been synthesized and characterized, revealing a monomeric structure in solution and a dimeric structure in the solid state. Isolated adducts of Ga(OTeF5)3 with strong and weak Lewis bases have been characterized spectroscopically as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The Lewis acidity of this new species has been evaluated by means of different experimental and theoretical methods, which has allowed to classify it as one of only a few examples of a gallium&#8208;based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity of Ga(OTeF5)3 was used to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5, leading to the protonation of diethyl ether. Furthermore, Ga(OTeF5)3 was utilized to access the strong oxidizing system Ga(OTeF5)3/Xe(OTeF5)2 in SO2ClF, which was successfully employed in the synthesis of the dimethyl chloronium salt [Cl(CH3)2][Ga(OTeF5)4], a strong electrophilic methylation reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Axial Coordination Engineering on Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C Materials for Oxygen Reduction: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axial coordination engineering has emerged as an effective strategy to regulate the catalytic performance of metal&#8210;N&#8210;C materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the ORR mechanism and activity changes of their active centers modified by axial ligands are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN4&#8210;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN4 center. Specially, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant&#8208;potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH = 1, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 possesses an impressive theoretical half&#8208;wave potential of ~1.01 V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C catalysts (~0.88 V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN4&#8210;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>An imine&#8208;functionalized silicone&#8208;based epoxy coating with stable adhesion and controllable degradation for enhanced marine antifouling and anticorrosion properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofouling and corrosion of submerged equipment caused by marine organisms severely restrict the rapid development of the marine industry. Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings typically serve a sole purpose and exhibit limited degradability upon failure, rendering them inadequate for current demands. Herein, a novel imine&#8208;functionalized command&#8208;degradable bio&#8208;based epoxy coating (SAHPEP&#8208;DDM) with enhanced integrated antifouling and anticorrosion performances was synthesized utilizing 1,3&#8208;bis (3&#8208;aminopropyl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane and syringaldehyde. Compared with commercial epoxy resins (E51&#8208;DDM) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), the SAHPEP&#8208;DDM coating exhibits superior antifouling and anticorrosion properties due to the existence of &#8208;C=N&#8208; and Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si chain segments in the cross&#8208;linking network. The coating&#160;shows promising resistance against bacteria, algae and proteins, as well as excellent corrosion resistance in artificial seawater. The coating also exhibits excellent chemical resistance in organic solvents as well as neutral and alkaline environments. Moreover, its controlled degradation after&#160;failure can be achieved in acid aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, facilitated by the presence of &#8208;C=N&#8208;. This work presents a novel degradable coating successfully coupled the dual functions of antifouling and anticorrosion coatings, avoiding the employment of intermediate coat, indicating vast potential for application in&#160;marine engineering fields.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient and practical method was developed for the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol ligands. The disclosed synthesis involves the Ullmann homocoupling of a keto bromo&#8208;pyridine under NiCl2/Zn/PPh3 conditions, followed by the stereoselective double hydrogen transfer to the obtained 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;diketone using RuII Noyori&#8211;Ikariya catalysts. This approach allowed the successful synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol, i.e (S,S)&#8208;Bolm's ligand, with a quantitative yield and an excellent stereoselectivity (ee&gt;99.5&#8201;%, de&gt;99.5&#8201;%), with an overall yield of 69&#8201;% from easily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Complex Biophysical and Computational Analyses of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: The Porphyrin Stacks Back</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), as non&#8208;canonical DNA structures, attract a great deal of research interest in the molecular biology as well as in the material science fields. The use of small molecules as ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes has emerged as a tool to regulate gene expression and telomeres maintenance. Meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP4) was shown as one of the first ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes and it is still widely used. We report an investigation comprising molecular docking and dynamics, synthesis and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations on simple cationic porphyrins and their interaction with different DNA sequences. The study allowed to synthesize a few compounds that have shown to interact with DNA; the detailed characterization has shown that the presence of amide groups at the periphery improves selectivity for parallel G4s binding over other structures. Taking into account the ease of synthesis, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin bromide could be considered a better alternative to TMPyP4 in studies involving G4 binding.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrosynthesis of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles from N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole is a widely encountered motif in the areas of pharmaceuticals, materials, and agrochemicals. This work has established a mild, mediated electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones. Using DABCO as the optimal redox mediator has enabled a mild oxidative cyclisation, without recourse to stoichiometric oxidants. In contrast to previous methods, this indirect electrochemical oxidation has enabled a broad range of substrates to be accessed, with yields of up to 83%, and on gram scale. The simplicity of the method has been further demonstrated by the development of a one&#8208;pot procedure, directly transforming readily available aldehydes and hydrazides into valuable heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Catalyzed Conjugate Additions to &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates &#8211; Steric Bulk Increases the Reaction Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organocatalytic conjugate addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates provides direct access to &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes and, thereby, common structural motifs of many bioactive compounds. However, the deactivation of amine&#8208;based catalysts by alkylation with the highly electrophilic nitroacrylates hampers this reaction.

Kinetic studies revealed that increased steric bulk on the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate enhances the reaction rate by hindering catalyst alkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Improvement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction with conjugated organic polymers by rational modulation of donor, acceptor and bonding method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metal&#8208;free catalysts to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals is very challenging. Here, we synthesized a conjugated organic polymer (TpTf&#8208;1) featuring 2,4,6&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Triazine as the acceptor unit, triphenylamine as the donor unit, and vinylidene bond as the linkage. The local structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) forms an intramolecular electric field that can promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and charges, meanwhile, the vinylidene bond can further change the charge distribution to promote exciton dissociation. Without the use of photosensitizers, the TpTf&#8208;1 exhibits outstanding selectivity of CO of up to 91.96%, with a production rate of 45.2 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at visible light, which is 3.4&#8208;fold than TaTf&#8208;1 with the same D&#8208;A structure but linking in imine bond and is 2.8&#8208;fold than TpTf&#8208;2 linking in vinylidene bond but with a different donor unit. Moreover, TpTf&#8208;1 has a CO production rate of up to 117.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under full wavelength light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Conduction via Water and Ammonia Coordinated Metal Cationic Species in MOF and MHOF Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metalo hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) are designed as promising solid&#8208;state proton conductors by incorporating various protonic species intrinsically or extrinsically, design and development of such materials by employing the concept of proton conduction through coordinated polar protic solvent is largely unexplored. Herein, we have constructed two proton&#8208;conducting materials having different solvent coordinated metal cationic species: In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, ({[In(H2O)6][In3(Pzdc)6]&#183;15H2O}n; H2Pzdc: pyrazine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid) with coordinated water molecules from hexaaquaindium cationic species, and MHOF&#8208;4, ([{Co(NH3)6}2(2,6&#8208;NDS)2(H2O)2]n; 2,6&#8208;H2NDS: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid) with coordinated ammonia from hexaammoniacobalt cationic species. Interestingly, higher proton conductivity was achieved for In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF (1.5 &#215; 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1) than MHOF&#8208;4 (6.3 &#215; 10&#8208;6 S cm&#8208;1) under the extreme conditions (80 &#186;C and 95% RH), which could be attributed to enhanced acidity of coordinated water molecules having much lower pKa value than that of coordinated ammonia. Greater charge polarization on hydrogen atoms of In3+&#8208;coordinated water molecules than that of Co2+&#8208;coordinated ammonia led to the high conductivity of In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, as evident by quantum chemical studies. Such a comparative study on metal&#8208;coordinated protic polar solvents in achieving proton conduction in crystalline solids is yet to be made.</dc:description>

         <title>Neptunyl Pyrrophen Complexes: Exploring Schiff Base Chemistry with Multidentate Acyclic Ligands and Transuranics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first two neptunyl&#8208;pyrrophen compounds. Formerly synthesized with uranyl, these unique hexadentate ligands readily coordinate equatorially with neptunyl ions. The crystal structure is determined, and diffuse reflectance and FTIR spectra are measured. Scrutiny is placed on the NpO2L1 compound which is determined to exist as a mixed valence species of Np(V/VI).







Abstract
We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state,. As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5&#8201;f electron participation and coordination.

         <title>Recent Toolboxes for Chemoselective Dual Modifications of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity to synthesize complex protein conjugates functionalized with two or more distinct moieties has revolutionized the field of chemical biology. This review summarizes contemporary chemical biology tools for protein dual chemical modifications, along with the discussion of their respective advantages, limitations, and potential future directions within this rapidly evolving area.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemical modifications of proteins have emerged as a potent technology in chemical biology, materials science, and medicine, facilitating precise manipulation of proteins with tailored functionalities for basic biology research and developing innovative therapeutics. Compared to traditional recombinant expression methods, one of the prominent advantages of chemical protein modification lies in its capacity to decorate proteins with a wide range of functional moieties, including non&#8208;genetically encoded ones, enabling the generation of novel protein conjugates with enhanced or previously unexplored properties. Among these, approaches for dual or multiple modifications of proteins are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modification of proteins is inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for dual functionalization of proteins. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are accomplished.







Abstract
Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.

         <title>Neutral and Anion Species of Quinoidal Thienothiophene Diketopyrrolopyrroles Display a Common Aggregation Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrol quinoidal oligomers aggregate in a very similar way in the neutral state and in the dimer dianion states due to an uniform distribution of the electron charge excess between the two molecules in the dimer dianion.







Abstract
A comprehensive investigation of two new molecular triads incorporating the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit into a quinoidized thienothiophene skeleton, which is further end&#8208;capped with dicyanomethylene (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;CN) or phenoxyl groups (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;PhO), has been carried out. A combination of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy supported by theoretical calculations has been used. The main result is the formation of similar H&#8208;aggregates in the dimerization process of the neutral molecules and of the charged anionic species. The experimental absorption spectra of the aggregated species are accurately reproduced by quantum chemical calculations using the Spano's model, including excitonic coupling for the dimeric forms and full vibronic resolution of the absorption bands. The strong excitonic coupling taking place is key to understand the electronic structure of the dimeric species and has been instrumental to disentangle the type of H&#8208;aggregation. This study is of relevance to get a better understanding of the molecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores and is useful as a guideline for the refinement of the engineering of molecular materials for which supramolecular design is required.

         <title>Tuning The Intracellular Distribution of [3+2+1] Iridium(III) Complexes In Bacterial And Mammalian Cells By iClick Reaction With Biomolecular Carriers Functionalized With Alkynone Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The colour and intracellular distribution of iridium(III) complexes is tuned by iClick conjugation of different biomolecular carriers&#8221;. The iClick (inorganic click) reaction enables a modular modification of iridium(III) complexes with ancillary triazolato ligands carrying biological targeting groups like biotin and cholic acid. The stability and non&#8208;toxicity of these compounds facilitates their use as biological imaging probes in bacterial and human cancer cells. Their intracellular localization can be tuned by proper peripheral functionalization of the complexes.







Abstract
Three iridium(III) triazolato complexes of the general formula [Ir(triazolatoR,R&#8217;)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6 with ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine and terpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine were efficiently prepared by iClick reaction of [Ir(N3)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6, with alkynes and alkynones, which allowed facile introduction of biological carriers such as biotin and cholic acid. In contrast to the precursor azido complex, which decomposed upon photoexcitation on a very short time scale, the triazolato complexes were stable in solution for up to 48&#8197;h. They emit in the spectral region around 540&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 15&#8211;35&#8201;% in aerated acetonitrile solution and exhibit low cytotoxicity with IC50 values &gt;50&#8197;&#956;M for most complexes in L929 and HeLa cells, demonstrating their high suitability as luminescent probes. Cell uptake studies with confocal luminescence microscopy in prokaryotic Gram&#8208;positive S. aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E. coli bacteria as well as eukaryotic mammalian L929 and HeLa cells showed significant uptake in particular of the cholic acid conjugates iridium(III) moiety and distinct intracellular distribution modulated by the nature of the peripheral functional groups that can easily be modified by the iClick reaction.

         <title>Skeletal Editing by Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Nitrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodonitrene (ArI=NR) is a highly reactive species that is commonly employed in a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction and skeletal editing for generating N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene intermediates has recently emerged as a powerful strategy in modern synthesis. In this review, we address the rapidly expanding field of nitrene insertion, which includes skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, the use of hypervalent iodine compounds to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and our present understanding of the process.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen&#8208;atom into hydrocarbons to generate N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.

         <title>Suppressing Protodeboronation in Cu&#8208;Mediated 19F/18F&#8208;Fluorination of Arylboronic Acids: A Mechanistically Guided Approach Towards Optimized PET Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was rationally optimized to minimize deleterious protodeboronation side&#8208;product in Cu&#8208;mediated 19F&#8208; and 18F&#8208;fluorination of arylboronic acids. Fluoride anion is activated through a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) effect under ligandless conditions featuring a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2. This mild protocol occurs at lower temperature and demonstrates improved generality with good yields and radiochemical conversions and minimal protodeboronation.







Abstract
Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for in&#8197;vivo imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid 18F/19F&#8208;fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu&#8208;mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure, with t&#8208;BuOH as solvent, to activate fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2 was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30&#8197;minutes at a temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39&#8201;% to 84&#8201;% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in 18F&#8208;radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17 and 54&#8201;% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.

&lt;p&gt;A method was rationally optimized to minimize deleterious protodeboronation side-product in Cu-mediated &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F- and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorination of arylboronic acids. Fluoride anion is activated through a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) effect under ligandless conditions featuring a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This mild protocol occurs at lower temperature and demonstrates improved generality with good yields and radiochemical conversions and minimal protodeboronation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu-mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F/&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu-mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure, with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BuOH as solvent, to activate fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30&#8197;minutes at a temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39&#8201;% to 84&#8201;% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17 and 54&#8201;% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P, N co&#8208;doped carbon has been used as cathode materials in Na&#8208;O2 batteries. The high battery performance is ascribed to the high adsorption energy toward NaO2 of this advanced cathode materials. The high adsorption energy of NaO2 can prevent NaO2 from decomposing into hard&#8208;to&#8208;decompose Na2O2 during discharging and thus increase the battery efficiency during the cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36&#8197;V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption (&#8722;2.85&#8197;eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8722;1.80&#8197;eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.

         <title>Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported in comparison with the empty C360 and C362&#8722; cages. Among all [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6 6] C&#8722;C bonds the [5&#8208;5] bond is the most reactive bond in both the empty C36 and metallofullerene M@C36.







Abstract
Understanding the exohedral reactivity of metallofullerenes is crucial for its application in various fields. By systematically controlling the trapped species inside the fullerene its reactivity can be tamed. In this work we report the preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral reactivity in comparison with the neutral and the dianionic cage. The Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and all non&#8208;equivalent [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6&#8208;6] C&#8722;C bonds on the fullerene cage was considered for the analysis, by using density functional theory at the S12g/TZ2P level including COSMO solvation model to elucidate the complete mechanistic pathways. Our results indicate that the preferential position of the metal ion is at the position close to the upper hexagon, and that the general trend in the reactivity of bonds follows the order [5&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;6]. Moreover, the encapsulation of metal atoms further enhances the reactivity of these bonds, by lowering the LUMOs of the cage, hence maximizing the orbital interactions.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Synthesis Planning (CASP) and Machine Learning: Optimizing Chemical Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the topic of the Computer Aided Synthesis Project (CASP) and gives a detailed overview of the methods of machine learning to predict chemical reaction conditions, including the problem of data and descriptor selection, the indicators for the evaluation of results and the current research progress of various algorithms. The future research trends and possible challenges in chemical condition prediction are prospected.







Abstract
Computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP) has garnered increasing attention in light of recent advancements in machine learning models. While the focus is on reverse synthesis or forward outcome prediction, optimizing reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. For datasets with multiple variables, the choice of descriptors and models is pivotal. This selection dictates the effective extraction of conditional features and the achievement of higher prediction accuracy. This review delineates the origins of data in conditional optimization, the criteria for descriptor selection, the response models, and the metrics for outcome evaluation, aiming to acquaint readers with the latest research trends and facilitate more informed research in this domain.

         <title>Advancing Optoglycomics: Two Orthogonal Azobenzene Glycoside Antennas in One Glycocluster&#8211;Synthesis, Switching Cycles, Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool for the glycosciences: A heterobivalent glycocluster combines two photoswitchable azobenzene glycoside antennas with different photochromic properties. Hence, wavelength&#8208;selective E/Z isomerization of the glycoantennas is enabled and a switching cycle comprising three major isomers (EE, EZ, ZZ). Kinetic analysis explains the relaxation mechanism and MD simulations illustrate the relationship between isomeric state and distance between the sugar ligands.







Abstract
Carbohydrate recognition is essential for numerous biological processes and is governed by various factors within the supramolecular environment of the cell. Photoswitchable glycoconjugates have proven as valuable tools for the investigation and modulation of carbohydrate recognition as they allow to control the relative orientation of sugar ligands by light. In order to advance the possibilities of such an &#8220;optoglycomics&#8221; approach for the glycosciences, we have synthesized a biantennary glycocluster in which two glycoazobenzene antennas are conjugated to the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of a scaffold glycoside. Orthogonal isomerization of the photoswitchable units was made possible by the different conjugation of the azobenzene moieties via an oxygen and a sulfur atom, respectively, and the ortho&#8208;fluorination of one of the azobenzene units. This design enabled a switching cycle comprising the EE, EZ and the ZZ isomer. This is the first example of an orthogonally photoswitchable glycocluster. The full analysis of its photochromic properties included the investigation of the isolated glycoazobenzene antennas allowing the comparison of the intra&#8208; versus the intermolecular orthogonal photoswitching. The kinetics of the thermal relaxation were analyzed in detail. A molecular dynamics study shows that indeed, the relative orientation of the glycoantennas and the distances between the terminal sugar ligands significantly vary depending on the isomeric state, as intended.

Gearing up double&#8208;decker complexes. A prototype of a molecular gear has been synthesized in 12 steps, using a helical naphthalocyanine ligand as rotating cogwheels and a thioether octa&#8208;functionalized phthalocyanine as anchoring stator.







Abstract
This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2&#8201;%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55&#8201;%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper studies the process of eco&#8208;friendly microwave assisted synthesis of a material based on triazine compounds and the possibility of its use as part of a hybrid catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia under mild conditions by the NO3RR reaction.







Abstract
This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is a major contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. By reconstituting R&#8208;CI into artificial membrane vesicles and in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy, the effects of ROS are investigated. The activity of R&#8208;CI is reduced because of ROS, not only by damaging the enzyme but also by making the membrane more polar and protic.







Abstract
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CPL signal direction of cyclodextrins&#8208;pyrene co&#8208;assembly can be regulated through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;induced stacking transformation, demonstrating that (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;CPL of pyrene&#8208;pyrene excimer is originated from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformation in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively.







Abstract
Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenon of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.

         <title>Switchable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Sustainable Sulfonamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and scalable synthesis of sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, is achieved under aerobic conditions, at ambient temperature, in reusable choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. The interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the selected DESs drives the sulfonamide synthesis over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides.







Abstract
A sustainable and scalable protocol for synthesizing variously functionalized sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, has been developed using environmentally responsible and reusable choline chloride (ChCl)&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). In ChCl/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and ChCl/urea (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), these reactions yield up to 97&#8201;% under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2&#8211;12&#8197;h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug BMS&#8208;299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure's eco&#8208;friendliness is validated by quantitative metrics like the E&#8208;factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Benzene Valence Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valence isomers of benzene have long attracted both synthetic and theoretical chemists due to their unique bonding and chemical reactivity. What new chemistry can be unlocked by introducing isosteric boron and nitrogen atoms in these structures? This concept paper highlights the recent development of boron(B)&#8208;nitrogen(N)&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers, specifically, BN&#8208;Dewar benzene and BN&#8208;benzvalene.







Abstract
Benzene is one of the most ubiquitous structural motifs in chemistry. The valence isomers of benzene have also attracted synthetic chemists&#8217; attention due to their unique structures, bonding, and reactivity. We have been investigating boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers via photoisomerization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines. In this contribution, we summarize recent developments of these highly strained BN&#8208;heterocyclic compounds including their synthesis, characterization, proposed mechanism of formation, and their potential applications.

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Donepezil: A Green and Sustainable Strategy Featuring Heterogeneous Catalysis and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical, sequential, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil was developed using inexpensive precursors. Key elements included highly functional heterogeneous catalytic processes for condensation and hydrogenation, with water as the sole byproduct. Additionally, in&#8208;line treatments eliminated inhibitory factors, enabling seamless integration of the multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow reactions.







Abstract
An atom&#8208;economical sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil, a widely prescribed drug for Alzheimer's disease, was accomplished using inexpensive, commercially available precursors. This achievement was made possible by reconfiguring the synthetic route to include only heterogeneous catalytic addition and condensation reactions, with a particular emphasis on skeletal transformation and bond formation through hydrogenation processes. Notably, water was the sole byproduct in this synthesis. A crucial aspect of this work was the development of appropriate continuous&#8208;flow processes to achieve a one&#8208;flow synthesis. This was accomplished by implementing in&#8208;line treatments of the main reaction stream to eliminate inhibitory factors that could affect catalyst performance in the hydrogenation steps.

         <title>Isonitrile Photochemistry: A Functional Group Class Coming in from the Cold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from a historical background that acknowledges isonitriles as a neglected class of compounds due to their unpleasant smell and hardly controlled reaction conditions with open shell species, the present concept article aims at highlighting the seeds of the modern isonitrile photochemistry. Representative essential transformations achieved via either UV light irradiation or radical initiators at high temperatures are brought into play to draw a parallel with the current literature relying on the exploitation of visible light photochemical methods. Such a comparison points out the potential of this enabling technology to further expand the scope of isonitrile chemistry and the unmet challenges which makes it a very stimulating field.</dc:description>

         <title>Melanin and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanin is responsible, in Nature, for photoprotection, for this reason it is expected to be poorly photoreactive. However, the photo&#8208;reactivity of melanin and related materials is well documented. Here we discuss some relevant recent examples to demonstrate that, indeed, the actual mechanism of interaction of melanin with light is complex and still not completely understood. Photochemical and photothermal processes are involved, giving a contribution that strongly depends on light wavelength and intensity. Moreover, some interesting experiments demonstrated that photochemical reactivity of melanin related compounds is likely to be indirect, in the sense that the effect of light is to increase the number of radical species rather than creating photoreactive excited state. These suggestions open&#8208;up new perspectives in the interpretation of the role of melanin in photoprotection and in the design of new melanin based photoactive materials for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and nanomedicine. Further complication is given by the role of atmospheric oxygen and humidity in the photoinduced processes. Beside this complexity of behavior makes it difficult a systematic understanding of the interaction of melanin with light, it surely strongly contributes to make the properties of melanin and related materials unique.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Deconstructive Methoxylation of Arylalcohols &#8211; A Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a mechanistic investigation of a recently developed electrochemical method for the deconstructive methoxylation of arylalcohols. A combination of synthetic, electroanalytical, and computational experiments have been performed to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for fragmentation to occur. It was found that 2&#8208;arylalcohols undergo anodic oxidation to form the corresponding aromatic radical cations, which fragment to form oxocarbenium ions and benzylic radical intermediates via mesolytic cleavage, with further anodic oxidation and trapping of the benzylic carbocation with methanol to generate the observed methyl ether products. It was also found that the electrochemical fragmentation of 2&#8208;arylalkanols is promoted by structural features that stabilize the oxocarbenium ions and/or benzylic radical intermediates formed upon mesolytic cleavage of the aromatic radical cations. With an enhanced understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural features that promote fragmentation, it is anticipated that alternative electrosynthetic transformations will be developed that utilize this powerful, yet underdeveloped, mode of substrate activation.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8211;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange of Aryl Carbamates using Iridium(I) Complexes Bearing Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) via C&#8211;H activation constitutes an efficient method for the synthesis of isotopically&#8208;enriched compounds, which are crucial components of the drug discovery process and are extensively employed in mechanistic studies. A series of iridium(I) complexes, bearing a chelating phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, was designed and synthesized for application in the catalytic HIE of challenging N&#8208; and O&#8208;aryl carbamates. A broad range of substrates were labeled efficiently, and applicability to biologically&#8208;relevant systems was demonstrated by labeling an &#671;&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;derived carbamate with excellent levels of deuterium incorporation. Combined theoretical and experimental studies unveiled intriguing mechanistic features within this process, in comparison to C&#8211;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange catalysed by monodentate Ir(I) NHC/phosphine complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a solid&#8208;acid catalyzed aminolysis of epoxides under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. A titania&#8208;zirconia supported molybdenum oxide catalyst demonstrated exceptional substrate compatibility, enabling the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent yields with high catalyst durability. Characterization of the catalyst revealed the crucial role of the titania&#8208;zirconia ratio in optimizing its performance. Furthermore, this method was applied to the efficient, sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of a rivaroxaban intermediate (an oral anticoagulant and the first direct factor Xa inhibitor), combining a hydrogenation step with the aminolysis reaction without the need for intermediate isolation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Conformational Behaviour of Fluorinated Tetrahydrothiopyran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interactions played a significant role in stabilizing the axial fluorine orientation of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran, occasionally supported by stereoelectronic interactions. These combined forces were observed to stabilize less polar conformers of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyrans even in polar solutions. Both experimental and computational investigations were thoroughly conducted on a variety of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran derivatives.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive study on the conformational behavior of diversely substituted 4&#8208;fluorotetrahydrothiopyran derivatives. Through quantum chemical simulations including DFT as well as NBO and NPA analysis, we elucidate the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions, occasionally complemented by hyperconjugative interactions, in stabilizing axial fluorine conformers. Less polar conformers were occasionally obtained, attributed to the interplay of electrostatic and hyperconjugative interactions. Experimental validation through NMR spectroscopy aligns with the computational analysis, thus providing a coherent understanding of the structural dynamics of these compounds.

         <title>Recent Applications of Sulfonium Salts in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of sulfonium salts in organic synthesis has experienced a dramatic increase during the last years that can arguably be attributed to three main factors; the development of more direct and efficient synthetic methods that make easily available sulfonium reagents of a wide structural variety, their intrinsic thermal stability, which facilitates their structural modification, handling and purification even on large scale, and the recognition that their reactivity resembles that of hypervalent iodine compounds and therefore, they can be used as replacement of such reagents for most of their uses. This renewed interest has led to the improvement of already existing reactions, as well as to the discovery of unprecedented transformations; in particular, by the implementation of photocatalytic protocols. This review aims to summarize the most recent advancements on the area focusing on the work published during and after 2020. The scope of the methods developed will be highlighted and their limitations critically evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations of Crucial Factors for the Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization of Black Phosphorus (BP) using Perylene Diimide Derivatives for the Passivation of BP Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent functionalization of black phosphorus (BP) was studied with a scope of ten tailor&#8208;made perylene diimides (PDIs). A combination of UV/Vis&#8208;, fluorescence&#8208;, as well as Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the structural factors, which contribute to a pronounced PDI&#8208;BP interaction and thus support the protection of BP nanosheets against oxidative degradation. We were able to show, that water&#8208;soluble, amphiphilic PDIs with highly charged head groups can be used for the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of BP in aqueous media. Here, based on the hydrophobic effect, an efficient adsorption of the respective PDI molecules takes place and leads to the formation of a passivating film, yielding a considerable stabilization of the BP flakes under ambient conditions exceeding 30 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Steric and Electronic Properties of Hemilabile NHC ligands for Gold(I/III) Catalyzed Oxyarylation of Ethylene: A Computational Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies on 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of ethylene promoted by gold catalysts bearing hemilabile N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC^X) ligands were conducted by DFT calculations, exploring the whole catalytic cycle. After highest energy transition state (TS) barriers were located for NHC^N gold catalyst, and experimental results with different iodoarenes and alcohols rationalized, the study was extended to modified NHC^X catalysts, to observe how electronic and steric effects could affect the rate determining step TS. Electronic effects were investigated on NHC^X (X = H, N, O, P, and S), whereas steric effects emerged when comparing catalysts with different N&#8208;R groups (R = Dipp, Mes, tBu and Me). Finally, we suggest a different catalyst design based on N&#8208;aryl N&#8208;o&#8208;donor&#8208;aryl NHC, with different donors and NHC backbones to search for better performing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational screening two&#8208;dimensional conjugated microporous polymer applied in perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated microporous polymer with a structure of 2D nanosheets has been synthesized. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the Fermi level of this 2D polymer aligns well with perovskite absorber, and its conduction band is high enough to block electron transport to the anode. This 2D polymer is used to modify the hole transport layer, significantly improving its photoelectric properties, including enhanced hole mobility, matched energy level, and reduced recombination. Furthermore, the 2D polymer exhibits a mesoporous structure, allowing perovskite to fill into its loose framework, increasing the hole export area and providing a large hole transport flux. As a result, the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells enhances to 24.64% from 21.17% of control device without 2D conjugated microporous polymer. Given that this material can be synthesized on a large scale, this work has significant implications for the future development of 2D polymers in perovskite solar cells, potentially accelerating industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Enantioselective Triplet Radical Reaction on Metal: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition of Acylsilanes to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of acylsilanes has been developed. The conjugate acylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and aldehydes was promoted by a copper(I)/chiral NHC catalyst under visible&#8208;light irradiation for synthesizing various 2&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in enantioenriched forms. Mechanistic studies combining experiments and quantum chemical calculations indicated a reaction mechanism involving copper&#8208;to&#8208;acyl charge transfer (i.e., metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT)) excitation of an alkene&#8208;bound acylcopper complex. The MLCT excitation is followed by an electronical and geometrical change to generate a &#946;&#8208;radical&#8208;C&#8208;enolate&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;acyl complex with an acyl radical character, which undergoes facile C&#8211;C bond formation in the copper coordination sphere, affording the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition product.</dc:description>

         <title>High Yield of L&#8208;Sorbose via D&#8208;Glucose Isomerization in Ethanol over a Bifunctional Titanium&#8208;Boron&#8208;Beta Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization on Lewis acidic zeolite is a highly attractive avenue for sorbose production. But the L&#8208;sorbose yield is limited by the competing D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;D&#8208;fructose isomerization and reaction equilibrium. In this work, it is suggested that ethanol directs the glucose conformation for selective D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization. It also reacts with the produced L&#8208;sorbose to form ethyl&#8208;sorboside, which allows the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization to proceed beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limit.&#160; It is shown that a bifunctional zeolite Beta containing framework titanium (Ti) and boron (B) is a selective catalyst for this tandem reaction: Lewis acidic framework Ti catalyzes the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization via an intramolecular 5,1&#8208;hydride shift process as confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments followed by 13C&#8208;NMR, while weak Br&#248;nsted acid framework B selectively promotes the sorbose ketalization with ethanol. A remarkably high yield of L&#8208;sorbose with a high fraction of sugar (&gt;95%: 27% unreacted glucose, 11.4% fructose, 57% sorbose) was obtained after the mixture produced in ethanol was hydrolyzed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Effective Energy Barrier and Magnetic Blocking Temperature in Tetraoxolene Radical Coupled Dinuclear Dysprosium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A well&#8208;judged combination of a high axial ligand field and a bridging radical ligand in a dinuclear lanthanide complex provides a single&#8208;molecule magnet with a higher effective energy barrier for magnetic relaxation and blocking temperature compared to its non&#8208;radical analog due to significant magnetic exchange coupling between radical and Ln(III) ions. In this work, we report two chloranilate (CA) bridged dinuclear dysprosium complexes, [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA)Dy(bbpen)}] (1Dy) and [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA&#8226;)Dy(bbpen)}&#8208;{CoCp2}+] (2Dy), where 2Dy is the radical bridged Dy&#8208;complex obtained via the chemical reduction of bridging CA moiety (H2bbpen = N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine). The presence of high electronegative phenoxide moiety enhances the axial anisotropy of pseudo&#8208;square antiprismatic Dy(III) ions. The diffused spin of radical is efficiently coupled with anisotropic Dy(III) centres and decreases the quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) in the magnetic relaxation process. The magnetic relaxation of 1Dy follows Orbach, Raman, and QTM processes whereas for 2Dy it follows Orbach and Raman Processes. Due to less involvement of the QTM relaxation process, 2Dy shows a higher thermal energy barrier (Ueff = 700 K) and a high blocking temperature (6.7 K), compared to its non&#8208;radical analog. Remarkably, the radical coupled 2Dy complex shows the highest energy barrier among the radical bridged Dy(III)&#8208;based SMMs to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensionally Extending from 1D MX&#8208;Chain to Ladder and Nanotube Systems: Structural and Electronic properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular one&#8208;dimensional (1D) electron systems have attracted much attention due to their unique electronic state, physical and chemical properties derived from high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. Among 1D materials, mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged transition&#8208;metal chain complexes (MX&#8208;chains) based on coordination assemblies are currently of particular interest because their electronic properties, such as mixed&#8208;valence state and band gap, can be controlled by substituting components and varying configurations. In particular, chemistry has recently noted that dimensionally extending MX&#8208;chains through organic rung ligands can introduce and modulate electronic coupling of metal atoms between chains, i.e., interchain interactions. In this review, for the first time, we highlight the recent progress on MX systems from the viewpoint of dimensionally extending from 1D chain to ladder and nanotube, mainly involving structural design and electronic properties. Overall, dimensional extension can not only tune the electronic properties of MX&#8208;chain, but also build the unique platform for studying transport dynamics in confined space, such as proton conduction. Based on these features, we envision that the MX&#8208;chain systems provide valuable insights into deep understanding of 1D electron systems, as well as the potential applications such as nanoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have introduced Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes (ReL1 &#8208; ReL6) [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl] where N^N = extensive &#960; conjugated imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f]1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives that helps in strong DNA intercalation, enhanced photophysical behavior, increase the 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character of T1 state for PDT and high value of lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration. These complexes exhibited prominent intraligand/ligand&#8208;centered (&#960; &#8208; &#960;*/ 1LC) absorption bands at &#955; 260 &#8208; 350 nm and relatively weak metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (1MLCT) bands within the &#955; 350 &#8208; 550 nm range.

         <title>Copper&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated synthesis of sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework photocathodes for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sp2&#8208;carbon (sp2&#8208;c) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring distinctive &#960;&#8208;conjugated network structures, facilitate the migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers, rendering them exceptionally appealing for applications in photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, owing to the powdery nature of COFs, leaving anchor the sp2&#8208;c COFs powder tightly onto a conductive substrate challenging. Here, we propose a method for preparing photoactive substance&#8208;conductive substrate integrated photocathodes through copper surface&#8208;mediated knoevenagel polycondensation (Cu&#8208;SMKP), this approach results in a uniform and stable sp2&#8208;c COF film, directly grown on commercial copper foam (COFTh&#8208;Cu). The COFTh&#8208;Cu demonstrates a high H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of 56 &#956;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3 V versus RHE, sustaining stability for 12 hours. The as&#8208;prepared COFTh&#8208;Cu represents a 4.5&#8208;fold increase in current density compared to traditional spin&#8208;coating methods and outperforms most COF photocathodes without cocatalysts.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sp2-carbon (sp2-c) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring distinctive &#960;-conjugated network structures, facilitate the migration of photo-generated carriers, rendering them exceptionally appealing for applications in photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, owing to the powdery nature of COFs, leaving anchor the sp2-c COFs powder tightly onto a conductive substrate challenging. Here, we propose a method for preparing photoactive substance-conductive substrate integrated photocathodes through copper surface-mediated knoevenagel polycondensation (Cu-SMKP), this approach results in a uniform and stable sp2-c COF film, directly grown on commercial copper foam (COFTh-Cu). The COFTh-Cu demonstrates a high H2-evolution photocurrent density of 56 &#956;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3 V versus RHE, sustaining stability for 12 hours. The as-prepared COFTh-Cu represents a 4.5-fold increase in current density compared to traditional spin-coating methods and outperforms most COF photocathodes without cocatalysts. This innovative copper surface-mediated approach for preparing photocathodes opens up a crucial pathway towards the realization of highly active COF photocathodes&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the D&#8208;Band Center of Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To tackle the global energy scarcity and environmental degradation, developing efficient electrocatalysts is essential for achieving sustainable hydrogen production via water splitting. Modulating the d&#8208;band center of transition metal electrocatalysts is an effective approach to regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates, alter reaction pathways, lower the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, and ultimately improve electrocatalytic water splitting performance. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in modulating the d&#8208;band center for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting is offered. Initially, the basics of the d&#8208;band theory are discussed. Subsequently, recent modulation strategies that aim to boost electrocatalytic activity, with particular emphasis on the d&#8208;band center as a key indicator in water splitting are summarized. Lastly, the importance of regulating electrocatalytic activity through d&#8208;band center, along with the challenges and prospects for improving electrocatalytic water splitting performance by fine&#8208;tuning the transition metal d&#8208;band center, are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Encapsulation of Menthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of flavoring ingredients like menthol in the food industry is hindered by their high volatility and poor thermal stability, which lead to significant losses during processing and storage. Encapsulation of flavors into porous materials to obtain inclusion complexes (ICs) has proved to be an efficient strategy. In the present study, we synthesized a series of relatively food&#8208;safe three&#8208;dimensional anionic cyclodextrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (CD&#8208;COFs) with spiroborate linkages using a facile microwave&#8208;assisted method. The high surface area and newly formed cavitied of COFs significantly enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of menthol compared to native CD materials. Our findings revealed that &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li, with Li+ as the counterion, achieved superior encapsulation efficiency of 25.9%, outperforming &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Na, &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;K and &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li under the same conditions. Thermal stability measurements show that the menthol/&#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li&#8208;ICs effectively stabilize menthol against heat evaporation at elevated temperatures due to the strengthened interaction between menthol and &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li. The promising results of this research suggest that rapid advancements in COF technology will provide new opportunities for enhancing the stability of flavoring ingredients in the food industry.</dc:description>
