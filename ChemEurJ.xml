         <title>Detecting protein&#8208;ligand interactions with nitroxide based paramagnetic cosolutes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy&#8208;to&#8208;use NMR method for studying protein&#8208;ligand interactions is presented, relying on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements induced by soluble nitroxide molecules. The NMR method can be useful for detecting changes of the electrostatic potential of proteins triggered by ligand binding and for detecting the location of ligand binding sites.







Abstract
NMR spectroscopy techniques can provide important information about protein&#8208;ligand interactions. Here we tested an NMR approach which relies on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from analogous cationic, anionic or neutral soluble nitroxide molecules, which distribute around the protein&#8208;ligand complex depending on near&#8208;surface electrostatic potentials. We applied this approach to two protein&#8208;ligand systems, interleukin&#8208;8 interacting with highly charged glycosaminoglycans and the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacting with less charged phospho&#8208;tyrosine tripeptides. The electrostatic potential around interleukin&#8208;8 and its changes upon binding of glycosaminoglycans could be derived from the PRE data and confirmed by theoretical predictions from Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann calculations. The ligand influence on the PREs and NMR&#8208;derived electrostatic potentials of Grb2 SH2 was localized to a narrow protein region which allowed the localization of the peptide binding pocket. Our analysis suggests that experiments with nitroxide cosolutes can be useful for investigating protein&#8208;ligand electrostatic interactions and mapping ligand binding sites.

         <title>Energy Transfer on Cytoskeleton of Red Blood Cell Ghosts and their Efficiency Control by KCl Concentration&#8208;induced Cell Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a cytoskeleton network located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer. Their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as platforms for bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer using red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs) as scaffolds, relying on their asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.

         <title>Caged Dexamethasone to Photo&#8208;control the Development of Embryos through Activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient tools for controlling molecular functions with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution are much in demand to investigate biological processes in living systems. Here we report an easily synthesized caged dexamethasone for photo&#8208;activating cytoplasmic proteins fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the dark, it is stable in vitro as well as in vivo in both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus sp, two significant models of vertebrates. In contrast, it liberates dexamethasone upon UV illumination, which has been harnessed to interfere with developmental steps in embryos of these animals. Interestingly, this new system is biologically orthogonal to the one for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, which brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>Different Reaction Modes Operating in ansa&#8208;Half&#8208;Sandwich Magnesium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium&#8208;based catalysts are becoming popular for hydroelementation reactions specially using p&#8208;block reagents. Based on the seminal report from Sch&#228;fer&#8217;s group (ChemCatChem 2022, 14, e202201007), our study demonstrates that the reaction mechanisms exhibit a far greater degree of complexity than originally presumed. Magnesium has a variety of coordination modes (and access to different hybridizations) which allows this electron&#8208;deficient centre to modulate its catalytic power depending on the &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the reagent. DFT calculations demonstrate several reaction channels closely operating in these versatile catalysts. In addition, variations in limiting energy barriers resulting from catalyst modifications were examined as a function of the Hammett constant, thereby predicting enhanced efficiency in reaction conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Glycosylation, Functionalization and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This mini review article provides an overview on the use of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis, focusing on their chemistry and recent applications. HICs are similar to transition metals in their reactivity but have the added benefit of being environmentally benign, and are therefore commonly used as selective oxidants and eco&#8208;friendly reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we summarize various synthetic uses of hypervalent iodine reagents in reactions such as glycosylation, oxidations, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the advantages and versatility of using HICs as an environmentally sustainable alternative to heavy metals in carbohydrate chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed tandem asymmetric reactions were powerful tools to access various chiral compounds. Many strategies have been developed for the coupling of 1,n&#8208;dienes with aryl halides via a tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8208;Trost process. However, the control of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemistry remains a challenging task.

Domino Iron and Palladium Catalysis: An elegant synthetic approach to 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazoles via activation of six C&#8722;H bonds is described. The strategy consists of an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative homocoupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls followed by a twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
The iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls and subsequent twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization provide a convergent synthetic route to 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazoles. Screening a range of different palladium(II) salts led to palladium(II) acetate, pivalate, and hexafluoroacetylacetonate as the most efficient catalysts. Remarkably, the twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization can also be performed under argon. The mechanism for the oxidative cyclization under an inert gas presumably involves regeneration of the catalytically active palladium(II) species by oxidative addition of pivalic acid.

         <title>Electrophilic Functionalization of a Hexaphosphabenzene Ligand in [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8208;P6)]</title>

         <dc:description>
The reactivity of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)] with main group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is explored. These studies yield novel cationic derivatives of the isolobal P homolog of the ubiquitous benzene ligand, featuring group 14, 15, and 16 as well as mixed group 14/16 element substituents.







Abstract
The electrophilic functionalization of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)] (A) and its mono&#8208;oxidized counterpart [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;6:6&#8208;P6)][SbF6] (B) with reactive main&#8208;group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is shown to be a reliable method for the selective functionalization of the hexaphosphabenzene ligand. Depending on the electrophile used, the regioselectivity of the functionalization can be adjusted. Using group 16 electrophiles, the trisubstituted compounds [{Cp*Mo}2{(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;1,3&#8208;(SePh)2&#8208;2&#8208;Br&#8208;P3)}][TEF] (1), [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;(EPh)3&#8208;P3)][SbF6] (E=S (2), Se (3)) as well as the side product [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;P4)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P(SPh)2)][SbF6] (4) are obtained. By switching to phosphenium ions as group 15 electrophiles, the ring&#8208;inserted products [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P7R2)][TEF] (R=Cy (5), iPr (6)) are isolated, showing an unprecedented P7R2 structural motif. Furthermore, the reaction with MeOTf yields the dimeric [{Cp*Mo}4(1,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;&#956;4,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P6)(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)2][TEF]2 (7) as the first example of a complex featuring two interconnected cyclo&#8208;P6 middle deck ligands. Finally, by combination of the methylation step with Ph2Se2, the mixed group 14/16 complex [{Cp*Mo}2{(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;11,2&#8208;(SePh)2&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;P3)}][OTf] (8) is obtained.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Symmetrically Substituted Poly(3,4&#8208;Dimethylthiophene) as Cathode for Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addressing the stability challenges in aluminum ion batteries, this research employs poly(3,4&#8208;dimethylthiophene) (PDMT) as a cathode material. Innovatively modifying the thiophene ring with methyl groups, PDMT adjusts local charge density and electron delocalization, boosting electrochemical reactivity and cycling stability. Exhibiting an exceptional discharge capacity of 110 mAh g&#8208;1 and maintaining 92.7% capacity after 1000 cycles, PDMT outperforms traditional polythiophene cathodes.







Abstract
The aggravation of energy problems and the scarcity of lithium resources have forced us to look for new energy storage systems. Aluminum ion batteries, as a promising energy storage system, have the advantages of environmental friendliness and abundant aluminum resources, and have the potential for application in large&#8208;scale energy storage and personal portable electronic devices. To solve the stability problem of aluminum ion batteries during cycling for large&#8208;scale energy storage needs, we report a polythiophene&#8208;based conductive polymer, poly(3,4&#8208;dimethylthiophene) (PDMT), as a high performance cathode material for aluminum ion batteries. By introducing two methyl groups on the thiophene ring, we successfully adjust the local charge density of the heterocyclic thiophene, thus changing the electron delocalization characteristics, and improving the electrochemical reaction activity of the polythiophene (PTH) material as a redox electrode material. This also maintains the symmetry and regularity of the polymer structure, giving the material better cycling stability. The discharge specific capacity reaches 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, far exceeding conventional PTH cathodes (~70&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and the capacity retention rate is 92.7&#8201;% after 1000 cycles. It also shows excellent rate performance due to the flexible structure of the conductive polymer.

         <title>Reversible Restrain and Release of the Dynamic Valence Isomerization in a Shape&#8208;shifting Bullvalene by Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic valence isomerism of a bullvalene unit is tamed in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 chelate complex with Ag+, such that the bullvalene unit in the chelating ligand contains one predominant isomer at 5&#8201;&#176;C. In turn, in this completely reversible process, displacement of Ag+ from the complex with hexacyclene unleashes the dynamic interconversions of the bullvalene.







Abstract
In search for structural features that enable the control of the valence isomerization of the fluxional bullvalene, a bullvalene&#8208;bis(harmane) conjugate is identified that acts as chelating ligand in complexes with metal ions. Spectrometric titrations show that this ligand forms 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with Ag+, Cu+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. Most importantly, detailed NMR&#8208;spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures reveals that the complexation with Ag+ strongly affects the dynamic isomerization of the bullvalene unit of the ligand such that only one predominant valence isomer is formed, even at 5&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed 1H&#8208;NMR&#8208;spectroscopic studies disclose an increased barrier (~11&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) of the Cope rearrangement. Furthermore, the addition of hexacyclene displaces the Ag+ from the complex, so that the valence isomerization is accelerated and an equilibrium with two predominant isomers is formed. In turn, repeated addition of Ag+ regains the complex with the restrained isomerization of the bullvalene unit.

     alt="Reversible Restrain and Release of the Dynamic Valence Isomerization in a Shape-shifting Bullvalene by Complex Formation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic valence isomerism of a bullvalene unit is tamed in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 chelate complex with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, such that the bullvalene unit in the chelating ligand contains one predominant isomer at 5&#8201;&#176;C. In turn, in this completely reversible process, displacement of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from the complex with hexacyclene unleashes the dynamic interconversions of the bullvalene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In search for structural features that enable the control of the valence isomerization of the fluxional bullvalene, a bullvalene-bis(harmane) conjugate is identified that acts as chelating ligand in complexes with metal ions. Spectrometric titrations show that this ligand forms 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Most importantly, detailed NMR-spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures reveals that the complexation with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; strongly affects the dynamic isomerization of the bullvalene unit of the ligand such that only one predominant valence isomer is formed, even at 5&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR-spectroscopic studies disclose an increased barrier (~11&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the Cope rearrangement. Furthermore, the addition of hexacyclene displaces the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from the complex, so that the valence isomerization is accelerated and an equilibrium with two predominant isomers is formed. In turn, repeated addition of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regains the complex with the restrained isomerization of the bullvalene unit. This method to control the valence isomerism by straightforward chemical stimuli may be used to simplify structural analysis at elevated temperatures, i.&#8201;e. a feature not available so far with bullvalenes, and it may be employed as functional element in dynamic supramolecular assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon Materials for Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and preparation of biomass&#8208;derived porous carbon materials in recent five years was summarized. These carbon materials were briefly catalogized into two types, plant&#8208;derived and animal&#8208;derived carbon materials. Heteroatoms doping was illustrated with an emphasis on single&#8208;element doping and multi&#8208;element doping, respectively. The advantages of these porous carbon materials applicated in electrochemical energy storage devices, such as LIBs, SIBs, PIBs, and SCs were reviewed. The remaining challenges and prospects in the field were outlined.







Abstract
The environmental impact from the waste disposal has been widely concerned around the world. The conversion of wastes to useful resources is important for the sustainable society. As a typical family of wastes, biomass materials basically composed of collagen, protein and lignin are considered as useful resources for recycle and reuse. In recent years, the development of carbon material derived from biomasses, such as plants, crops, animals and their application in electrochemical energy storage have attracted extensive attention. Through the selection of the appropriate biomass, the optimization of the activation method and the control of the pyrolysis temperatures, carbon materials with desired features, such as high&#8208;specific surface area, variable porous framework, and controllable heteroatom&#8208;doping have been fabricated. Herein, this review summarized the preparation methods, morphologies, heteroatoms doping in the plant/animal&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials, and their application as electrode materials for secondary batteries and supercapacitors, and as electrode support for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The challenges and prospects for the controllable synthesis and large&#8208;scale application of biomass&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials have also been outlooked.

         <title>Synthesis of Superelastic, Highly Conductive Graphene Aerogel/Liquid Metal Foam and its Piezoresistive Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of its large specific surface area and numerous active sites, GA has been widely used in the field of electrochemistry. In this study, liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;modified graphene aerogels were fabricated and used to construct a flexible sensor for the first time. The good performance of the resulting sensor offers the potential for the practical application of flexible sensors.







Abstract
Graphene aerogel (GA) has important application potential as piezoresistive sensors due to its low density, high conductivity, high porosity, and good mechanical properties. However, the fabrication of GA&#8208;based sensors with good mechanical properties and excellent sensing performance is still challenging. Herein, liquid&#8208; metal&#8208;modified GAs (GA/LM) are proposed for the development of an excellent GA&#8208;based sensor. GA/LM with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected layered structure exhibits excellent compressive stress of 41&#8197;KPa and fast response time (&lt;20&#8197;ms). While generally flexible GA composites cannot be compressed beyond 80&#8201;% strain without plastic deformation, GA/LM demonstrates a high compressive strength of 60&#8197;kPa under a strain of 90&#8201;%. A real&#8208;time pressure sensor was fabricated based on GA/LM&#8208;2 to monitor swallowing, pulse beating, finger, wrist and knee bending, and even plantar pressure during walking. These excellent features enable potential applications in health detection.

         <title>Functionalized Polyamine Synthesis with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.







Abstract
Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. The limitation is attributed to the synthetic difficulty of accessing functionalized polyamines. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.

         <dc:description>
Multipurpose silver(III) fluoride. Access to the first silver(III) carbene complexes has been achieved by reaction of the fluoride [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] precursor with different imidazolium salts. The novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. This synthetic procedure is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Methanol to Formaldehyde Catalyzed by Iron Complex with N3S3&#8208;type Tripodal Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe3+ complex with N3S3&#8208;type tripodal ligand, which has two reversible Fe2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ redox couples in solution in CV, exhibited catalytic oxidation of CH3OH to HCHO under O2, which was studied structurally, spectroscopically, and electrochemically.







Abstract
A Fe3+ complex with N3S3&#8208;type tripod ligand, 1, reacts with O2 in CH3OH to generate formaldehyde, which has been studied structurally, spectroscopically, and electrochemically. Complex&#8197;1 crystallizes as an octahedral structure with crystallographic C3 symmetry around the metal, with Fe&#8208;N=2.2917(17) &#197; and Fe&#8208;S=2.3574(6) &#197;. UV&#8208;vis spectrum of 1 in CH3OH under Ar shows an intense band at 572&#8197;nm (&#1013; 4,100&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1), which shifts to 590&#8197;nm (&#1013; 2,860&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1) by the addition of O2, and a new peak appeared at 781&#8197;nm (&#1013; 790&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1). Such a spectral change is not observed in CH2Cl2. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 1 in CH2Cl2 under Ar gives reversible redox waves assigned to Fe2+/Fe3+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples at &#8722;1.60&#8197;V (&#916;E=69&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;E=71&#8197;mV) vs Fc/Fc+, respectively. In contrast, in CH3OH, the reversible redox waves, albeit accompanied by a positive shift of the Fe2+/Fe3+ couple, are observed at &#8722;1.20&#8197;V (&#916;E=85&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;E=64&#8197;mV) vs Fc/Fc+ under Ar. Interestingly, a catalytic current was observed for the CV of 1 in CH3OH in the presence of CH3ONa under Ar, when the sweep rate was slowed down.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex with N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-type tripod ligand, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, reacts with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH to generate formaldehyde, which has been studied structurally, spectroscopically, and electrochemically. Complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; crystallizes as an octahedral structure with crystallographic &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry around the metal, with Fe-N=2.2917(17) &#197; and Fe-S=2.3574(6) &#197;. UV-vis spectrum of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH under Ar shows an intense band at 572&#8197;nm (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt; 4,100&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which shifts to 590&#8197;nm (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt; 2,860&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) by the addition of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a new peak appeared at 781&#8197;nm (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt; 790&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Such a spectral change is not observed in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under Ar gives reversible redox waves assigned to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; couples at &#8722;1.60&#8197;V (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;=69&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;=71&#8197;mV) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; Fc/Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In contrast, in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH, the reversible redox waves, albeit accompanied by a positive shift of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; couple, are observed at &#8722;1.20&#8197;V (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;=85&#8197;mV) and &#8722;0.53&#8197;V (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;=64&#8197;mV) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; Fc/Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; under Ar. Interestingly, a catalytic current was observed for the CV of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH in the presence of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ONa under Ar, when the sweep rate was slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitable Blue TADF&#8208;Type Afterglow via Delicate Control of Excited States in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>

In contrast to blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials that require UVB excitation, this study reports visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate systems.







Abstract
Blue afterglow constitutes of one of the primary afterglow colors and can convert into other afterglow colors through energy transfer. The reported studies show the fabrication of blue afterglow emitters, but most of them are formed by room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence mechanism and require UVB lights as excitation source (these high&#8208;energy lights may damage organic systems). Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence type (TADF&#8208;type) afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. Tiny change of the substituents in BF2bdk system has been found to pose significant influence on excited state energy levels and consequently narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy of the system. As a result, both forward and reverse intersystem crossing have been accelerated, leading to the emergence of BF2bdk's TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in rigid crystalline matrices. The resultant TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials exhibit emission lifetimes of several hundred milliseconds, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24.7&#8201;% and display temperature responsive property.

         <title>Characterization and In Vitro Behavior of PEO Coated Mg Modified with Antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg gained significant attention as a candidate for implant materials. However, its use is limited due to corrosion process and pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The use of Mg&#8208;based biomaterials with a number of their advantageous properties are overshadowed by uncontrollable metal corrosion. Moreover, the use of implants goes alongside with the threat of pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity. To achieve a suitable level of anticorrosion protection phosphate and fluoride&#8208;phosphate electrolytes are used in the PEO process. Investigation of the surface thickness and morphology done by means of cross&#8208;section analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assay show precedence of the fluoride containing PEO coating and make it the material of choice for further modification with Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes. The presence of the complexes on the PEO surface is confirmed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) are used to estimate the complexes&#8217; chemical state and depth of penetration in the coating surface. Based on the results of antibacterial assay, the modified coatings are found to be active against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Deconstructing Best&#8208;in&#8208;Class Neoglycoclusters as a Tool for Dissecting Key Multivalent Processes in Glycosidase Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deconstructing for understanding: A structure&#8208;activity relationship study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors shed new lights on the contribution of chelation and statistical rebinding mechanisms underlying high multivalent effect in glycosidase inhibition. This experimental&#8211;theoretical approach provides insights from various dimensions (statistical, stoichiometric, electrostatics) and relevant guidelines for the design of optimized multivalent enzyme inhibitors.







Abstract
Multivalency represents an appealing option to modulate selectivity in enzyme inhibition and transform moderate glycosidase inhibitors into highly potent ones. The rational design of multivalent inhibitors is however challenging because global affinity enhancement relies on several interconnected local mechanistic events, whose relative impact is unknown. So far, the largest multivalent effects ever reported for a non&#8208;polymeric glycosidase inhibitor have been obtained with cyclopeptoid&#8208;based inhibitors of Jack bean &#945;&#8208;mannosidase (JB&#945;&#8208;man). Here, we report a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors. This approach provides a valuable tool to understand the complex interdependent mechanisms underpinning the inhibitory multivalent effect. Combining SAR experiments, binding stoichiometry assessments, thermodynamic modelling and atomistic simulations allowed us to establish the significant contribution of statistical rebinding mechanisms and the importance of several key parameters, including inhitope accessibility, topological restrictions, and electrostatic interactions. Our findings indicate that strong chelate&#8208;binding, resulting from the formation of a cross&#8208;linked complex between a multivalent inhibitor and two dimeric JB&#945;&#8208;man molecules, is not a sufficient condition to reach high levels of affinity enhancements. The deconstruction approach thus offers unique opportunities to better understand multivalent binding and provides important guidelines for the design of potent and selective multiheaded inhibitors.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Epoxidation of Cyclooctene on Surface Modified Ni Foam Using Water as Oxygen Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic strategy for highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene to the corresponding epoxide is demonstrated using Ni foam as electrocatalyst using water as the oxygen source. By controlling the hydrophobicity of the Ni foam surface the conversion of cyclooctene was substantially increased.







Abstract
Electrochemical epoxidation of olefins using water as an oxygen atom source is emerging as an alternative approach for an atom economic and sustainable method towards a highly selective synthesis of epoxides. We report an electrochemical procedure for epoxidation of cyclooctene using water as the sole oxygen atom source over a sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) modified nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 catalyst directly grown on Ni foam. The SDS modification facilitates the mass transfer of cyclooctene towards the anode, thus achieving a 2.5&#8208;fold higher conversion with more than 90&#8201;% selectivity towards the corresponding epoxide compared with pure Ni(OH)2 catalyst.

         <title>Controlling the Activation at NiII&#8722;CO22&#8722; Moieties through Lewis Acid Interactions in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nickel&#8208;carbonite complexes the degree of CO2 activation depends on the nature of the alkali metal counterion, the strength of its interaction with the carbonite unit &#8211; and thus its spacial separation &#8211; as well as on further polar entities in the second coordination sphere. This is also reflected in the reactivity towards electrophiles which lead to C&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Nickel complexes with a two&#8208;electron reduced CO2 ligand (CO22&#8722;, &#8220;carbonite&#8221;) are investigated with regard to the influence alkali metal (AM) ions have as Lewis acids on the activation of the CO2 entity. For this purpose complexes with NiII(CO2)AM (AM=Li, Na, K) moieties were accessed via deprotonation of nickel&#8208;formate compounds with (AM)N(iPr)2. It was found that not only the nature of the AM ions in vicinity to CO2 affect the activation, but also the number and the ligation of a given AM. To this end the effects of added (AM)N(R)2, THF, open and closed polyethers as well as cryptands were systematically studied. In 14 cases the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and correlations with the situation in solution were made. The more the AM ions get detached from the carbonite ligand, the lower is the degree of aggregation. At the same time the extent of CO2 activation is decreased as indicated by the structural and spectroscopic analysis and reactivity studies. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the coordinating AM Lewis acidic fragment withdraws only a small amount of charge from the carbonite moiety, but it also affects the internal charge equilibration between the LtBuNi and carbonite moieties.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin and Mediated Uptake of Fe(III) into the Green Seaweed Ulva</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fully enantioselective catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin employs polyene cyclization chemistry with a novel, regioselective terminator. The ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;transport studies demonstrate independence of iron uptake and morphogenic activity, suggesting the Fe(III)&#8208;complex of thallusin being of importance primarily for compound resorption.







Abstract
A fully enantioselective, catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin using polyene cyclization chemistry is reported. The synthesis features dedicated precursor design, introduction of a TMS&#8208;substituted arene as a regioselective terminator, very high enantiomer excess (ee) on gram scale, and productive scaffold functionalization. Furthermore, an ee determination methodology of thallusin samples was developed, and the ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;uptake studies demonstrated that the cellular uptake of iron facilitated by thallusin derivatives was independent of their morphogenic activity, suggesting their active import via siderophore transporters as a shuttle system.

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Cu, Fe, or Ni&#8208;doped Diamane Sheets: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals (Cu, Ni, Fe) can be introduced into diamane in a specific pattern. This process not only enhances the adsorption properties of the reactant but also optimizes the CO2 conversion reaction pathway and promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction. Overall, transition metal&#8208;doped diamane demonstrates promising potential in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Poor mass transfer behavior and inherent activity limit the efficiency of traditional catalysts in electrocatalyzing carbon dioxide reduction reactions. However, the development of novel nanomaterials provides new strategies to solve the above problems. Herein, we propose novel single&#8208;metal atom catalysts, namely diamane&#8208;based electrocatalysts doped with Cu, Fe, and Ni, explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We thoroughly investigated the doping pattern and energetics for different dopants. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the conversion process of CO2 to C1 or C2+ products, utilizing the free energy analysis of reaction pathways. Our results reveal that dopants could only be introduced into diamane following a specific pattern. Dopants significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption ability of diamane, with Fe and Ni proving notably more effective than Cu. After CO2 adsorption, Cu&#8208; and Fe&#8208;doped diamane prefer to catalyze CO2RR, while Ni&#8208;doped diamane favors hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The C&#8722;C coupling reaction on Cu&#8208;hollow diamane, Cu&#8208;bridge diamane, and Fe&#8208;hollow diamane tends to be from C2+ products. Among all examined catalysts, Cu&#8208;hollow diamane shows better electro&#8208;catalytic performance. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of and contributes to the development of diamane&#8208;based electro&#8208;catalysts for CO2RR.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Oxidation of Unprotected Aminoglycosides and Sugar Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of amino groups and phosphates in aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates allows direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation without the use of protecting groups. The site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin allowed the preparation of a set of 3&#8217;&#8208;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two show promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of complex biomolecules by transition metal&#8208;catalysis is highly warranted, but often thwarted by the presence of Lewis basic functional groups. This study demonstrates that protonation of amines and phosphates in carbohydrates circumvents catalyst inhibition in palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation. Both aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates, compound classes that up till now largely escaped direct modification, are oxidized with good efficiency. Site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin was used to prepare a set of 3&#8217;&#8208;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two showed promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.

         <title>Understanding the Chemical Bond in Semiconductor/MXene Composites: TiO2 Clusters Anchored on the Ti2C MXene Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of composites involving TiO2 nanoparticles supported on the Ti2C MXene is investigated by means first&#8208;principles calculations. The analysis of the structural, bonding, and electronic properties confirms the stability of these composites which may have implication in catalysis. The stability of the composites arises favorable interaction between the two components, involving significant charge transfer from the MXene surface to the (TiO2)n (n=5,10) clusters. The present findings provide a reference that can be useful in the design of these composites.







Abstract
First&#8208;principles calculations on titania clusters (TiO2)n (n=5 and 10) supported on the pristine Ti2C (0001) surface were carried out to understand the properties of semiconductor/MXene composites with implications in (photo)&#8208;catalysis. The reported results reveal a high exothermic interaction accompanied by a substantial charge transfer with a concomitant, notorious, deformation of the titania nanoclusters. The analysis of the density of states analysis of the composite systems evidences a metallic character with titania related states crossing the Fermi level. The picture of the chemical bonds is completed by the analysis of X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) features, evidencing clear shifts of the C(1s) and O(1s) related peaks relative to the isolated systems that have a quite complex origin. This detailed analysis provides insights to experimentalists interested in the design and synthesis of these systems with possible applications in catalysis.

The reported results reveal a high exothermic interaction accompanied by a substantial charge transfer with a concomitant, notorious, deformation of the titania nanoclusters. The analysis of the density of states analysis of the composite systems evidences a metallic character with titania related states crossing the Fermi level. The picture of the chemical bonds is completed by the analysis of X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) features, evidencing clear shifts of the C(1&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;) and O(1&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;) related peaks relative to the isolated systems that have a quite complex origin. This detailed analysis provides insights to experimentalists interested in the design and synthesis of these systems with possible applications in catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural insights into the semiquinone form of human Cytochrome P450 reductase by DEER distance measurements between a native flavin and a spin labelled non&#8208;canonical amino acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring dynamics is crucial for understanding Cytochrome P450 Reductase's electron transfer pathway. We innovatively studied its one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced state using non&#8208;canonical amino acid and a semi&#8208;reduced flavin. This novel approach enabled distance measurement by Double Electron Electron Resonance on this specific redox state for the first time. Together with Molecular Dynamics studies, we showed the existence of an ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; state of the protein.







Abstract
The flavoprotein Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is the unique electron pathway from NADPH to Cytochrome P450 (CYPs). The conformational dynamics of human CPR in solution, which involves transitions from a &#8220;locked/closed&#8221; to an &#8220;unlocked/open&#8221; state, is crucial for electron transfer. To date, however, the factors guiding these changes remain unknown. By Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling coupled to Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we have incorporated a non&#8208;canonical amino acid onto the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domains of soluble human CPR, and labelled it with a specific nitroxide spin probe. Taking advantage of the endogenous FMN cofactor, we successfully measured for the first time, the distance distribution by DEER between the semiquinone state FMNH&#8226; and the nitroxide. The DEER data revealed a salt concentration&#8208;dependent distance distribution, evidence of an &#8220;open&#8221; CPR conformation at high salt concentrations exceeding previous reports. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations which unveiled a diverse ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; semiquinone state of the CPR at high salt concentration. This study unravels the conformational landscape of the one electron reduced state of CPR, which had never been studied before.

         <title>Gas Evolution as a Tool to Study Reaction Kinetics Under Biomimetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of bioorthogonal chemistry is rapidly growing, presenting successful applications of organic and transition metal catalysed reactions in cells and living systems (in vivo). The development of such reactions typically proceeds through many iterative steps focused on biocompatibility and fast reaction kinetics to ensure product formation. However, obtaining kinetic data, even under simulated biological (biomimetic) conditions, remains a challenge due to substantial concentrations of salts and biomolecules hampering the use of typically employed solution&#8208;phase analytical techniques. In this study, we explored the suitability of gas evolution as a probe to study kinetics under biomimetic conditions. As proof of concept, we show that the progress of two transition metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal chemical reactions can be accurately monitored, regardless of the complexity of the medium. As such, we introduce a protocol to gain more insight into the performance of a catalytic system under biomimetic conditions to further progress iterative catalyst development for&#160;in vivo&#160;applications</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Inorganic Core of a reduced Ni2Ge2 Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetranuclear cores (M&#8211;E)2 of transition metals (M) and tetrylenes (EII = Si, Ge, Sn) are key motifs in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They exhibit a continuum of M&#8211;M and E&#8211;E bonding within the inorganic core that leads to a variety of structures for which there are no specific synthetic methods. Herein, we report a series of highly reduced [Ni0GeII]2 squares solely stabilized by bulky terphenyl (C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Ar2) ligands, for which we provide complementary and high&#8208;yielding syntheses. Reactivity studies with common Lewis bases (carbene and CO) evince that the structure of the (M&#8211;E)2 core can be finely tuned. We have investigated this core modification by computational means, offering a rationale to better understand the continuum of bonding across these clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperation between p&#8208;Block Elements and Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Stoichiometric and Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Ignoble&#8221; prized: The use of redox&#8208;active ligands that behave as electron reservoirs and are able to donate or accept electrons on demand during a catalytic cycle has emerged as a powerful approach to engage cheap early transition metals in catalytic transformations traditionally reserved for their &#8220;noble cousins&#8221;. This concept article explores the possibilities that are opened by the extrapolation of that strategy to the design of catalysts based on p&#8208;block elements.







Abstract
The relevance acquired by redox&#8208;active ligands in modern catalysis stems from their facile delivery and acceptance of electrons, either to the metal they coordinate to, or directly to an incoming substrate that also binds the central metal. Doing that, they generate coordinated radicals and provide access to more than one spin state during the catalytic cycle. As a consequence, the new reaction barriers are reduced when compared to similar processes that are restricted to a single spin surface. The principles that govern this genuine approach to catalyst design are well&#8208;established, and their implementation has allowed the development of synthetically useful catalytic transformations; however, the extension of the concept to species in which p&#8208;block elements take the role of central atoms remains largely underdeveloped. Through discussion of the key achievements and recent progress, this Concept Article highlights this original approach to designing (organo)catalysts, discloses the progress achieved, and also reveals the many shortcomings that still exist in the field.

         <title>Study on the epoxidation of chain olefins using biquaternary ammonium phosphotungstic acid phase transfer catalysts under no&#8208;solvent condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phase transfer catalyst comprising phosphotungstic acid and biquaternary ammonium cation salt is synthesized for the epoxidation of long carbon chain olefins under solvent&#8208;free conditions, which exhibits high selectivity for epoxides. Different methods are used to characterize the fundamental structure and catalytic mechanism of this catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we have developed a novel catalyst synthesized by phosphotungstic acid and a gemini quaternary ammonium cation salt. This quaternary ammonium salt not only reduces the interfacial tension between olefins and hydrogen peroxide but also forms a notably stable structure with phosphotungstic acid. Dodecene was successfully epoxidized to epoxy dodecane with a selectivity of 82.9&#8201;%. The impact of initial conditions was systematically investigated such as molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the catalytic performance. Characterization of the catalyst morphology was performed by SEM, TEM and SAXS. Raman spectra, FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra were employed to perform the catalyst transformation during the epoxidation reaction. This catalytic mechanism study could provide the industrial application in the epoxidation of long&#8208;chain olefins.

         <title>Annulation of a Methylenecyclopropane with Cyanoalkenes Catalyzed by Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare intermolecular annulation of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes with alkenes has been developed by using a methylenecyclopropane (MCP) and acyl cyanoalkenes to give dihydrofurans or furans. The dihydrofurans were synthesized in the presence of a catalytic amount of the base and were readily converted to the furans by using a stoichiometric amount of the base. A 1H&#8197;NMR study revealed that the ring&#8208;opened MCP reacts with the alkenes.







Abstract
The annulation of a methylenecyclopropane with acyl cyanoalkenes by using DABCO or quinuclidine as a catalyst to give 2,3&#8208;dihydofurans has been developed. A stoichiometric amount of the Lewis bases promoted the isomerization of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans to furans. 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of the reaction in&#8197;situ revealed that the methylenecyclopropane is opened by the Lewis base to form a reaction intermediate that is added to the cyanoalkenes.

         <title>Anode Reaction Control for a Single&#8208;Compartment Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reactor with a Surface&#8208;Activated Diamond Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated anode reaction control for a membrane&#8208;free single&#8208;compartment carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) flow reactor with a boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrode. Fluorinated polymer coatings over an IrO2 electrode improved the selectivity of anode reactions. The use of a halogen free electrolyte and the activation of BDD cathode improved the CO2R reaction selectivity and achieved a Faradaic efficiency of formic acid of over 70&#8201;%.







Abstract
The electrochemical reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in aqueous electrolyte solutions is attracting increasing attention for sustainable chemical production. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have been previously shown to be very effective for the stable electrochemical production of formic acid from CO2. Typically, the electrochemical production of formic acid by CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction is performed with a dual&#8208;compartment flow reactor equipped with a membrane separator. The problems caused by the membrane separator, such as scaling&#8208;up, complicated operational control and materials costs can be solved using a membrane free single&#8208;compartment reactor. Here we demonstrate anode reaction control for a single&#8208;compartment CO2R flow reactor using a surface&#8208;activated BDD cathode and achieve a Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production of over 70&#8201;%.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Electron Fluctuation&#8208;Induced P+/C&#8722; Ambiphilic Interaction for Intramolecular CAr&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

An unexpected C&#8722;H bond activation promoted us to re&#8208;visit the reaction mechanism with 2H&#8208;phosphindole, and further theoretical studies led to finding that within a five&#8208;membered ring, the polarizable PC3 unit orchestrates the formation of a transient P+/C&#8722; ambiphilic species, which responsible for the C&#8722;H bond activation. This work provides mechanistic insights into the previously reported regioselective [4+2] cycloadditions with 2H&#8208;phosphindoles also.







Abstract
Herein, we describe how computational mechanistic understanding has led directly to the discovery of new 2H&#8208;phosphindole for C&#8722;CAr bond activation and dearomatization reaction. We uncover an unexpected intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation with a 2H&#8208;phosphindole derivative. This new intriguing experimental observation and further theoretical studies led to an extension of the reaction mechanism with 2H&#8208;phosphindole. Through DFT calculations, we confirm that within a five&#8208;membered ring, the polarizable PC3 unit orchestrates the formation of an electrophilic phosphorus atom (P+) and a nucleophilic carbon atom (C&#8722;). This kinetically accessible ambiphilic phosphorus/carbon couple is spatially separated by geometric constraints, and their reactivity is modulated through structural resonance.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Special Synergy of Bimetallic Site in Co/MoC Catalyst to Promote N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>

The introduced Co atom does not directly participate in binding with intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. DFT results reveal that by maintaining the good activity of N&#8722;N bond cleavage and the stability of intermediates on &#945;&#8208;MoC(0001) surface, the formation of NHx species is promoted by reducing the migration barrier of H atom after introducing Co atom.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanisms of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on the pristine and Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) surfaces were explored by density functional theory calculations. The results show that the preferred pathway is that a direct N&#8801;N cleavage occurs first, followed by continuous hydrogenations. The production of second NH3 molecule is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step on both systems with kinetic barriers of 1.5 and 2.0&#8197;eV, respectively, indicating that N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation on bimetallic surface is more likely to occur. The two components of the bimetallic center play different roles during NRR process, in which Co atom does not directly participate in the binding of intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. This special synergy makes Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) have superior activity for ammonia synthesis. The introduction of Co not only facilitates N2 dissociation, but also accelerates the migration of H atom due to the antibonding characteristic of Co&#8722;H bond. This study offers a facile strategy for the rational design and development of efficient catalysts for ammonia synthesis and other reactions involving the hydrogenation processes.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Silylated Vinylboronates by a Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction and Their Application to Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrasubstituted silylated pinacol vinylboronates and trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA&#8208;boronates was synthesized by using the boron&#8208;Wittig approach. By using this protocol, the boryl and the silyl groups can be directly and highly stereoselectively incorporated into the olefin&#8216;s anti&#8208;position. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling of the silylated vinyl boronates allows access to several all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, anticancer drug Tamoxifen, and AIEgen agent TPE&#8208;TF17.







Abstract
The highly stereoselective synthesis of a series of tetrasubstituted mono&#8208; as well as disilylated vinylboronates is reported by using the boron&#8208;Wittig approach. The condensation between acylsilanes and gem&#8208;diborylalkanes gave the desired tetrasubstituted olefins in good to excellent yield and high stereoselectivity. Also, a series of trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA&#8208;boronates was synthesized by using the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction followed by a transesterification reaction. This methodology allows direct incorporation of B(pin) and TMS groups in the anti&#8208;position of the olefin in a highly stereoselective manner. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling reaction with the silylated vinyl boronic esters generated all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, which have been applied in the total synthesis of the anticancer drug Tamoxifen and aggregation&#8208;induced luminogen agent TPE&#8208;TF17.

The condensation between acylsilanes and gem-diborylalkanes gave the desired tetrasubstituted olefins in good to excellent yield and high stereoselectivity. Also, a series of trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA-boronates was synthesized by using the boron-Wittig reaction followed by a transesterification reaction. This methodology allows direct incorporation of B(pin) and TMS groups in the &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-position of the olefin in a highly stereoselective manner. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling reaction with the silylated vinyl boronic esters generated all-carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, which have been applied in the total synthesis of the anticancer drug Tamoxifen and aggregation-induced luminogen agent TPE-TF17.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scaffold Editing of Cubanes into Homocubanes, Homocuneanes via Cuneanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When benzoyl triflate was used as a catalyst on acyloxymethylcubane, a ring expansion of one carbon atom proceeded, resulting in the efficient production of acyloxymethylhomocubane. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;diacyloxymethylcubane resulted in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. Similarly, 2&#8208;acyloxymethylcuneane can also be converted into acyloxycuneane. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol and homocuneanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of cage&#8208;type hydrocarbons through the editing of the highly symmetric molecule cubane can be anticipated as one of the efficient approaches. In this paper, we identify a catalyst that facilitates the efficient scaffold isomerization of cubanes into homocubanes. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;bis(acyloxymethl)cubane results in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. The same catalyst was also applied to the isomerization of acyloxymethylcuneanes, producing homocuneanol esters.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Detection of Unbound Bilirubin and Nitrophenol Explosives in Water by a Mechanosynthesized Dual Functional Zinc Complex: Recognition of Picric Acid in Various Common Organic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>

This article describes label&#8208;free instant dual detection of unconjugated bilirubin and picric acid in pure aqueous solution by a mechanosynthesized luminescent zinc(II) complex, which can be performed via pH tuning of the medium.







Abstract
High levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UB) in serum lead to asymptomatic and neonatal jaundice and brain dysfunctions. Herein, we have reported the detection of UB at as low as 1&#8197;&#956;M in an aqueous alkaline medium using a Zn(II) complex. The specificity of the complex has been validated by the HPLC in the concentration window 6&#8211;90&#8197;&#956;M, which is rare. The sensory response of the probe at physiological pH against nitro explosives developed it as an instant&#8208;acting fluorosensor for picric acid (PA) and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol (2,4&#8208;DNP). Spectroscopic titration provided a binding constant of 4&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 with PA. The naked eye detection was found to be 15&#8197;&#956;M. The solid&#8208;state photoluminescent nature of the complex enabled it for PA sensing in the solid phase. Interestingly, the probe remained fluorescent in various volatile and non&#8208;volatile organic solvents. As a result, it can also detect PA and 2,4&#8208;DNP in a wide range of common organic media. NMR studies revealed the coordination of PA, 2,4&#8208;DNP, and UB to the Zn(II) center of the probe, which is responsible for the observed quenching of the probe with the analytes.

         <title>A pseudo&#8208;Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Built upon Layered Double Hydroxides with Self&#8208;Strengthening Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) hydrogels, possessing a pseudo&#8208;double&#8208;network, have been constructed on the basis of dynamic covalent bonds, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The as&#8208;prepared nanocomposite hydrogels can retain more than 99&#8197;wt.% of water and exhibit a self&#8208;strengthening phenomenon, which originates from the inherent dynamic interactions, after mechanical training.







Abstract
While great achievements have been made in the development of mechanically robust nanocomposite hydrogels, incorporating multiple interactions on the bases of two demensional inorganic cross&#8208;linkers to construct self&#8208;strengthening hydrogels has rarely been investigated. To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions within a pseudo double&#8208;network system. The pseudo first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris&#8208;modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8722;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non&#8208;covalent interactions between Tris&#8722;LDHs and poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8722;propanesulfonate) (p&#8208;(AM&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9&#8197;wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90&#8201;% of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self&#8208;strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.

         <title>Unexpected Low Temperature Activity with Low N2O Emission of Stabilized Al&#8208;rich Zeolite Beta for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the use of liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment, Fe&#8208;containing beta zeolite catalysts show improved NOx conversions at low temperature regions and better hydrothermal stability while maintaining high selectivity due to the reorganization of Al framework. (FB: Fe&#8208;beta, &#8208;st: stabilized sample).







Abstract
The low temperature activity of Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites as selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR) catalysts is a critical drawback for practical application. Here, we found unexpected improvement of low temperature activity by our proposed post&#8208;synthetic treatment. An Al&#8208;rich zeolite beta (Si/Al=5) is employed as the catalyst support, and the parent sample is dealuminated for higher hydrothermal stability, followed by the liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment and impregnation. It is found that stabilized samples feature excellent low temperature activity and high N2 selectivity even for a long&#8208;term operation, along with the ability to maintain high NOx conversion after aging. The improved SCR activity should be attributed to abundant acid sites in Al&#8208;rich framework and better stabilization of monomeric iron species after the stabilization treatment. Furthermore, the low yield of side product N2O is probably due to the absence of the generation of NH4NO3 during NH3&#8208;SCR catalyzed by Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites.

         <title>Aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization by Consecutive Paired Electrolysis: Dibromination of Aryl Amines with Dibromoethane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient one&#8208;pot bromination protocol for aryl amines has been developed under metal and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions employing constant current electrolysis at room temperature. The developed methodology uses electrically generated bromine from dibromoethane and carried out regioselective bromination of a wide range of aryl amines without the help of any additional activator.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a facile and efficient electrochemical method for the dibromination of aryl amines by double functionalization of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H (both para and ortho) under metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions at room temperature for the first time. The reaction is demonstrated using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to dibrominate a wide range of N&#8208;substituted aryl amines in a simple setup with C(+)/Pt(&#8722;) electrodes under mild reaction conditions. This transformation proceeds smoothly with a broad substrate scope affording the valuable and versatile N&#8208;substituted 2,4&#8208;dibromoanilines in moderate to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. In this paired electrolysis, cathodic reduction of 1,2&#8208;DBE followed by anodic oxidation generates bromonium intermediates, which then couple with anilines to furnish the dibrominated products. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The versatility of the electrochemical ortho&#8208;, para&#8208;dibromination was reflected by unique regioselectivities for challenging aryl amines and gram&#8208;scale electrosynthesis without the use of a stoichiometric oxidant or an activating agent.

         <title>Multielectron Redox Afforded by a Pincer Ligand Promoting Kumada Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>

A nickel&#8208;catalysed sp2&#8208;sp2 cross&#8208;coupling, that involves redox non&#8208;innocence of a NNN pincer ligand backbone is described.







Abstract
The redox&#8208;active nature of a pincer has been exploited to conduct C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions. A nickel complex with a NNN pincer was dimeric in the solid state, and the structure displayed a Ni2N2 diamond core. In the dimeric structure, both ligand backbones house an electron, in the iminosemiquinonate form, to keep the metal's oxidation state at +2. In the presence of an aryl Grignard reagent, only 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading the nickel complex generates a Kumada cross&#8208;coupled product in good yield from a wide variety of aryl&#8208;X (X= I, Br, Cl) substrates. That the ligand&#8208;based radical remains responsible for promoting such a coupling reaction following a radical pathway is suggested by TEMPO quenching. Furthermore, a radical&#8208;clock experiment along with tracing product distribution unambiguously supported the radical's involvement through the catalytic cycle. A series of thorough mechanistic probation, including computational DFT analysis, disclosed the cooperative action of both redox&#8208;active pincer ligand and the metal centre to drive the reaction.

         <title>Unlocking same&#8208;sign CPL: solvent effects on spectral form and racemisation kinetics in nine&#8208;coordinate chiral europium(III) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the importance and role of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) transitions in their emission profile. It is key to investigate the effect of these fundamental physical and environmental factors on the shape, sign and magnitude of CPL active luminescent transitions. Increased understanding of this could lead to novel, bright europium(III) complexes with monosignate individual CPL transitions to be designed for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging.







Abstract
Understanding the factors that shape the circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) emission profiles of europium(III)&#8208;based CPL emitters to have specific sign properties, e.&#8201;g. monosignate individual CPL transitions, is key to design novel complexes for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging. In order to correlate structure and spectral characteristics, a photophysical and kinetic investigation has been conducted on a series of coordinatively saturated nine&#8208;coordinate europium(III) systems based on 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane. We highlight that lanthanide emission is sensitive to changes in the ligand field by showing the linear dependence of total emission intensity ratios as a function of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying an internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state. This sensitivity increases by a factor of 20 when studying changes in CPL spectra, rendering these complexes accurate probes of local polarity. Solvent polarity, solvent&#8208;specific effects, and the nature of the chromophores&#8217; coordinating donor atoms strongly influence the kinetic stability of europium(III) complexes with respect to enantiomer interconversion. Notably, we show that the choice of donor groups to coordinating to europium(III) and the nature and polarity of the solvent affects the rate of racemisation, leading to systems with very long half&#8208;lives at room temperature in non&#8208;polar media.

         <title>Oxazaborolidinones: Steric Coverage Effect of Lewis Acidic Boron Center in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxamide moiety of oxazaborolidinone (OxB) dynamically covers the Lewis acidic boron center, providing stabilizing effects on unstable boronic acids including 2&#8208;furyl, vinyl, and alkyl groups and protective effects on OxB with haloaryl groups. Reported protection is useful for iterative couplings and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions with OxBs prepared from unstable arylboronic acids.







Abstract
It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide is an excellent boron&#8208;protecting group. The reaction between &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide and organoboronic acids produced stable oxazaborolidinones (OxBs), in which the 
&#8208;hybridized boron atom was sterically protected by &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide. The alkyl groups of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety can dynamically cover the p&#8208;orbital of the 
&#8208;hybridized boron center, creating a small space around the boron atom, allowing for smooth transmetalation by a Pd catalyst and easy deprotection by water. This protecting phenomenon is effective for readily purification, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions with unstable boronic acids and iterative cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Study on the Theranostic Potential of 177Lu&#8208;labeled Biocompatible Covalent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Targeted Radionuclide Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed to employ covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) as nanocarriers to obtain 177Lu radiolabeled nanoparticles with reliable cancer theranositic functions. The effective tumor targeting and impressive antitumor efficacy of as&#8208;synthesized theranostic agents (177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs) were demonstrated by systematic in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo anticancer investigations: a) 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs were equipped with excellent capacity of bonding with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS); b) notable accumulation of 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs at tumor site in 4T1 tumor bearing model was revealed by SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution; c) 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation (177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs) for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in&#8197;vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in&#8197;vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended.

&lt;p&gt;We proposed to employ covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) as nanocarriers to obtain &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu radiolabeled nanoparticles with reliable cancer theranositic functions. The effective tumor targeting and impressive antitumor efficacy of as-synthesized theranostic agents (&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs) were demonstrated by systematic &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; anticancer investigations: a) &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs were equipped with excellent capacity of bonding with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS); b) notable accumulation of &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs at tumor site in 4T1 tumor bearing model was revealed by SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution; c) 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 3&#8197;months.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation (&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs) for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

         <title>Size Determination of Organic Cages by Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size matters: In a systematic study, a series of organic cages was synthesized, and their molecular size and mass were determined by diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). Specific effects of window size and rigid exohedral functionalization revealed insight into structure&#8208;diffusion relationships, which could be transferred to literature&#8208;known cages and aid for the precise structure elucidation and property prediction of future cages.







Abstract
Reliable structure elucidation of covalent organic cage compounds remains challenging as routine analysis might leave ambiguities. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows insight into the molecular size and mass of the species present in solution, but a systematic evaluation of the diffusion behavior for cage assemblies is rarely considered. Here we report the synthesis of four series of covalent organic cages based on tribenzotriquinacenes and diboronic acids with varying geometry and exohedral substituents. We provide a guideline for the consistent measurement of diffusion coefficients from 1H&#8208;DOSY&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, which was utilized to study the diffusion behavior for the whole set of cages and selected examples from the literature. For structurally similar cages, a linear correlation between the solvodynamic volume and the molecular mass allows precise size determination. For more complex systems, multiple parameters, such as window size or rigid exohedral functionalization. further modulate cage diffusion in solution.

         <title>Post&#8208;device Dimethylamine Treatment Enables Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethylamine (DMA) is introduced as a post&#8208;treatment vapor to modify perovskite solar cells by a controlled low&#8208;dimensional perovskite formation process, thus reduce interface defects, hinder ion migration, provide a protective layer to inhibit invasion of water, suppress the escape of volatile ingredients. This DMA post&#8208;treatment enables the enhancement of both efficiency and stability of devices.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic ligands via post&#8208;device treatment is an effective strategy to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although the active area is protected by metal electrode under post&#8208;treatment, the aggression of post&#8208;treatment ligands into active area cannot be avoided thoroughly. Unfortunately, the size of long&#8208;chain amines is too large, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite cannot maintain its 3D perovskite structure once the cation substitution occurs during the post&#8208;treatment. Despite that the low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites are beneficial to stability, long&#8208;chain amines are harmful to carrier transport in PSCs. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA), a slightly oversized cation that can be doped into 3D perovskite structure, for post&#8208;device treatment to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. After exposure to DMA gas, the inactive area of Cs/FA/MA mixed cation perovskite device that is not covered by metal electrode is converted into LD perovskite, passivating the defects of 3D perovskite in the active region, suppressing non&#8208;radiation recombination and ion migration. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.29&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis and better stability after DMA post&#8208;treatment, which is much higher than that (20.40&#8201;%) of the control device.

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2 Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes based on MACHO ligand scaffolds produce in their activated amido form stable CO2 adducts, which comprise a 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;O} metallacyclic core. The CO2 adducts generally exhibit a reactivity tamed down as compared to the parent complexes. As masked forms of the catalytically competent amido species, these adducts may have important implications as off&#8208;loop species in carbon dioxide conversion.







Abstract
Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2 to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R=isopropyl&gt;adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.

         <title>Electrochemical N&#8208;Aroylation of Sulfoximines by Using Benzoyl Hydrazines with H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developed here is an electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine with the evolution of N2 and H2 as innocuous by&#8208;products, which can be utilized as a clean energy source. This approach features mild, operational simplicity, and remarkable scope of complex and sensitive pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Developed here is a robust electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine via concomitant cleavage and formation of C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds with the evolution of H2 and N2 as innocuous by&#8208;products. This sustainable protocol avoids the use of toxic reagents and occurs at room temperature. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an aroyl and a sulfoximidoyl radical via anodic oxidation under constant current electrolysis (CCE), affording N&#8208;aroylated sulfoximine. The strategy is applied to late&#8208;stage sulfoximidation of L&#8208;menthol, (&#8722;)&#8208;borneol, D&#8208;glucose, vitamin&#8208;E derivatives, and marketed drugs such as probenecid, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ciprofibrate, and sulindac. In addition, the present methodology is mild, high functional group tolerance with broad substrate scope and scalable.

The strategy is applied to late-stage sulfoximidation of L-menthol, (&#8722;)-borneol, D-glucose, vitamin-E derivatives, and marketed drugs such as probenecid, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ciprofibrate, and sulindac. In addition, the present methodology is mild, high functional group tolerance with broad substrate scope and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;anchored COF (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) represents a unimolecular heterogeneous metallaphotocatalysis system, adept at efficient C&#8722;P bond construction. The synthesized photocatalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving up to a 95&#8201;% yield. Furthermore, it exhibits a broad substrate scope and tolerance for various functional groups. Notably, this metallaphotocatalytic system has been found to process aryl bromides seamlessly, yielding products previously unreported in similar systems.







Abstract
The urgent need to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing organophosphine compounds is underscored by their extensive applications in organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and photoelectric materials. Metalated covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which seamlessly integrate the inherent photo properties of COF with the catalytic capabilities of metal ions, offer an optimal material for efficient transformation of organics sustainably. In this study, we introduce a simple COF with nickel anchorages (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) as a unimolecular metallaphotocatalytic system for effective C&#8722;P bond formation. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving yields of up to 95&#8201;%, and demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and functional group reactivity. Notably, the metallaphotocatalytic system has demonstrated the capability to process aryl bromides to produce the desired product, a feat not previously reported. Finally, the production and reusability test at the gram scale attests to its superior practicality for designing future organic cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;hydride under oriented external electric fields: a new strategy to modulate its reactivity?</title>

Cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;hydride under electric fields: The effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on the geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity of a potential antitumor drug, namely a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex has been systematically investigated on the basis of the density functional theory.







Abstract
Selected gold complexes have been regarded as promising anti&#8208;cancer agents because they can bind with protein targets containing thiol or selenol moieties, but their clinical applications were hindered by the unbiased binding towards off&#8208;target thiol&#8208;proteins. Recently, a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex (abbreviated as 1) with visible light&#8208;induced thiol reactivity has been reported as potent photo&#8208;activated anticancer agents (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 132, 11139). To explore new strategies to stimuli this potential antitumor drug, the effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on its geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity was systematically investigated. Results reveal that imposing external electric fields along the Au&#8722;H bond of 1 can effectively activate this bond, which is conducive to its dissociation and the binding of Au site to potential targets. Hence, this study provides a new OEEF&#8208;strategy to activate this reported gold(III)&#8208;hydride, revealing its potential application in electrochemical therapy. We anticipate this work could promote the development of more electric field&#8208;activated anticancer agents. However, further experimental research should be conducted to verify the conclusions obtained in this work.

         <title>Autocatalysis in Eschenmoser Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piecing the puzzle together. Mass spectrometry reveals the autocatalytic behavior of the Eschenmoser coupling reaction. Combining the results from ESI&#8208;MS coupled with various add&#8208;on methods, such as IR spectroscopy, ion mobility, or flow chemistry, leads to a comprehensive view of the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The Eschenmoser coupling reaction (ECR) of thioamides with electrophiles is believed to proceed via thiirane intermediates. However, little is known about converting the intermediates into ECR products. Previous mechanistic studies involved external thiophiles to remove the sulfur atom from the intermediates. In this work, an ECR proceeding without any thiophilic agent or base is studied by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry. ESI&#8208;MS enables the detection of the so&#8208;far elusive polysulfide species Sn, with n ranging from 2 to 16 sulfur atoms, proposed to be the key species leading to product formation. Integrating observations from ion mobility spectrometry, ion spectroscopy, and reaction monitoring via flow chemistry coupled with mass spectrometry provides a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and uncovers the autocatalytic nature of the ECR reaction.

An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes using an &#8220;ambident anthracene&#8221; building block is presented. For that purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is the longest&#8208;chain iptycene synthesized so far.

         <title>Conformer aggregates exhibit dual wavelength emissions on chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylenes and acetone detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene derivatives were synthesized, characterized by the distorted structures with local conjugation&#8208;induced rigidity, thus allowing excellent dual state emission. Upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, likely resulting in the dual wavelength emission peaks. Furthermore, acetone detection could be achieved in both aqueous and organic phases.







Abstract
The study on structure&#8208;property relationship has been a significant focus in the field of organic molecular luminescence. In the present work, three chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene (HTPE) derivatives were prepared through condensation reactions. Despite their similar structures, these compounds exhibited distinct luminescent properties. Diphenylmethane&#8208;derived HTPE displayed dual&#8208;state emissions, characterized by dual&#8208;wavelength emissions which were insensitive to the polarity of solvents. The dual emissions in solution state could be attributed to the different locally excited (LE) excitons. However, upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, probably leading to different emission peaks.

     alt="Conformer aggregates exhibit dual wavelength emissions on chiral binaphthyl-based triphenylethylenes and acetone detection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral binaphthyl-based triphenylethylene derivatives were synthesized, characterized by the distorted structures with local conjugation-induced rigidity, thus allowing excellent dual state emission. Upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, likely resulting in the dual wavelength emission peaks. Furthermore, acetone detection could be achieved in both aqueous and organic phases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study on structure-property relationship has been a significant focus in the field of organic molecular luminescence. In the present work, three chiral binaphthyl-based triphenylethylene (HTPE) derivatives were prepared through condensation reactions. Despite their similar structures, these compounds exhibited distinct luminescent properties. Diphenylmethane-derived HTPE displayed dual-state emissions, characterized by dual-wavelength emissions which were insensitive to the polarity of solvents. The dual emissions in solution state could be attributed to the different locally excited (LE) excitons. However, upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, probably leading to different emission peaks. In contrast, dibenzocycloheptadiene-derived HTPE aggregates showed only a single emission peak. Surprisingly, fluorene-derived HTPE exhibited obvious luminescence in neither solution nor aggregate states due to inherent &#960;-&#960; interactions. These conclusions were substantiated by X-ray analysis, spectroscopic analysis, and theory calculations. Application studies demonstrated that fluorescence on/off switches could be achieved through exposure to acetone. More importantly, trace amounts of acetone could be detected using luminescent materials in both organic and aqueous phases with a detection limit of 0.08&#8201;%. Thus, this work not only presents a strategy for designing chiral triphenylethylene fluorophores but also provides valuable information for dual wavelength emissions resulting from two stable conformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbonylation as a Key Step in New Tandem Reactions &#8211; A Route to BODIPYs</title>

Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence for BODIPYs is presented. The synthesis of 55 derivatives with overall yields of up to 78&#8201;% showed that we were able to expand the range of readily accessible BODIPYs while demonstrating the general applicability and advantages of our developed method.







Abstract
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to BODIPYs is presented. The key step is the combination of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of aldehydes and their subsequent organocatalytic activation to yield dipyrromethanes, which are further converted to the corresponding BODIPY. Classic syntheses towards BODIPYs have relied on aldehydes or acid chlorides, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive to handle. The presented approach starts from readily available and stable alkenes or aryl&#8208;bromides, which allows to extend the range of readily available BODIPYs that can be tailored for their specific use. The synthesis of 55 derivatives with overall yields of up to 78&#8201;% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the presented method.

Neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si bond was synthesized via dehydrogenation from a silylene complex with (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety. Its monomeric structure was revealed by XRD and DFT calculations. Irradiation of the chromium complex with H2 using LED light let to H2 activation to reproduce the (H)Cr=Si(H) complex. The chromium complex performed benzene C&#8722;H bond activation across the Cr&#8801;Si bond to afford 1,2&#8208;C&#8722;H addition product under irradiation.







Abstract
A neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si triple bond was prepared by dehydrogenation of a chromium silylene complex with Cr&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds, and was isolated as monomeric crystals, unlike dimeric forms of its tungsten and molybdenum congeners. The strong Cr(&#948;&#8722;)&#8722;Si(&#948;+) bond polarity was revealed by the reaction with MeOH and DFT calculations. The chromium silylyne complex reacted with H2 under LED (365&#8197;nm) irradiation to reproduce the precursor silylene complex with a (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety, as a result of 1,2&#8208;H&#8722;H addition across the Cr&#8801;Si triple bond. Similarly, the chromium silylyne complex reacted with benzene under irradiation to afford an 1,2&#8208;addition product with a (H)Cr=Si(Ph) moiety, via benzene C&#8722;H bond activation accompanied by Si&#8722;C bond forming.

         <title>Controlling pH&#8208;Sensitive Chemical Reactions Pathways with Light &#8208; a Tale of Two Photobases: an Arrhenius and a Br&#248;nsted</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interplay between two photobases, a hydroxide&#8208;releasing Arrhenius&#8208;type and a proton&#8208;accepting Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type, can result in a reversible change of pH upon tandem irradiation at two wavelengths. This system can control the direction of chemical reactions. In this study, the reaction direction of Alizarin Red S can be controlled in this manner.







Abstract
Light&#8208;gated chemical reactions allow spatial and temporal control of chemical processes. Here, we suggest a new system for controlling pH&#8208;sensitive processes with light using two photobases of Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted types. Only after light excitation do Arrhenius photobases undergo hydroxide ion dissociation, while Br&#248;nsted photobases capture a proton. However, none can be used alone to reversibly control pH due to the limitations arising from excessively fast or overly slow photoreaction timescales. We show here that combining the two types of photobases allows light&#8208;triggered and reversible pH control. We show an application of this method in directing the pH&#8208;dependent reaction pathways of the organic dye Alizarin Red S simply by switching between different wavelengths of light, i.&#8201;e., irradiating each photobase separately. The concept of a light&#8208;controlled system shown here of a sophisticated interplay between two photobases can be integrated into various smart functional and dynamic systems.

The reaction of isocyanates and oximes undergoes N&#8208;selective carbamoylation, directly generating nitrones. Sequential reactions with dipolarophiles give isoxazolidines. The combination of the three components provides diversity in the yields of isoxazolidines.







Abstract
N&#8208;Selective carbamoylation reaction of oximes with isocyanates generates nitrones, which undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles to afford diverse isoxazolidines. Notably, combinations of highly electron&#8208;rich oxime and highly electron&#8208;deficient dipolarophile exhibited high reactivity, with product yields of up to 94&#8201;%. The substituent on the isoxazolidine&#8208;nitrogen atom could be successfully removed without loss of the cyclic structure. Computational studies have also elucidated the mechanism of the reaction and origin of stereoselectivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes by using an &#8220;ambident anthracene&#8221; building block is presented. For this purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is currently the iptycene with the longest chain to have been synthesized. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303687).

The depicted stainless steel autoclave is the heart of the presented methodology. It allows the performance of the method's key steps, which are the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of aldehydes and their subsequent organocatalytic activation. The resulting dipyrromethanes are directly converted to highly fluorescent meso&#8208;alkyl and &#8208;aryl BODIPYs in yields of up to 78&#8201;% over five consecutive steps from stable and readily available alkenes or aryl bromides. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Breit and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303752).

The summarization of the progress in the design strategy of OER electrocatalysts is beneficial to building the future global energy mix. The strategy of combining theoretical design and experimental verification can shed light on the design, preparation, and application of advanced OER catalysts.







Abstract
Scientists are increasingly paying attention to using theoretical design as a guide combined with modern in&#8208;situ characterization techniques to develop catalysts with high activity, low cost, and long&#8208;term life. The review discusses the progress of catalyst theoretical design and corresponding experiments based on three typical oxygen evolution catalytic mechanisms, including the adsorbate evolution, lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated, and unconventional bifunctional mechanisms. This work briefly describes the commonly used tools and descriptors in theory as well as the electrochemical techniques and characterizations in experiments. Our purpose is to sort out the ways to closely integrate the theoretical method and experimental verification from the perspective of reaction mechanism, and to provide some experience reference for the future development of theoretical tools and experimental technologies.

         <title>Contemporary Applications of Thioamides and Methods for Their Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 9, February 12, 2024. </description>

Substitution of amide bonds with thioamides can have a beneficial influence on the stability of peptides towards proteolysis and affect folding among other effects. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for modification of peptides and natural products as well as new frontiers in the introduction of thioamide functionalities into proteins.







Abstract
Thioamides are naturally occurring isosteres of amide bonds in which the chalcogen atom of the carbonyl is changed from oxygen to sulfur. This substitution gives rise to altered nucleophilicity and hydrogen bonding properties with importance for both chemical reactivity and non&#8208;covalent interactions. As such, thioamides have been introduced into biologically active compounds to achieve improved target affinity and/or stability towards hydrolytic enzymes but have also been applied as probes of protein and peptide folding and dynamics. Recently, a series of new methods have been developed for the synthesis of thioamides as well as their utilization in peptide chemistry. Further, novel strategies for the incorporation of thioamides into proteins have been developed, enabling both structural and functional studies to be performed. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for peptide modification and study of protein function.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Late&#8208;Stage Chemoselective Photocatalytic Removal of Sulfonyl and Phenacyl Groups in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, BPC catalyzed visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered target&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan in oligopeptides is portrayed by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. This robust and mild method is highly predictable and chemoselective, tolerating myriad of functional groups in aza&#8208;heteroaromatics and peptides. Interestingly, reductive desulfonylation is also amenable to biologically significant reactive histidine and tyrosine side chains, signifying the versatility of the strategy. Additional efficacy of BPC is demonstrated by solution phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. Furthermore, excellent catalyst loading of 0.5 mol% and recyclability demonstrate the practical utility and applicability of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>TiO2/Loofah&#8208;Halloysite Bio&#8208;Hybrid Composites as Efficient Systems for VOCs Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), recognized as hazardous air contaminants, prompt the exploration of sustainable air purification methods. Solar photocatalytic oxidation emerges as a promising solution, utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts like titanium dioxide (TiO2). However, the raw material crisis necessitates reduced TiO2 usage, leading to investigations into TiO2 modification techniques. The study introduces a novel approach by employing natural fibers, specifically loofah sponge, as a TiO2 support. This method aims to maintain photocatalytic activity while minimizing TiO2 content. The article explores using halloysite, a natural clay mineral, as a supportive material, enhancing mechanical strength and adsorption properties. The resulting TiO2/loofah&#8208;halloysite composites are evaluated for their efficacy in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and ethanol, chosen as representative VOCs. The conversion of toluene and ethanol on the composite was 88% and 39%, respectively, with high selectivity toward CO2. In addition to its high performance, the bio&#8208;composite was stable for several conversion cycles, keeping the conversion activity unchanged. The study contributes to developing green hybrid materials for VOC removal, showcasing potential applications across industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to a peri&#8208;Annulated Aluminium Compound via C&#8211;H Bond Activation by a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Aluminylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbocyclic aluminium halides [(ADC)AlX2]2 (2&#8208;X) (X = F, Cl, and I) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC = PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) framework are prepared as crystalline solids by dehydrohalogenations of the alane [(ADC)AlH2]2 (1). KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I affords the peri&#8208;annulated Al(III) compound [(ADCH)AlH]2 &#160;(4) (ADCH = PhC{N(Dipp)C2(DippH)N}, DippH = 2&#8208;iPr,6&#8208;(Me2C)C6H3)) as a colorless crystalline solid in 76% yield. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene species [(ADC)Al]2 (3) into the methine C&#8211;H bond of HCMe2 group. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3, while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61 kcal/mol. Compounds 2&#8208;F, 2&#8208;Cl, 2&#8208;I, and 4 have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their solid&#8208;state molecular structures have been established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction of the Immune System TIM&#8208;3 Protein with a Model Cellular Membrane Containing Phosphatidyl&#8208;Serine Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T cell transmembrane, Immunoglobulin, and Mucin (TIM) are important immune system proteins which are especially present in T&#8208;cells and regulated the immune system by sensing cell engulfment and apoptotic processes. Their role is exerted by the capacity to detect the presence of phosphatidyl&#8208;serine lipid polar head in the outer leaflet of cellular membranes (correlated with apoptosis). In this contribution by using equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation we unravel the molecular bases and the thermodynamics of TIM, and in particular TIM&#8208;3, interaction with phosphatidyl serine in a lipid bilayer. Since TIM&#8208;3 deregulation is an important factor of pro&#8208;oncogenic tumor micro&#8208;environment understanding its functioning at a molecular level may pave the way to the development of original immunotherapeutic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by pillararene</title>

         <dc:description>Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene via host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self&#8208;assembled aggregates of the bola&#8208;type amphiphile G can be tailored by adding different amounts of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5). In addition, the emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G and WP5 are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of G and the regulation by WP5 or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Bidentate Phosphines Enabled by Photoinduced Reductive Diphosphination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diphosphination of alkenes through a radical pathway offers a promising approach for the rapid construction of aryl bisphosphines. However, such a synthetic strategy has not been successfully applied to the preparation of alkyl bisphosphines, partially due to the difficulties in the generation of phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals from common alkyl phosphine compounds. We herein demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by hiring Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine as the phosphine source that can act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals. With this novel strategy, a photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination reaction has been established, allowing for a straightforward synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of&#160;Alkyl Alkenesulfonates using Styrenes, SO2 and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel electrochemical approach to access alkyl alkenesulfonates via a multicomponent reaction was developed. The metal&#8208;free method features easy&#8208;to&#8208;use SO2 stock solution forming monoalkylsulfites from alcohols with an auxiliary base in&#8208;situ. These intermediates serve a dual role as starting materials and as supporting electrolyte enabling conductivity. Anodic oxidation of the substrate styrene, radical addition of these monoalkylsulfites and consecutive second oxidation and deprotonation preserve the double bond and form alkyl &#946;&#8208;styrenesulfonates in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. The feasibility of this electrosynthetic method is demonstrated in 44 examples with yields up to 81%, employing various styrenes and related substrates as well as a diverse set of alcohols. A gram&#8208;scale experiment underlines the applicability of this process, which uses inexpensive and readily available electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electropolymerization of Preferred&#8208;Oriented Conjugated Microporous Polymer Films for Enhanced Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP&#8208;based thin films for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of B&#8592;N Adducts by the Amine&#8208;Facilitated Trimerization of the Phenylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable boroxine&#8208;amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically&#8208;induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1H&#8208;pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). In&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, ex&#8208;situ PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3:1, 3:2 or 6:1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1:2 H&#8208;bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3:1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Induced Oligomerization of Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Phenylazothiazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometry of the molecules plays important role in various chemical and physical properties. Photoswitches are molecules that undergo structural changes from a stable isomer (trans) to a geometrically different less stable structure (cis) by light irradiation through isomerization. Here an unconventional phenomenon is reported where a cis isomer undergo oligomerization in the absence of light, however, behave as typical photoswitches in the presence of light irradiation.







Abstract
Photoswitches are molecules that can absorb light of specific wavelengths and undergo a reversible transformation between their trans and cis isomeric forms. In phenylazo photoswitches, it is common for the less stable cis (Z) isomer to convert back to the more stable trans (E) isomer either through photochemical or thermal means. In this research, we designed new derivatives of phenylazothiazole (PAT) photoswitches, PAT&#8208;Fn, which feature fluorine substituents on their phenyl component. These derivatives can reversibly isomerize under visible light exposure with the enrichment of E and Z isomers at photostationary state (PSS). Surprisingly, we observed an unconventional phenomenon when these PAT&#8208;Fn (n&#8807;2) photoswitches were in their cis isomeric state in the absence of light. Instead of the anticipated transformation from cis to trans isomer, these compounds converted to an oligomeric compound. Our detailed experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, indicated the crucial role of fluorine substituents and the distinctive geometric arrangement of the cis isomer in driving the unexpected oligomerization process originating from the cis isomeric state.

         <title>Osme Bond: Geometric and Energetic Features in the Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adducts formed by OsO4 and Lewis bases, have already been rationalised as &#963;&#8208;hole based adducts. The interaction involving Osmium as electrophilic site is named Osme Bond (Omb). Here, new adducts with OmB interaction were characterized. Computations confirm a strong correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and geometric deformation of OsO4.







Abstract
Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis bases exert a role in important oxidation processes such as epoxidation and dihydroxylation. It has been shown that the attractive interaction driving the formation of these adducts is a &#963;&#8208;hole bond involving the metal as the electrophilic species; the term Osme Bond (OmB) was proposed for designating it. Here some new adducts between OsO4 and various bases have been characterized through single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational studies (density functional theory, DFT), confirming the existence of a robust correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and deformation of the tetrahedral geometry of OsO4. Also, some adducts formed by RuO4 with nucleophiles were investigated computationally.

         <title>Switchable Redox and Thermo&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Based on Cyclodextrin&#8208;Polyoxometalate Tandem</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaotropic behavior of polyoxometalates is exploited as an operating principle to promote a reversible and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polymer where supramolecular networking results from the host&#8208;guest interactions between cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. This study reveals that the chaotropic effect corresponds to an effective force able to induce responsiveness into supramolecular materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers built from stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest interactions represent an attractive way of tailoring smart materials. Herein, we exploit the chaotropic effect of polyoxometalates and related host&#8208;guest properties to design unconventional polymer systems with reversible redox and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition. These supramolecular networks result from the association of cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. The structure and the dynamics of such self&#8208;assembly systems have been investigated using a multiscale approach involving MALDI&#8208;TOF, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry, 1H&#8208;NMR (1D and DOSY), and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering. Our results reveal that the chaotropic effect corresponds to a powerful and efficient force that can be used to induce responsiveness in hybrid supramolecular oligomeric systems.

         <title>Mimicking the Shape and Function of the ClC Chloride Channel Selective Pore by Combining a Molecular Hourglass Shape with Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of combining molecular hourglass with anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for mimicking the shape and function of the ClC chloride channel selective pore is presented. High and regulatable chloride transport conductance and selectivity that replicate the properties demonstrated by ClC is achieved through modifying the constituent components of the molecular hourglass.







Abstract
ClC is the main family of natural chloride channel proteins that transport Cl&#8722; across the cell membrane with high selectivity. The chloride transport and selectivity are determined by the hourglass&#8208;shaped pore and the filter located in the central and narrow region of the pore. Artificial unimolecular channel that mimics both the shape and function of the ClC selective pore is attractive, because it could provide simple molecular model to probe the intriguing mechanism and structure&#8208;function relevance of ClC. Here we elaborated upon the concept of molecular hourglass plus anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for this purpose. The concept was validated by experimental results of molecular hourglasses using shape&#8208;persistent 1,3&#8208;alternate tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine as the central macrocyclic skeleton to control the conductance and selectivity, and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions as the driving force to facilitate the chloride dehydration and movement along the channel.

     alt="Mimicking the Shape and Function of the ClC Chloride Channel Selective Pore by Combining a Molecular Hourglass Shape with Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of combining molecular hourglass with anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for mimicking the shape and function of the ClC chloride channel selective pore is presented. High and regulatable chloride transport conductance and selectivity that replicate the properties demonstrated by ClC is achieved through modifying the constituent components of the molecular hourglass.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ClC is the main family of natural chloride channel proteins that transport Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; across the cell membrane with high selectivity. The chloride transport and selectivity are determined by the hourglass-shaped pore and the filter located in the central and narrow region of the pore. Artificial unimolecular channel that mimics both the shape and function of the ClC selective pore is attractive, because it could provide simple molecular model to probe the intriguing mechanism and structure-function relevance of ClC. Here we elaborated upon the concept of molecular hourglass plus anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for this purpose. The concept was validated by experimental results of molecular hourglasses using shape-persistent 1,3-alternate tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine as the central macrocyclic skeleton to control the conductance and selectivity, and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions as the driving force to facilitate the chloride dehydration and movement along the channel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selectively transport and removal of fluoride ion by pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride contamination of groundwater has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Currently, excessive absorption of fluoride can be toxic to humans and crops. To address the challenge, we explored the excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer framework. By constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, the pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane achieves a fluoride removal.







Abstract
Excess fluoride ions in groundwater accumulate through the roots of crops, affecting photosynthesis and inhibiting their growth. Long&#8208;term bioaccumulation also threatens human health because it is poorly degradable and toxic. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is developing a unique material that can efficiently remove fluoride ions from the environment. The excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membranes were explored to address this challenge. Constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, consisting of microscale etched nanochannels and nanoscale pillar[5]arene cross&#8208;linked polymer voids. A fluoride removal rate of 0.0088&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 was achieved. Notably, this rate surpassed the rates observed with other control ions by a factor of 6 to 8.8. Our research provides a new direction for developing water fluoride ion removal materials.

         <title>Synthesis and photophysical characterization of a pH&#8208;sensitive quadracyclic uridine (qU) analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the synthesis and detailed photophysical characterization of qU &#8211; a novel fluorescent base analogue of uridine. qU exhibits interesting properties such as excitation in the visible region with high brightness, dual emission, pH sensitivity, and an ESPT reaction. This work has extended the toolbox of internal RNA labels for future applications such as fluorescence lifetime imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) have become useful tools for applications in biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, live&#8208;cell imaging, and RNA therapeutics. Herein, two synthetic routes towards a novel FBA of uracil named qU (quadracyclic uracil/uridine) are described. The qU nucleobase bears a tetracyclic fused ring system and is designed to allow for specific Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing with adenine. We find that qU absorbs light in the visible region of the spectrum and emits brightly with a quantum yield of 27&#8201;% and a dual&#8208;band character in a wide pH range. With evidence, among other things, from fluorescence lifetime measurements we suggest that this dual emission feature results from an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Furthermore, we find that both absorption and emission of qU are highly sensitive to pH. The high brightness in combination with excitation in the visible and pH responsiveness makes qU an interesting native&#8208;like nucleic acid label in spectroscopy and microscopy applications in, for example, the field of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics.

         <title>Electroplated electrodes for continuous and mass&#8208;efficient electrochemical hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (ECH) receive growing attention due to their sustainable potential. Our innovative one&#8208;step protocol creates carbon&#8208;supported silver electrodes, finely tunable for morphology and catalytic activity. Achieving 93&#8201;% current efficiency in ECH for the vitamin synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, even at higher current densities and reduced metal loadings, we successfully converted a library of 17&#8197;diverse substrates. More information can be found in the Research Article by U.&#8208;P. Apfel, D. Siegmund and co&#8208;workers (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202303808).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenations (ECH) enable the reduction of organic substrates upon usage of electric current and present a sustainable alternative to conventional processes if green electricity is used. Opposed to most current protocols for electrode preparation, this work presents a one&#8208;step binder&#8208; and additive&#8208;free production of silver&#8208; and copper&#8208;electroplated electrodes. Controlled adjustment of the preparation parameters allows for the tuning of catalyst morphology and its electrochemical properties. Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93&#8201;% for the ECH of the Vitamin&#8197;A&#8208; and E&#8208;synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single&#8208;pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17&#8197;different C&#8722;C&#8722;, C&#8722;O&#8722; and N&#8722;O&#8722;unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process. Our results lay an important groundwork for the development of electrochemical reactors and electrodes able to directly compete with the palladium&#8208;based thermocatalytic state of the art.

         <title>Photochemical Action Plots Reveal Red&#8208;shifted Wavelength&#8208;dependent Photoproduct Distributions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical action plots are used to deconvolute the wavelength&#8208;selective photoreactivity of a single chromophore. Remarkably, by irradiating with different monochromatic wavelengths of light, either the trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;isomerization or the [2+2]&#8208;photocyclisation can be selectively triggered.







Abstract
Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for mapping photochemical reaction outcomes wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength. Typically, they map either the depletion of a reactant or the formation of a specific product as a function of wavelength. Herein, we exploit action plots to simultaneously map the formation of several photochemical products from a single chromophore. We demonstrate that the wavelength&#8208;resolved mapping of two reaction products formed during the irradiation of a chalcone species not only shows wavelength dependence &#8211; exhibiting the typical strong red&#8208;shift of the photochemical reactivity compared to the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore &#8211; but also a strong wavelength selectivity with remarkably different product distributions resulting from different irradiation wavelengths.

         <title>A Nanoplatform Based on Pillar[5]arene Nanovalves for Combined Drug Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene acts like an intelligent robot to efficiently regulate drug loading and release. Nanogold is widely used and shows advantages in oncology treatment; however, it cannot encapsulate drugs directly and effectively like other nanovesicles or nanocages. The modified pillar[5]arenecan endowed nanogold with excellent drug&#8208;loading ability through a simple host&#8211;guest interaction, and successfully achieved the combination of DOX and GOX for cancer therapy. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400007).

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols has been realized in an acylation reaction catalyzed by a supramolecular catalyst consisting of an enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsule and an achiral guest possessing a catalytic center. The enantioselective acylation proceeds at the exterior of a supramolecular catalyst. The cover picture represents the catalytic center of the supramolecular catalyst that accelerates the acylation of either enantiomer, resulting in the successful kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols.

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Manipulation of Well&#8208;Defined Trinuclear Pd(II)&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several strategies abound to design well&#8208;defined multimetallic molecular entities bearing functional ligands. Substoichiometric exchange reactions in the coordination sphere of pre&#8208;existing multinuclear precursors is relatively underexploited in this context. Palladium(II) acetate is not a mononuclear compound in the solid state but rather exists as a trimer, i.e. [Pd3(OAc)6]. Although this material is ubiquitously used to synthesize mononuclear Pd species, it may principally also lend itself to selective exchange of some of the edge&#8208;sharing acetate units in its triangular motif, whilst keeping the overall multinuclear architecture intact. Strikingly, little is known about the controlled manipulation and substoichiometric substitution chemistry of this well&#8208;defined conglomerate. We herein conclusively demonstrate that, for the first time, the targeted exchange of two or four acetate units from the Pd3(acetate)6 platform is possible, thereby installing either one or two new tridentate ligands onto this trinuclear architecture. &#160;Follow&#8208;up exchange and substitution chemistry is available without disrupting the multimetallic nature of the core structure. New complexes 2&#8208;7 are all conclusively characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Temperature&#8208;Tolerant Magnesium&#8208;Ion Battery Using Ball Cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as High&#8208;Performance Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a ball cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as cathode for rechargable magnesium&#8208;ion batteries, which displays a good electrochemical performance. After cycling 300 times, the capacity and Coulombic efficiency keep stable, which are ascribed to ball cactus&#8208;like morphology buffers the volumetric change during Mg2+ insertion/extraction, and provides sufficient pathways for ion diffusion.







Abstract
Safe and high&#8208;performance secondary batteries using for all&#8208;climate conditions with different temperatures are highly required. Here, we develop a three&#8208;dimensional ball cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as cathode material for magnesium&#8208;ion (Mg&#8208;ion) batteries. After cycling 300 times, the capacity maintains 111.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, while Coulombic efficiency stabilizes at about 100&#8201;%. Under temperatures of 45&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C, the capacities remain stable after 200 cycles. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance tests, the capacity keeps quite stable. It is ascribed to the ball cactus&#8208;like morphology buffers the volumetric change during Mg2+ insertion/extraction, and provides sufficient pathways for ion diffusion, which has been verified by constant&#8208;current intermittent titration technology. It is believed that the good performance enables the Mg&#8208;ion batteries to have a all&#8208;climate capability.

         <title>Straightforward Access to Free &#946;2,3,3&#8208;Amino Acids through One Pot C&#8208;H Activation/C&#8722;C Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H activation/C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of novel spirocyclic &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids, is reported. This approach shows wide substrate scope of CF3&#8208;ynones and ketimines. In addition, several natural products and biologically relevant molecules, prepared by this method, can be further functionalized. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures can be successfully assembled with this spirocyclic amino acid.







Abstract
The first synthesis of unnatural &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with a spirocyclic backbone by one&#8208;pot protocol has been presented. This reaction features wide functional group tolerance and feasibility of post&#8208;functionalization of natural products and biologically important molecules. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures were assembled using this newly developed &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acid in high efficiency. The combination of C&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids would trigger more promising synthetic routes for this compound.

Electrode/electrolyte interface built by the dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB enables significant improvement on the cycling stability of hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell.







Abstract
Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de&#8208;solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3&#8197;M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic&#8208;dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17&#8201;% (baseline) to 79&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB) and 83&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB and 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on &#955;5Phosphinine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are known as a promising class of blue fluorescent emitters, those photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values have been reached up to 92%, however, only a few examples have been explored as an emitter for blue organic light&#8208;emitting device (OLED), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) has been below 2.4% so far. In this study, we newly developed two types of blue &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives namely CN&#8208;COCF3 and CO2Me&#8208;CHO, and investigated the photophysical properties in the solid states. The photophysical analyses in solid state films suggested that the strong electron&#8208;accepting nature of these &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives caused the inferior PLQY values, and the exciplex formation with the host and neighboring materials should be avoided to improve the device efficiency. By choosing suitable host and neighboring materials with deep ionization potentials, we successfully realized efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs with EQE of over 4% and CIE (0.14, 0.18). This is among the best in &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;based blue OLEDs so far.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Twostep Chemobiocatalytic Synthesis of a Furan Amino Acid from 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, catalytic valorization of biomass&#8208;derived furans has received growing interest. 5&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC), a furan amino acid, holds great promise in the aeras of polymer and pharmaceutical, but its synthesis remains limited. In this work, we report a chemobiocatalytic route toward AMFC by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and recombinant Escherichia coli (named E. coli_TAF) harboring &#969;&#8208;transaminase (TA), L&#8208;alanine dehydrogenase (L&#8208;AlaDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In the cascade, HMF is oxidized into 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) by laccase&#8208;TEMPO system, and then the resulting intermediate was converted into AMFC by E. coli_TAF via transamination with cheap ammonium formate instead of costly organic amine donors, theoretically generating H2O and CO2 as by&#8208;products. The tandem process was run in a one&#8208;pot twostep manner, affording AMFC with approximately 81% yield, together with 10% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as by&#8208;product. In addition, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41 g/L h productivity and 8.6 g/L titer. This work may pave the way for green manufacturing of the furan&#8208;containing amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Halogen Dance Reactions of Bromoarenes Enabled by Catalytic Potassium Hexamethyldisilazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base, a stoichiometric combination of nBuLi and KOtBu, is commonly used as a superbase for deprotonating a wide range of organic compounds. In the present study, we report that catalytic potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu for successive bromine&#8211;metal exchanges. Accordingly, 1&#8211;10 mol% of KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen dance reactions to introduce various electrophiles to bromopyridine, bromoimidazole, bromothiophene, bromofuran, and bromobenzene derivatives with the bromo group translocated from the original position. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed to explain the ultrafast bromine transfer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this work, we analyzed trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) regarding their potential use as dielectrics by investigating some of their intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Both compounds show a higher breakdown voltage than SF6 with averaged relative breakdown voltages of 1.3 &#177;0.2 for CF3OSO2F and 1.4 &#177;0.2 for CF3OSF5 compared to SF6 with 1.0. Like the dielectric (CF3)2CFCN, both compounds decompose during the breakdown process. The decomposition products were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and GCIR methods. Furthermore, the molecular structures of both gaseous compounds CF3OSO2F and CF3OSF5 have been determined by in situ crystallization, and their physical properties were determined as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Dinitrogen Trioxidefor Organic Synthesis: A Phase Equilibrium Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent and atom economic nitrosating agent. The preparation of N2O3 is difficult due to its instability and entangled chemical and phase equilibria. This review reexamines the preparative methods of pure N2O3 and its concentrated (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) solutions via a phase equilibrium approach in combination with worked examples in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent nitrosating agent featured with high reactivity and appealing atom economy. Because of its instability and the entanglement of chemical and phase equilibria, N2O3 has rarely been utilized in organic synthesis as a stock reagent with well&#8208;defined composition. In this review,the preparations of pure N2O3 and its concentrated solution (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) are discussed from the aspect of phase equilibrium. Understanding the physical and chemical characteristics of N2O3, along with how reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, molar ratio) interact, plays a crucial role in managing the concentration of N2O3 in the liquid phase. This control holds practical significance in achieving quantitative reactions.

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel=Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New family of direct band gap semiconductors. The new compound Na3In2P3 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.27&#8197;eV and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional polyanionic framework of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. Additionally, the related phosphidotrielates Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2 and Na3InP2, which are all built up by triel phosphorus tetrahedra as well, have been proven to be semiconductors as well, with direct band gaps ranging from of 1.37&#8197;eV to 2.45&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45&#8197;eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#8197;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99&#8197;eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#8197;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#8197;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E=In and vertices as well as edges for E=Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.

         <title>Towards Amplified Probing of Weak Intermolecular Interactions on the External Surfaces of Molecular Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive equilibria between homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsular complexes reveal unexpected variations in the aryl&#8208;aryl interactions of eight benzoyl fragments grouped in four tight pairs on the outer surfaces of the capsules.







Abstract
We report a sensitive method for comparing weak interactions between aryl rings located on the external surfaces of equilibrating homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsules. Two identical self&#8208;complementary resorcin[4]arene tetrabenzoate molecules and one tetramethylammonium cation form in CDCl3 hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimeric capsules whose exteriors are decorated with four tight pairs of weakly interacting aryl rings. The pair wise mixing of six different homodimers establishes their equilibria with the corresponding heterodimeric species in which two types of aryl rings exert on each other some gentle forces. This equilibrium is significantly shifted either towards homo&#8208; or heterodimers depending on the nature and location of the substituents in the weakly interacting aryl rings. The thermodynamic favorability or disadvantage of the heterodimerization is determined by stronger or weaker aryl&#8208;aryl attractions in the hetero&#8208; or homodimeric capsules, respectively. The four&#8208;fold amplification of weak aryl&#8208;aryl interactions on the external surfaces of the equilibrating capsules is responsible for high sensitiveness of our approach.

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;controlled pH variations enabled by the decarboxylation of nitroacetic acid are transduced into time&#8208;controlled voltage variations. Such variations are exploited to govern the operation of simple electric devices.







Abstract
The use of Activated Carboxylic Acids (ACAs) allows the time&#8208;controlled operation of dissipative chemical systems based on the acid&#8208;base reaction by providing both the stimulus that temporarily drives a physicochemical change and, subsequently, the counter&#8208;stimulus with a single reagent addition. However, their application is inherently limited to acid&#8208;sensitive systems. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop a straightforward device for the transduction of the acid&#8208;base stimuli delivered by an ACA into a voltage signal that, in turn, is used to control voltage&#8208;sensitive circuits that are not pH&#8208;responsive by themselves. The signal transductor can be easily assembled from common laboratory equipment and employs aqueous solutions of readily available chemicals. Furthermore, the operator can simply and intuitively tune the amplitude of the voltage signal, as well as its duration and offset by varying the concentration of the chemical species involved in the transduction process.

         <title>Synthesis and Identification of decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins in Toxic Microalgae and their Reactions with the Oxygenase, SxtT, Reveal Saxitoxin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins (doSTXs), dd&#8208;doSTX (2), 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (4) and doSTX (5) were synthesized, and 2, 3, and 5 were identified in the toxin&#8208;producing marine dinoflagellates and a freshwater cyanobacterium. In addition, conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 by SxtT with VanB was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a biosynthetic precursor of STX (1), and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylation proceed after cyclization in STX biosynthesis.







Abstract
Saxitoxin (STX, 1) is a representative compound of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that are produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Although several pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of STX, the order of ring and side chain hydroxylation, and formation of the tricyclic skeleton have not been well established. In this study, 12,12&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;decarbamoyloxySTX (dd&#8208;doSTX, 2), the most reduced STX analogue having the tricyclic skeleton, and its analogues, 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 4), and doSTX (5), were synthesized, and these compounds were screened in the toxic microalgae using high&#8208;resolution LCMSMS. dd&#8208;doSTX (2) and 12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX (3) were identified in the PSTs&#8208;producing dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella, A. pacificum, and/or Gymnodinium catenatum) and in the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum circinale (TA04). doSTX (5), previously isolated from the dinoflagellate G. catenatum, was also identified in D. circinale (TA04). Furthermore, the conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5, by SxtT with VanB, a reported Rieske oxygenase and its redox partner in STX biosynthesis, was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a possible biosynthetic precursor of STX, and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylations proceed after cyclization.

         <title>Sterically Congested Protecting Group for a Boronyl Group in Iterative Aminations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide and aryl boronic acid produces aryl&#8208;oxazaborolidinone (Ar&#8208;OxB). In Ar&#8208;OxB, the &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide&#8208;moiety was found to be a good protecting group for the boronyl group. This Ar&#8208;OxB is effective for Iterative aminations including Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam couplings.







Abstract
In this study, we found that the sterically bulky &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety is a suitable framework for protecting the boronyl group of boron reagents during aminations. Condensation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide with ArB(OH)2 produced aryloxazaborolidinone (ArOxB). The reactivity of the C&#8208;B bond in ArOxB is easily controlled by the steric and weak electronic effects of the backbone. H2N&#8208;(or Br&#8722;)ArOxB underwent Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam (C&#8208;E&#8208;L) or Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig (B&#8208;H) amination with retaining the C&#8722;B bond. On the other hand, direct C&#8208;E&#8208;L amination of ArOxB was also possible in an oxidative atmosphere, in which the C&#8722;B bond was activated by CuII species. Our methodology is effective for the precise synthesis of two or more arylamino group substituted arenes.

         <title>Targeting the Antifungal Activity of Carbon Dots against Candida albicans Biofilm Formation by Tailoring Their Surface Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three classes of Carbon Dots with different composition and charged surfaces were prepared and completely characterised with regards to their morphology and physicochemical properties. We demonstrate the requirement of a positively&#8208;charged surface to exert antibiofilm formation by C. albicans paired with anti&#8208;adhesion and internalization properties, and with a mortality reduction of infected larvae in in&#8197;vivo tests.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging class of carbon nanoparticles, which for their characteristics have found applications in many fields such as catalysis, materials and biomedicine. Within this context, the application of CDs as antibacterial agents has received much attention in very recent years, while their use as antifungal nanoparticles has been scarcely investigated. Here we report a systematic investigation of the surface functional groups of CDs to study their influence on these nanoparticles&#8217; against Candida albicans. Three classes of CDs have been synthesised and fully characterized. A thorough in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo biological screening against C. albicans was performed to test their antifungal, antiadhesion and antibiofilm formation activities. Moreover, the interaction with C. albicans cells was investigated by microscopic analysis. Our results evidence how the presence of a positively polarised surface results crucial for the internalization into COS&#8208;7 cells. Positively charged nanoparticles were also able to inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation, to interact with the cellular membrane of C. albicans, and to increase the survival of G. mellonella infected larvae after the injection with positive nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of CDs and their extremely low toxicity may represent a new strategy to combat infections sustained by C.albicans.

         <title>Computational study into the oxidative ring&#8208;closure mechanism during the biosynthesis of deoxypodophyllotoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron dioxygenase deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase performs an oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction as part of natural product synthesis in plants. How the enzyme enables the oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction of (&#8208;)&#8208;yatein and avoids substrate hydroxylation remains unknown. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism and understand the details of the pathways leading to products and byproducts we performed a comprehensive computational study. The work shows that substrate is bound tightly into the substrate binding pocket with the C7&#8217;&#8722;H bond closest to the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species. The reaction proceeds with hydrogen atom abstraction from the C7&#8217;&#8722;H position followed by ring&#8208;closure and a final hydrogen transfer to form iron(II)&#8208;water and deoxypodophyllotoxin. Alternative mechanisms including substrate hydroxylation and an electron transfer pathway were explored but found to be higher in energy. The mechanism is guided by electrostatic perturbations of charged residues in the second&#8208;coordination sphere that prevent alternative pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dihydrogen Activation by (C5Me5)M/N (M = Rh, Ir) Transition Metal Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Reversible Proton Migration to, and Proton Abstraction from, the C5Me5 Ligand</title>

         <title>Highly Ordered Co&#8208;Assembly of Bisurea Functionalized Molecular Switches at the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the design, synthesis, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of physisorbed monolayers of overcrowded alkene photoswitches physisorbed at the solid&#8208;liquid interface.







Abstract
Immobilization of stimulus&#8208;responsive systems on solid surfaces is beneficial for controlled signal transmission and adaptive behavior while allowing the characterization of the functional interface with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. Positioning of the stimuli&#8208;responsive units with nanometer&#8208;scale precision across the adaptive surface remains one of the bottlenecks in the extraction of cooperative function. Nanoscale organization, cooperativity, and amplification remain key challenges in bridging the molecular and the macroscopic worlds. Here we report on the design, synthesis, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of overcrowded alkene photoswitches merged in self&#8208;assembled networks physisorbed at the solid&#8208;liquid interface. A detailed anchoring strategy that ensures appropriate orientation of the switches with respect to the solid surface through the use of bis&#8208;urea groups is presented. We implement a co&#8208;assembly strategy that enables the merging of the photoswitches within physisorbed monolayers of structurally similar &#8216;spacer&#8217; molecules. The self&#8208;assembly of the individual components and the co&#8208;assemblies was examined in detail using (sub)molecular resolution STM which confirms the robust immobilization and controlled orientation of the photoswitches within the spacer monolayers. The experimental STM data is supported by detailed molecular mechanics (MM) simulations. Different designs of the switches and the spacers were investigated which allowed us to formulate guidelines that enable the precise organization of the photoswitches in crystalline physisorbed self&#8208;assembled molecular networks.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Lactones, Cyclopropanes and ATRA&#450;&#160;Products: Revealing the Role of Sodium Ascorbate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;mediated processes have received significant attention, since they have re&#8208;surfaced unconventional reactivity platforms, complementary to conventional polar chemistry. &#947;&#8208;Lactones and cyclopropanes are prevalent moieties, found in numerous natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods for their synthesis, light&#8208;mediated protocols are coming to the spotlight, although these are contingent upon the use of photoorgano&#8208; or metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we introduce a novel photochemical activation of iodo&#8208;reagents via the use of cheap sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid to enable their homolytic scission and addition onto double bonds. The developed protocol was applied successfully to the formal [3+2] cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, traditional atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions and the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step conversion of alkenes to cyclopropanes. In all cases, the desired products were obtained in good to high yields, while the reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated. Depending on the nature of the iodo&#8208;reagent, a halogen or a hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is formed, which initiates the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran over Ga&#8208;silicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five&#8208;membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed&#8208;bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga&#8208;silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation. This work provides new opportunities&#160;for the continuous valorisation of bio&#8208;feedstock molecules in the perspective of the emerging biorefinery era.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>[1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8211;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Bench&#8208;Stable Iron Precatalyst for Building Arene and Triazine Rings by [2+2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition procedure leading to the construction of (hetero)aromatic rings by alkyne [2+2+2] cycloisomerization. This method relies on the use of an air&#8208;stable (N,N)Fe(II) precursor easily prepared from a commercially available ligand derived from 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, reduced in situ into a catalytically active non&#8208;innocent (N,N&#9679;&#8211;)2Fe(II) species. This system displays a large scope application, operates under mild conditions and at low catalytic charges (25 cycloadducts formed, up to 1.5 mol% catalyst). Moreover, this method also enables access to 29 cycloadducts by cross&#8208;cycloisomerization between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes in near&#8208;equimolar conditions. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines can also be prepared with this procedure starting from the corresponding cyanamides. Scale&#8208;up reactions and post&#8208;functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps ($\Delta E_{ST}$), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to $\Delta E_{ST}$ values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules.&#160; By integrating rigorous computational analysis, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Absorbing Bis&#8208;Donor Functionalized Aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives: Synthesis and Photophysical Study by Using Transient Optical Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (Benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8722;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs = 710 nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs = 685 nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F = 0.2&#8722;0.7% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F = 27% in toluene). However, the apparent intersystem crossing ability of these compounds is poor, based on the singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916; = 0.3&#8722;1.5%). The ns&#8208;TA spectral study showed typical Bodipy localized triplet state transient features, short&#8208;lived excited triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#964;T = 53.2 &#956;s) versus significantly long&#8208;lived triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#964;T = 114 &#956;s) was observed under deaerated experimental conditions. &#160;These information are useful for molecular structure design of triplet photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Keto&#8208;Sulfoxides from Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8208;80% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) ligands through target directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a novel class of possible antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE's VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption of metal&#8208;organic complexes on metallic surfaces to produce well&#8208;defined single site catalysts is a novel approach combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To avoid the &#8220;surface trans&#8208;effect&#8221; a dome&#8208;shaped molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an tolylazacalix[3](2,6)pyridine ligand is synthesized. This vacuum&#8208;evaporable complex both activates CO and reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form a Mo(VI) trioxo complex which in turn is capable of catalytically mediating oxygen transfer. The molybdenum tricarbonyl&#8208; and trioxo complexes are investigated in the solid state, in homogeneous solution and on noble metal surfaces (Cu, Au) employing a range of spectroscopic and analytical methods.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the relationship between atomic and electronic structures is a powerful tool to screen the wide variety of Zintl phases for interesting optoelectronic properties. To get an insight in such relations, the A10Tt2P6 system (A=Li&#8208;Cs; Tt=Si&#8208;Sn) was picked as model system to analyse the influence of structural motives, combination of elements and their properties on type and width of the band gaps. Those compounds comprise two interesting structural motives of their anions, which are either monomeric trigonal planar TtP35&#8208; units which are isostructural to CO32&#8208;&#160;&#160;or [Tt2P6]10&#8208; dimers which correspond to two edge&#8208;sharing TtP4 tetrahedra. The A10Tt2P6 compounds were structurally optimized for both polymorphs and subsequent frequency analysis, band structure as well as density of states calculations were performed. The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na10Si2P6, Na10Ge2P6 and K10Sn2P6 were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K10Sn2P6 was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x&#8208;ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and incorporates [Sn2P6]10&#8208; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57eV.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Linearly fused polycyclic piperidines represent common substructures in natural products and biologically active small molecules. We have devised a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to these compounds that converts readily available 2&#8208;tetralones and indanones into these scaffolds with the potential for control of both enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Importantly, these compounds can be chemoselectively functionalized, providing an efficient and robust methodology to these important nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic&#8208;Space for the Reactivity of Metal&#8208;free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The h&#8208;BN surface catalyzes the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in presence of dioxygen. The surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for the methane oxidation is demonstrated with numerous pathways. Distortion/interaction and orbital analysis are utilized to rationalize the activation barriers. Water plays an intriguing role in HCHO and CO formation.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal&#8208;free hexagonal&#8208;boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of h&#8208;BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms in h&#8208;BN reduce O2, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over h&#8208;BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition&#8208;metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally&#8208;mapped in&#8208;detail the surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of h&#8208;BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O2 binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths varies from ~83 to ~123&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over h&#8208;BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.

         <title>An Efficient C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Enabled by a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aryl radical from sulfonium salts have been generated through copper&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes, which enable the successful biaryl transformation through the addition to the aryl(trialkyl)silanes for the first time. Given the fast development in the copper catalysis, this method is expected to present new opportunities for exploring aryl(trialkyl)silanes in biaryl synthesis.







Abstract
The methods for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes are long&#8208;standing challenges due to the extreme inertness of C&#8722;Si(R3) bond, though the reaction is environmentally friendly and highly regioselective to synthesize biaryls. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes and aryl via a radical mechanism. The reaction proceeds efficiently with aryl sulfonium salts as limiting reagents, exhibits broad substrate scope, and provides an important synthetic strategy to acquire biaryls, exemplified by unsymmetrical fluorescence probes and late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Of note, the experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism where the copper catalyst and CsF play critical roles on the radical generation and desilylation process.

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective molecular recognition properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors toward the cis isomer of acetylated lysine (cis&#8208;Kac) are investigated. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex is favoured for the aryl&#8208;extended receptor compared to the superaryl&#8208;extended featuring a deeper cavity for which the energetically not favourable desolvation of the aminoacidic group hampers the guest inclusion in the hydrophobic cavity.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H&#8197;NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between receptor&#8197;1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H&#8197;NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor&#8197;1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.

         <title>The Origin of Dual&#8208;Emission in PLICT Compounds &#8211; an Empirical Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;emitting PLICT compounds based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures and exploration of their fluorescence behavior are presented. Combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations, and a unique fluorophore cataloging map allows for the easy determination of the origin of fluorescence bands.







Abstract
Fluorescence spectroscopy proves to be a powerful and versatile tool in scientific research, demanding ongoing advancements of fluorescence probes to cater to a broad range of applications. The particular interest lies in the development of fluorophores with multiplexing capability, emitting from more than one excited state depending on the polarity and viscosity of the surrounding medium. Here, we present a variety of novel dual planarized intramolecular charge transfer (PLICT) emitters based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures. We have chosen a combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations and the creation of a unique fluorophore cataloging map. This map serves as a useful tool for empirically determining the origin of both fluorescence bands.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transport properties of a series of double&#8208;layered Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices have been designed. It gives deep insight into the experimental discoveries, and provides theoretical guidance for optimizing the transport properties of the Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices.







Abstract
Encouraged by the successful fabrication of C60&#8208;GNR (GNR=graphene nanoribbon) single&#8208;molecule transistors in experiments, four Fe&#8208;containing derived double&#8208;layered devices of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR are designed by employing different electrode linkages and their transport properties are investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods. Regardless of electrode connection, all these devices give rise to a smaller negative differential resistance (NDR) peak at V=0.2 and a higher peak at 1.2&#8197;V, suggesting their stable maneuverability as molecular devices and good candidates for developing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) current switches. The macroscopic NDR performance depends on the delocalization character and the crossing mechanism of the frontier orbitals. The peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios (Rmax) range from 454 to 2737, determined by the electrode linkage. Such a large Rmax&#8208;value is necessary for developing dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM) cells. Encapsulating the Fe atom inside C60 not only improves the conductivity but also introduces the spin&#8208;polarized transport property. The spin&#8208;filtering efficiency (SFE) of almost all devices oscillates up and down in response to the bias voltage, indicating the possibility of designing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) spin switches and up&#8208;down spin switches. All these fascinating properties provide an important clue for designing similar molecular devices with multiple functions by trapping magnetic transition metal atoms inside fullerenes.

         <title>A Nanoplatform Based on Pillar[5]arene Nanovalves for Combined Drug Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene&#8208;based nanovalves improved drug loading capacity and endowed the nanoplatforms with dual pH/light responsiveness. The loaded DOX and GOx successfully achieved combined chemo/starvation cancer therapy with better tumor suppression compared to single chemotherapy, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Modern nanodrug delivery technologies offer new approaches in the fight against cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors and side effects of anticancer drugs, monotherapies are less effective. Herein, we report a novel pH and light dual&#8208;responsive nanodrug delivery platform. The platform was formed by sulfonate&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles loaded with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) and then covered by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene as a nanovalve. The nanovalve formed by the host&#8208;guest interaction between pillar[5]arene and the sulfonic acid group grafted onto the gold nanoparticle increased the drug loading capacity of the nanoplatform and enabled sustained release of the drug in a simulated weakly acidic tumor environment. The released GOx can consume intracellular glucose, namely, starvation therapy, while the generated hydrogen peroxide can further kill tumor cells, complementing DOX chemotherapy. Gold nanoparticles have good photothermal conversion ability and can enhance the drugs release rate under specific wavelengths of light irradiation. The results of in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments showed that this novel nanodrug delivery platform has good biocompatibility and better therapeutic efficacy relative to monotherapy. This study successfully developed a combined chemo/starvation therapy strategy with good tumor suppression, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of the chiral space inside a molecular host is an ideal platform for enantioselective reactions. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants because reactants must be trapped inside molecular hosts. Instead, we utilized the exteriors of chiral molecular capsules as chiral sources and realized the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Confined spaces inside molecular hosts can function as reaction vessels. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants. When the exterior of molecular hosts is used instead, we can ease the restriction because reactants are not necessary to be trapped inside molecular hosts, although studies along this line have not been reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of enantioselective reactions at the exterior of chiral molecular hosts, we utilized host&#8208;guest complexes of enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsules and guests possessing a catalytic center to realize the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Under suitable reaction conditions, a selectivity factor of 2.6 was realized, demonstrating that the reactions occur at the exterior of the capsules. A series of experiments indicated that the substituents on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms and the alkyl chains on the lower rim contributed to the enantioselectivity of the reactions.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of the Nonreducing Hexasaccharide Fragment and the Dodecasaccharide Scaffold of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of properly protected dodecasaccharide backbone of axinelloside A was accomplished by virtue of an Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The 1,2&#8208;cis configuration of the glycosidic bonds was well controlled by judicious choice of protecting groups as well as promotion conditions.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low&#8208;yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi&#8208;gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide. The requisite 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.

         <title>Accessing Rare &#945;&#8208;Heterocyclic Aziridines via Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;catalyzed Michael Addition/Annulation: Scope, Limitations, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition of anilines to trisubstituted heterocyclic chloroalkenes provides an intermediate 1,2&#8208;chloroamine. Diastereocontrol was found to vary significantly with solvent selection, with computational modelling confirming selective, spontaneous fragmentation in the presence of trace acids, proceeding through a pseudo&#8208;cyclic, protonated intermediate and transition state. These chloroamines can then be converted to the aziridine by treatment with LiHMDS with high stereochemical fidelity. This solvent&#8208;induced stereochemical enrichment thereby enables an efficient route to rare cis&#8208;aziridines with high dr. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic origins of selectivity are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomatizing Methoxylation of Phenols and Naphthols: Synthetic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxidative dearomatizing methoxylation of phenols and naphthols was developed. It provides an alternative route for the preparation of methoxycyclohexadienones, important and versatile synthetic intermediates, that eliminates the need for stoichiometric high&#8208;energy chemical oxidants and generates hydrogen as a sole by&#8208;product. The reaction proceeds in a simple constant current mode, in an undivided cell, and it employs standardized instrumentation. A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted phenols and 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side&#8208;reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.</dc:description>

A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6-tri-substituted phenols and 1-substituted-2-naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;-bi-2-naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure-selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side-reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of the Methylene Bridge Substitution in Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Mn(I) Catalyst for Ketone Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic modification of the chelating NHC&#8208;phosphine ligand (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) in highly efficient ketone hydrogenation Mn(I) catalyst fac&#8208;[(Ph2PCH2NHC)Mn(CO)3Br] has been performed and the catalytic activity of the resulting complexes was evaluated using acetophenone as a benchmark substrate. While the variation of phosphine and NHC moieties led to inferior results than for a parent system, the incorporation of a phenyl substituent into the ligand methylene bridge improved catalytic performance by ca. 3 times providing maximal TON values in the range of 15000&#8208;20000. Mechanistic investigation combining experimental and computational studies allowed to rationalize this beneficial effect as an enhanced stabilization of reaction intermediates including anionic hydride species fac&#8208;[(Ph2PC(Ph)NHC)Mn(CO)3H]&#8722; playing a crucial role in the hydrogenation process.

         <dc:description>Poly(vinyl chloride) undergoes dechlorination in the presence of triethylsilane (Et3SiH) and a catalytic amount of [Cp2Zr(NPh2)][CH3B(C6F5)3] (1b) at 40&#8208;80 &#176;C, with up to 91 % efficiency. Stoichiometric reactivity studies conducted on cyclohexyl chloride as a model suggest that 1b dechlorinates PVC by initial chloride abstraction, followed by hydride transfer to the cationic PVC chain from Et3SiH. Consumer items such as pipe fitting, vinyl disc or electric cable insulation undergo either dechlorination or hydrosilylation of the carbonyl&#8208;containing copolymer (polyvinyl acetate) or plasticizer (phthalate).</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Manganese(I) Catalyst for the Efficient and Selective Hydrophosphination of Olefins with PH3, Primary, and Secondary Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tridentate ligand L with a P,NH,N donor motif was synthesized in few steps from commercially available precursors. Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18&#8208;electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. Deprotonation of the NH group leads under loss of CO to a neutral Mn(I) amide complex [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;H)] (2), which has a trigonal bipyramidal structure with the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 gives the deep&#8208;blue anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8208; (3). DFT calculations and QTAIM analyses show that 2 contains a Mn&#8211;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8208; reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins with low catalytic activity. However, the neutral amide complex 2 is an excellent catalyst and with 0.04 mol%, turn over frequencies of &gt;40&#8217;000 h&#8209;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An asymmetric double desymmetrization methodology has been developed for synthesizing densely functionalized chiral cyclopentylcyclohexane scaffolds. We have constructed four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8208;C bond formation event. The methodology has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and delivers a broad range of enantioenriched products.

         <dc:description>Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the fields of aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and three&#8208;dimensional printing applications.&#160; While the fluorescent materials are prepared by the polymerization of fluorescent monomer or the blending a fluorescent dye with common polymer, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical technique.&#160; In this paper, dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized to be a stable nitrile N&#8208;oxide as the derivative of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde.&#160; While Dansyl&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to an alkene and an alkyne to give fluorescent Dansyl&#8208;Ene and Dansyl&#8208;Yne, respectively, it hardly reacts to a nitrile.&#160; The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.&#160; To know the effects of solvent on the fluorescent properties, the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra of Dansyl&#8208;Ene are measured in three solvents.&#160; Dansyl&#8208;Ene shows fluorescent solvatochromism, which appears to be red&#8208;shifted along with the increase in solvent polarity.&#160; Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) directly reacts with Dansyl&#8208;NO to give fluorescent modified SB.&#160; The emission spectrum of modified SB is blue&#8208;shifted compared with that of Dansyl&#8208;Ene.&#160; The blue&#8208;shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of modified SB.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of Steroidal Rotors Probed by Theoretical, Spectroscopic and Dielectric Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our study focuses on molecular rotors with fast&#8208;moving rotators and their potential applications in the development of new amphidynamic crystals. Steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group as the rotator were synthesized and characterized. Three different rotors were investigated with varying numbers of fluorine atoms. A comprehensive analysis was performed using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, FT&#8208;IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and dielectric response to understand the behavior of the investigated model rotors. The results were supported by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. The angle&#8208;dependent polarized Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of the samples. Nearly frequency and temperature&#8208;independent permittivity suggest low&#8208;frequency librational motion of stators. An in&#8208;depth analysis of ECD spectra revealed high conformational flexibility in solution, resulting in low ECD effects, while in the solid&#8208;state with restricted rotation, significant ECD effects were observed. These findings shed light on the conformational behavior and potential applications of the studied steroidal molecular rotors.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Design of 3D Current Collectors for Lithium Metal Anodes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g&#8208;1) and low redox potential (&#8208;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) received increasing attentions. However, notorious dendrite and volume expansion during the cycling process seriously hinder the development of high energy density Li metal batteries. Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collectors for Li can fundamentally solve the intrinsic drawback of hostless for Li. Therefore, this review systematically introduces the design and synthesis engineering and the current development status of different 3D collectors in recent years (the current collectors are divided into two major parts: metal&#8208;based current collectors and carbon&#8208;based current collectors). In the end, some perspectives of the future promotion for LMA application are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8722;situ  confining selenium within bubble&#8722;like carbon nanoshells for ultra&#8722;stable Li&#8722;Se batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8208;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long&#8208;term durability and high&#8208;rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top&#8208;down strategy through the in&#8208;situ trapping of amorphous Se within bubble&#8208;like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface&#8208;absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This in&#8208;situ trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6wt% is reached. Using the Se@void@BLC as cathode for Li&#8722;Se battery, we achieve a high initial Columbic efficiency of 84.2%, a high reversible capacity of 585 mAh g&#8722;1, and an ultralow capacity decay of only 0.0037 % per cycle during 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Azaphosphinate Dyes: A Low Molecular Weight Near&#8208;Infrared Scaffold for Development of Photoacoustic or Fluorescence Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new class of NIR dyes termed azaphosphinate NR dyes with desirable properties including low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750&#8197;nm, and remarkable water solubility. Derivatives of these dyes can be used for photoacoustic or fluorescence imaging, providing a new NIR scaffold for the design of imaging probes.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are desirable for biological imaging applications including photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. Nonetheless, current NIR dyes are often plagued by relatively large molecular weights, poor water solubility, and limited photostability. Herein, we provide the first examples of azaphosphinate dyes which display desirable properties such as low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750&#8197;nm, and remarkable water solubility. In PA imaging, an azaphosphinate dye exhibited a 4.1&#8208;fold enhancement in intensity compared to commonly used standards, the ability to multiplex with existing dyes in whole blood, imaging depths of 2.75&#8197;cm in a tissue model, and contrast in mice. An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed a &gt;10&#8208;fold reduction in photobleaching in water compared to the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green dye and could be visualized in mice. This new dye class provides a robust scaffold for the development of photoacoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging agents.

An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed a &amp;gt;10-fold reduction in photobleaching in water compared to the FDA-approved indocyanine green dye and could be visualized in mice. This new dye class provides a robust scaffold for the development of photoacoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mn(II) Promoted Divergent&#8208;Convergent Domino Reaction Giving Dinuclear Tetrasubstituted Pyrrole Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new domino reaction sequence has been realized between chelating heteroaryl methanamine and cheap and simple Mn(II) salt, leading to 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex. The reaction process has been studied and a six&#8208;step domino sequence involving the convergent [3+2] cycloaddition between imine and alkene/alkyne which were formed divergently from starting amine has been proposed.







Abstract
Domino reaction of benzo[d]thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;methylamine (S1) has been developed in the presence of MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex 1 ([MnClP]2, P&#8722;=2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time&#8208;dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent&#8208;convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound S1 could be activated by MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine II (1&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene C (1,2&#8208;bis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene) through oxidative self&#8208;condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate [MnClP] after aromatization. Dimerization of [MnClP] produces the final product 1. Three C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;N bond are formed through this six&#8208;step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (HP: 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazole)) has been obtained from 1 and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52&#8201;%) than the reported 3,4&#8208;diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(3,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)bis(benzo[d]thiazole) (DPB) (42&#8201;%).

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor with Contorted Hexabenzocoronene and Perylenediimide for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated molecular HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI with three&#8208;dimensional geometry is synthesized and applied as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor material in the active layer of organic solar cells.







Abstract
Although fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61/C71&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) have dominated the the photoactive acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades, they have several drawbacks such as weak absorption, limited structural tunability, prone to aggregation, and high costs of production. Constructing non&#8208;fullerene small molecules with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular geometry is one of the strategies to replace fullerenes in OSCs. In this study, a 3D molecule, contorted hexa&#8208;cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene tetra perylenediimide (HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI), was designed and synthesized. HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI shows a wide and strong light absorption in the whole UV&#8208;vis region as well as suitable energy levels as an acceptor for OSCs. More importantly, the 3D construction effectively reduced the self&#8208;aggregation of c&#8208;HBC, leading to an appropriate scale phase separation of the blend film morphology in OSCs. A preliminary power conversion efficiency of 2.70&#8201;% with a champion open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.06&#8197;V was obtained in OSCs with HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI as the acceptor, which was the highest among the previously reported OSCs based on c&#8208;HBC derivatives. The results indicated that HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI may serve as a good non&#8208;fullerene acceptor for OSCs.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;based Functional Glycopolymeric Nanoparticles as Fluorescent Probes for Selective Imaging of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalimide&#8208;based glycopolymeric nanoparticles with dual tumor&#8208;targeting ability from glucose&#8208;segment and phenylboronic ester modification were designed and used as pH sensitive and AIEgen fluorescent probes for selective imaging of tumor cells.







Abstract
A series of functional glycopolymer nanoparticles with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motif was designed, synthesized and applied for tumor cell imaging. With the pH&#8208;sensitive and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide fluorescent probe, the presence of glucose&#8208;based glycopolymers enhanced its water&#8208;solubility and biocompatibility. Owing to the dual tumor&#8208;targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.

         <title>Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient approach with a broad scope for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs is reported. The selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs can stain lipid droplets selectively, exhibiting fluorescence in both green and red channels. The Se&#8208;functionalized BODIPYs exhibit larger Stokes shifts than their precursors, and sensitization of 1O2 from triplet states formed by competitive intersystem crossing, which makes them suitable for bioimaging studies and, potentially, and simultaneously, for photodynamic therapy. The electrochemical synthetic method offers an efficient and versatile alternative for the preparation of Se&#8208;functionalized fluorescent compounds with relevant physicochemical and biological profiles. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Braunschweig, E.&#8197;N. da&#8197;Silva&#8197;J&#250;nior, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303883).

         <title>Regioselective Partial Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Tetracyclic (Hetero)aromatic Systems Using a Simple Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation is a powerful synthetic approach to biologically significant moieties. Herein, a hydrogenative, regioselective dearomatisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is described, using a simple Pd catalyst at atmospheric hydrogen pressure. Deuteration is also demonstrated and some initial mechanistic insights are revealed.







Abstract
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is a powerful synthetic approach. The abundance of starting materials and cross&#8208;coupling methodologies to access the precursors allows for highly diverse products. Subsequent selective partial reduction can alter the core structure in a manner of interest to medicinal chemists. Herein, we describe the precise, partial reduction of multicyclic heteroaromatic systems using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The approach can be extended to introduce deuterium (again at late&#8208;stage). Excellent yields can be obtained using simple reaction conditions.

         <title>Aptamer Clicked Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) at Au Nanoparticles as Platforms with Multiple Function[&#8224;]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Table of Contents: We present a novel poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;gold nanoparticle (PFS&#8208;AuNP) system for aptamer grafting. A multi&#8208;responsive aptamer&#8208;AuNP platform is described. This platform possesses high colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments and exhibits both a redox response and the specific sensitivity of the aptamer.







Abstract
Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin&#8208;specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox&#8208;active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co&#8208;reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer&#8208;PFS&#8208;AuNP composite (aptamer&#8208;AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer&#8208;AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness are studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized TADF small molecules capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing are believed to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. And their recent progress is highlighted so as to shed light on the development of efficient TADF polymers.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers show a great potential in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area and flexible full&#8208;color flat&#8208;panel displays. One of the most promising design rules is based on TADF+Linker, where a small molecular TADF unit is bonded to each other by a simple linker. Unlike the expensive vacuum deposition for small molecules, these polymerized TADF small molecules (Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs) are capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing. Meanwhile, the good luminescent property of small molecular TADF emitters can be well inherited by Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs so as to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. Herein, we will highlight the recent progress of Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs, together with emphasis on their molecular design, photophysical and electroluminescence properties.

         <title>Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL: A novel phosphinidene transfer reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallaphosphene 1 serves as a phosphinidene transfer reagent in reactions with RNHCs and isonitriles, to give RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes 2 and 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes 3, respectively. NHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidene 2&#8201;b reacted with THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 with selective B&#8722;H bond activation to the unique NHC&#8208;stabilized borane complex 4.







Abstract
Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2; Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) reacts with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes RNHC (RNHC=[CMeN(R)]2C; R=Me, iPr) to RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes RNHC&#8594;PGa(Cl)L (R=Me 2&#8201;a, iPr 2&#8201;b) and with isonitriles RNC (R=iPr, Cy) to 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes L(Cl)GaP=C=N&#8722;R (R=iPr 3&#8201;a, Cy 3&#8201;b), respectively. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b possess two localized lone pair of electrons, whereas 3&#8201;a/3&#8201;b only show one localized lone pair as was reported for gallaphosphene 1. 2&#8201;b reacts with 2.5&#8197;equivalents of a borane (THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3) to the NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene&#8208;borane complex [iPrNHC&#8594;P(BH2)]2(BH3)3 4 with concomitant formation of LGa(H)Cl 5. 2&#8211;5 are characterized by heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0) tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI) trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) is investigated in homogeneous solution and in a molecular film adsorbed on Au(111) using a variety of spectroscopic and analytical methods. These studies in particular show that the dome&#8208;shaped carbonyl complex adsorbed on the metal surface has the ability to bind and activate gaseous oxygen, overcoming the so&#8208;called surface trans&#8208;effect. Furthermore, the rate of the conversion dramatically increases by irradiation with light. This observation is explained with the help of complementary DFT calculations and attributed to two different pathways, a thermal and a photochemical one. Based on the experimental and theoretical findings, a molecular mechanism for the conversion of the carbonyl to the oxo complex is derived.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>alpha&#8208;Silylated diazoalkynes are stabilized diazo compounds that can selectively react with carboxylic residues in buffered aqueous media. In&#8208;situ fluoride induced desilylation increases this reactivity, leading to a very fast reaction. Application to the selective functionalization of RNase A, followed by post&#8208;functionalization using click chemistry, is described. These new reagents expand the toolbox for native protein modification at carboxylic residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Insulating 6,6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric Acid Methyl Ester on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides: Impact of the Hybrid Materials on the Optical and Electrical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we develop a strategy to insulate 6,6 &#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Concretely single layers of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 and ultrathin MoO2 and WO2 were grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the thiol group of a PCBM modified with cysteine reacts with the chalcogen vacancies on the basal plane of TMDs, yielding PCBM&#8208;MoS2, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WS2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2, PCBM&#8208;WTe2, PCBM&#8208;MoO2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700% and 200% in PCBM&#8208;MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM&#8208;MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2&#8208;fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1 eV. On the other hand, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2 and PCBM&#8208;WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8208;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37&#8208;154 eV along with an enhancement of the photo&#8208;response by 2400, 3200 and 600%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM&#8208;WTe2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2 showed a modest photo&#8208;response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence Promoted by AIE&#8208;active Chiral Co&#8208;assemblies in Liquid Crystal Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (glum) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2, which was prepared by chiral binary co&#8208;polymer (R/S&#8208;PB2) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (PTZ). For comparison, ternary co&#8208;polymerized LCP (R/S&#8208;PT) was synthesized by co&#8208;polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |glum| values of the co&#8208;assembled PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 were up to 0.13 at a 32 nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of R/S&#8208;PT (|glum| = 0.024). This is due to PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could form more orderly chiral co&#8208;assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the glum value, and the maximum glum&#160;of PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could be enhanced to 0.91&#160;at a 220 nm thickness.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Monolayer Catalysts: Towards Efficient Water Splitting and Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A viable alternative to non&#8208;renewable hydrocarbon fuels is hydrogen gas, created using a safe, environmentally friendly process like water splitting. An important role in water&#8208;splitting applications is played by the development of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), transition metal carbides (MXenes), graphene&#8208;derived 2D layered nanomaterials, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. Advanced synthesis methods and characterization instruments enabled an effective application for improved electrocatalytic water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production. Enhancing active sites, modifying the phase and electronic structure, adding conductive elements like transition metals, forming heterostructures, altering the defect state, etc., can improve the catalytic activity of 2D stacked hybrid monolayer nanomaterials. The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Anode Materials for Fast&#8208;charging Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast&#8208;charging technology is set to revolutionize the field of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), driving the creation of next&#8208;generation devices with the ability to get charged within a short span of time. From the anode perspective, it is of paramount importance to design materials that can withstand continuous Li+ insertion/deinsertion at high charging rates and still remain unaffected by factors such as mechanical fractures, electrolyte side reactions, polarisation, lithium plating and heat generation. Herein, the recent advancements in the design of amorphous materials as anodes for fast&#8208;charging LIBs have been discussed. While the development of this particular class of materials for application in high&#8208;rate anodes has been paid limited attention in recent literature, it holds immense promise for improving the fast&#8208;charging capabilities. This concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field, outlining the strategies employed in the design of amorphous anodes and emphasizing the crucial role played by its amorphous nature in achieving fast&#8208;charging performance. Further, the successive initiatives than can be undertaken to drive the progress of amorphous materials for fast charging LIBs have also been detailed, which could potentially improve their commercial viability.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances of Flexible MXene and its Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, rich surface chemistry, and convenient processability. These characteristics make them ideal for producing flexible materials with tunable microstructures. This paper reviews the laboratory research progress of flexible MXene and its composite materials for supercapacitors. And introduces the general synthesis method of MXene, as well as the preparation and properties of flexible MXene. By analyzing the current research status, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MXene was explained from the perspectives of electrolyte and surface terminating groups. This review particularly emphasizes the composite methods of freestanding flexible MXene composite materials. The review points out that the biggest problem with flexible MXene electrodes is severe self&#8208;stacking, which reduces the number of chemically active sites, weakens ion accessibility, and ultimately lowers electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to composite MXene with other electrode materials and design a good microstructure. This review affirms the enormous potential of flexible MXene and its composite materials in the field of supercapacitors. In addition, the challenges and possible improvements faced by MXene based materials in practical applications were also discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with exceptionally customizable composition and properties. MOFs intrinsically possess open metal sites, tunable pore size/shape and an ultra&#8208;large specific surface area, and have obtained significant attention over the past 30 years. Furthermore, through the integration of functional moieties such as, molecules, functional groups, noble metal clusters and nanocrystals or nanoparticles into MOFs, the resulting composites have greatly enriched the physical and chemical properties of pure MOFs, enabling their application in a wider range of fields. Triethylamine (TEA) as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOFs. In this Concept, the versatility of triethylamine when involved in the synthesis of MOFs is discussed. Four sections are used to elaborate on the role of TEA including: (1) Single crystal synthesis; (2) Size and morphology control; (3) Building block of MOFs; (4) MOFs composites synthesis. In the last part, we highlight the potential of TEA for further developments.</dc:description>

         <title>From the Iron Pentacarbonyl Cation to Heteroleptic &#951;6&#8208;arene Carbonyls and bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene Cations</title>

         <dc:description>Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]&#8226;+ (arene = 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)2]&#8226;+ was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF = C(CF3)3) salt. Chemical electronation, i.e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)2], whereas further deelectronation under CO&#8208;pressure leads to a dicationic three&#8208;legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)3]2+ salt with [Al(ORF)4]&#8211; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]&#8226;+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis&#8208;arene salts [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]2+([Al(ORF)4]&#8211;)2 (arene = 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis&#8208;arene cation salt [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8226;+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8226;+ salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C6H6)2]2+ salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.</dc:description>
