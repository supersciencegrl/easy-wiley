         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of their key roles in&#160;pathologies,&#160;miRNAs&#160;represent a promising class of therapeutic targets.&#160;While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified&#160;via&#160;high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling&#160;via&#160;copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Auxiliary&#8208;Mediated Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with Pyridine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A properly positioned pyridine ring can speed up auxiliary&#8208;mediated native chemical ligation. A methoxy substituent increases auxiliary stability and facilitates rapid syntheses of long and multiphosphorylated multirepeat proteins and of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclized peptides.







Abstract
To expand the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond reactions at cysteine, ligation auxiliaries are appended to the peptide N&#8208;terminus. After the introduction of a pyridine&#8208;containing auxiliary, which provided access to challenging junctions (proline or &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids), we herein probe the role of the pyridine&#8208;ring nitrogen. We observed side reactions leading to preliminary auxiliary loss. We describe a new easy to attach &#946;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinyl)&#8208;ethyl (MMPyE) auxiliary, which 1) has increased stability; 2) enables NCL at sterically encumbered junctions (e.&#8201;g., Leu&#8208;Val); and 3) allows removal under mildly basic (pH&#8197;8.5) conditions was introduced. The synthesis of a 120 aa long peptide containing eight MUC5AC tandem repeats via ligation of two 60mers demonstrates the usefulness. Making use of hitherto unexplored NCL to tyrosine, the MMPyE auxiliary provided access to a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;cyclized 21&#8208;mer peptide and a His6&#8208;tagged hexaphosphorylated peptide comprising 6 heptapeptide repeats of the RNA polymerase II C&#8208;terminal domain.

         <title>Analysis of the Magnetic Coupling in a Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II) Single Molecule Magnet</title>

Magnetization barrier in a {3&#8201;d&#8208;5&#8201;f&#8208;3&#8201;d} trimeric complex. The anisotropic magnetic properties of a {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II)} SMM are modelled using ab initio calculations and Spin Hamiltonians.The magnetic coupling is strongly anisotropic and leads to the magnetization barrier.







Abstract
[{Mn(TPA)I}{UO2(Mesaldien)}{Mn(TPA)I}]I formula (here TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine and Mesaldien=N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminomethyl)diethylenebis(salicylidene imine)) reported by Mazzanti and coworkers (Chatelain et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8211;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0&#8197;K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g&#8208;factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [UVO2]+ is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g&#8208;factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component JZ twice larger as the perpendicular one J&#8869;. The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the JZ/J&#8869; ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g&#8208;factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding gS&#8208;values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8211;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [UVO2]+ 5&#8201;f orbitals.

&lt;/sub&gt;. The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the &lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;/J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#8869;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g-factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8211;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [U&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 5&#8201;f orbitals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Stereocontrol: We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the key step for stereocontrol involves the participation of an interconverting planar chiral conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic starting material







Abstract
We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under optimized conditions, a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic nanoarchitectures allow myriads of chemical strategies for designing hybrid multifunctional materials containing magnetic and plasmonic nanoparticles. Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are explored in a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of a pesticide dissolved in water. The Fe3O4 particles assist the magnetic separation of the dendritic sorbents from aqueous samples for subsequent SERS analysis of molecular adsorbates on gold.

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>

Phase in, phase out: Investigations of the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell resulted in the synthesis of new &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phases at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively. Their structures are composed of PN6 octahedra. Upon decompression, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 transforms into the novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid that is stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding material properties. These properties mainly rely on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN6 octahedra frameworks being particularly attractive. In this study, the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system was studied up to 137&#8197;GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 were found to form at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN6 units. The two compounds are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K0=322&#8197;GPa for &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and 339&#8197;GPa for PN2. Upon decompression below 7&#8197;GPa, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through materials formed under high pressure.

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2] Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic route to strained cyclophanes is reported, which involves the unexpected photochemical fusion of a carboxylic ester and a non&#8208;activated methyl group. Functional experiments suggest that the previously overlooked C&#8722;C bond forming reaction involves an excited triplet state and intramolecular hydrogen abstraction. Using a flow reactor, a series of otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared







Abstract
The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes are an important target for synthesis since they are found in various chiral auxiliaries, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkably simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8722;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments, point to a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer. The new method proved to be robust and versatile enabling the synthesis of a range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers, and thus proved to be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox.

         <title>Two Novel Three&#8208;Dimensional Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Rare Earth MOFs with Ultra&#8208;High Proton Conductivity and Performance Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained by self&#8208;assembly; their three&#8208;dimensional frameworks provide a channel for proton conduction. Under high humidity, water molecules are adsorbed in the channel and form complex hydrogen bond networks, shown as lightning. Astronauts moving easily along the channel represent the effective transport of protons: proton conductivity reached a maximum value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Du, Q.&#8208;H. Zhao, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202154).

Under high humidity, water molecules are adsorbed in the channel and form complex hydrogen bond networks, shown as lightning. Astronauts moving easily along the channel represent the effective transport of protons: proton conductivity reached a maximum value of 2.63&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two do the job: Diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to a PNNP expanded pincer ligand are described. Deprotonation of the methylene linkers enables cooperative activation of H2 allowing for the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes under mild conditions. Initial insights into the mechanism and the isolation of a deactivated species with an unusual structure are provided.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of a new class of diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to the tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand is described. Reacting tBuPNNP with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh3)3(CO) at 140&#8201;&#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru2(tBuPNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO)2] (1) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KOtBu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru2(tBuPNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;OtBu)(CO)2] (3) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core. This enables metal&#8208;ligand cooperative activation of H2 analogous to the mononuclear analogue, [Ru(tBuPNP*)H(CO)]. In contrast to the mononuclear system, the bimetallic analogue 3 catalyzes the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes at ambient temperature and atmospheric H2 pressure with good functional group tolerance. Monitoring the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows the intermediacy of Z&#8208;stilbene, which is subsequently isomerized to the E&#8208;isomer. Initial findings into the mode of action of this system are provided, including the spectroscopic characterization of a polyhydride intermediate and the isolation of a deactivated species with a partially hydrogenated naphthyridine backbone.

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8211;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of a new THF&#8208;solvated, ferrocene&#8208;based Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base with all four components lithium, potassium, carbanion, and alkoxide led to the observation of new structural motifs with respect to these superbasic reagents. The &#8220;kick out&#8221; of a THF leads to the detachment, providing the typical Li/K reaction site, whereas the &#8220;smart pass&#8221; leads to the favorable THF&#8208;displacement and the K/K reaction site provided for substrates.







Abstract
The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert&#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho&#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene, an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8211;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base that is reported herein.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;DDMs for membrane proteins: A series of &#8220;hydrophobicity&#8208;neutral&#8221; linkers were incorporated between the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic maltose of the traditional detergent DDM. This remodeling strategy yielded T&#8208;DDMs, among which superior detergents with excellent physical properties and stabilization capability were identified, as illustrated in the NMR study of A2AAR.







Abstract
It is a pressing need, but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles is the limited availability of matched detergents for the handling of specific MPs. We describe herein the design of new detergents by incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between the outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in while retaining low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these that results will encourage future detergent expansion through new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.

         <title>Dynamic Interactions between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeting MscL. However, the detailed binding sites of BG to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, we investigated the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, we demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which we can develop new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8208;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78 &#956;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge transfer and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labeling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarized recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlighted our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology mimicking bacterial adhesins.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can realize high device efficiency by utilizing both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. And recently, the based on fused ketone/amine system exhibited huge potential for constructing multi resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher superiority for narrowband emission compared with conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarized the current research progress of both traditional and MR types ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the involved molecular design strategy of holding high&#8208;device efficiency and keeping narrowband emission profile simultaneously. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrowband materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Covalent Organic Frameworks for Multi Valent Metal Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Shining a Light on Photoresponsive Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free&#8208;flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non&#8208;porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release that involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO  2  over CH  4  , and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium (II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we tuned the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. We demonstrate the visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via C&#8722;P bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;terminal Cysteines using O&#8209;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards dual site&#8208;selective functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with consequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety into the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed under acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Propargylic Acetates for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenylboronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates leading to allenylboronates was developed. The method allows preparation of a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allenylboronates at room temperature with good functional group compatibility. Stereo&#173;chemical studies show that an anti&#8208;SN2&#8217; displacement of acetate by boron occurs, which also allows chirality transfer to yield enantiomerically enriched allenyl&#173;boronates. The synthetic utility of this protocol is further substantiated by transformations of the obtained allenylboronates including oxidation and propargylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond&#8208;Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multi&#8208;layered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only 5 steps, applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated via in situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potent Auto&#8208;Umpolung Ligand for Conjugative Radical Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenes with conjugatively connected redox system act as &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; ligands. Due to their electronic flexibility, they should also be particularly suitable to stabilize open&#8208;shell species Herein, the first neutral radical of such sort is described in form of a dialkylamino&#8208;substituted bis(dicyanomethylen)cyclopropanide. Despite the absence of steric shielding, the radical is stable for an extended amount of time and was consequently characterized in solution via EPR measurements. These data and accompanying X&#8208;ray structural analyses indicate that the radical species is in equilibrium with aggregates (formed via &#960;&#8208;stacking) and dimers (obtained via &#963;&#8208;bond formation between methylene carbons).</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Diaryl Quaternary Centers by Rh(II)/Xantphos Catalyzed Relay C&#8208;H Functionalization and Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction of  N, N  &#8208;disubstituted aniline, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and an allylic electrophile has been realized by [Rh(II)]  2  /Xantphos catalysis, providing a direct access to various aniline derivatives bearing diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by facile derivatization of the products for preparation of biologically relevant molecules and structural scaffolds, which offers a high potential for increasing the molecular diversity. Mechanistic studies identified &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate species as an active intermediate, thereby revealing the presence of a C(  sp  2  )&#8208;H functionalization of aniline derivatives/allylic alkylation cascade in this attractive catalytic transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectric Relaxation and Dielectric Switching Behaviors in (N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine) Tetrachloroantimonate(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric switches have drawn renewed attention to the study of their many potential applications with the adjustable switch temperatures (  T  s  ). Herein, a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor, (  N  ,  N  &#8208;diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate (  (DIPEA)SbCl  4  , DIPEA  +  =  N  ,  N  &#8208;diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound consisted of the coordinated anion  [[EQUATION]]  chains and isolated DIPEA  +  cations undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (  T  s  ). The variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structure analyses and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations give the information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics. This work enriches the dielectric switch family, and proves that hybrid metal halides are promising candidates for the switchable physical or chemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Insights of Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept, the recently representative progress of non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFRAs) for organic solar cells is highlighted by focusing on introducing the newly developed molecular design strategies and discussing the structure&#8208;performance relationships. A perspective on the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs is also discussed.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with fused&#8208;ring structures have rapidly improved the performance of organic solar cells over the past five years, but they still suffer from synthetic complexity and thus high material costs, one of the major obstacles of hindering their commercialization process. The construction of non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) has recently been regarded as a feasible solution due to their facile synthesis and satisfactory device performances. Thus in this concept, we highlight the important progress of NFRAs in recent years, and discuss the key relationship between molecular design strategies and device performance. Finally, we provide some potential molecular insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum Dynamical simulations predict that, following UV irradiation of the Guanine&#8208;Cytosine Watson&#8208;Crick pair in chloroform, 20&#8764;50&#8201;% of the photoexcited population decays to a Gua&#8594;Cyt Charge Transfer state within 100&#8197;fs. Different solvation models were used in an attempt to define the effects modulating this population transfer and to explain why it is less effective than in the gas phase.&#8221;







Abstract
We study the ultrafast photoactivated dynamics of the hydrogen bonded dimer Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in chloroform solution, focusing on the population of the Guanine&#8594;Cytosine charge transfer state (GC&#8208;CT), an important elementary process for the photophysics and photochemistry of nucleic acids. We integrate a quantum dynamics propagation scheme, based on a linear vibronic model parameterized through time dependent density functional theory calculations, with four different solvation models, either implicit or explicit. On average, after 50&#8197;fs, 30&#8764;40&#8201;% of the bright excited state population has been transferred to GC&#8208;CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC&#8208;CT is however disfavoured in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical&#8208;physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time&#8208;scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that the effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Variation and Sodium Storage Behavior of Polyoxometalates Encapsulated within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confining polyoxometalates (POMs) in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) influence the electronic structure of POMs. Electron transfer occurs not only between POMs and SWNTs, but also within a single POM cluster. Consequently, charge density on the bridged oxygen of POMs is prominently enhanced. The electron reconfiguration of POMs in POMs@SWNT significantly accelerate electron and ion transport, and improve electrochemical Na+ storage performance.







Abstract
The host&#8211;guest interaction can remarkably alter the physiochemical properties of composite materials. It is crucial to clarify the mechanism by revealing the influence of the host on the electronic structure of the guest molecules. Herein, we study the structural variation of polyoxometalates (POMs) after being confined in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). What we found is that in addition to the reported charge transfer from SWNT to POM, an intramolecular electron transfer within a single POM cluster can be observed in the POM@SWNT composites. Moreover, the charge density on the bridged oxygen of POMs is prominently enhanced. The structural change and electron reconfiguration of POMs upon encapsulation in SWNT significantly speed up electron and ion transport, leading to the improved electrochemical performance for sodium ions storage.

         <title>Unravelling Enzymatic Features in a Supramolecular Iridium Catalyst by Computational Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational calculations aiming at elucidating the reaction mechanism of a supramolecular iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylation enabled the identification of unique intermediates and transition states similar to those found in enzyme catalysis. The unexpected energies associated to the elementary steps are reached thanks to the relevant distortion effects at play, which are upgraded by the molecular&#8208;recognition pocket from the catalyst.

Non&#8208;biological catalysts following the governing principles of enzymes are attractive systems to disclose unprecedented reactivities. Most of those existing catalysts feature an adaptable molecular recognition site for substrate binding that are prone to undergo conformational selection pathways. Herein, we present a non&#8208;biological catalyst that is able to bind substrates via the induced fit model according to in&#8208;depth computational calculations. The system, which is constituted by an inflexible substrate&#8208;recognition site derived from a zinc&#8208;porphyrin in the second coordination sphere, features destabilization of ground states as well as stabilization of transition states for the relevant iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylation of pyridine. In addition, this catalyst appears to be most suited to tightly bind the transition state rather than the substrate. Besides these features, which are reminiscent of the action modes of enzymes, new elementary catalytic steps (i.&#8201;e. C&#8722;B bond formation and catalyst regeneration) have been disclosed owing to the unique distortions encountered in the different intermediates and transition states.

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Cyclic Ketones with Dehydroalanine via H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directing Enamine Catalysis: Straightforward Access to Enantiopure Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
A direct, highly enantioselective organocatalytic alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine via a conjugate addition reaction is reported. The use of a chiral bifunctional primary amine/thiourea catalyst was key to obtain the enantiopure, functionalized (substituted ketone) unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids in good yields and remarkable selectivity. The mechanism of the reactions was explored by mass spectrometry studies.







Abstract
The growing importance of structurally diverse and functionalized enantiomerically pure unnatural amino acids in the design of drugs, including peptides, has stimulated the development of new synthetic methods. This study reports the challenging direct asymmetric alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine derivatives via a conjugate addition reaction for the synthesis of enantiopure ketone&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids. The key to success was the design of a bifunctional primary amine&#8208;thiourea catalyst that combines H&#8208;bond&#8208;directing activation and enamine catalysis. The simultaneous dual activation of the two relatively unreactive partners, confirmed by mass spectrometry studies, results in high reactivity while securing high levels of stereocontrol. A broad substrate scope is accompanied by versatile downstream chemical modifications. The mild reaction conditions and consistently excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;95&#8201;%&#8197;ee in most cases) render this protocol highly practical for the rapid construction of valuable noncanonical enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid building blocks.

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Targeting Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Photodynamic Molecular Beacon for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photodynamic molecular beacon has been designed and synthesized, which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton which is activatable by the coexistence of glutathione and cathepsin B. It serves as a tumor&#8208;targeting and dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photosensitizer for precise photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
A multifunctional photodynamic molecular beacon (PMB) has been designed and synthesized which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton in which the three zinc(II) phthalocyanine units are each substituted with a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) quencher and are linked via two cathepsin B&#8208;cleavable GFLG peptide chains. This tailor&#8208;made conjugate is fully quenched in the native form due to the photoinduced electron transfer effect of the DNBS moieties and the self&#8208;quenching of the phthalocyanine units. It can target the EGFR overexpressed in cancer cells, and after receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, it can be activated selectively by the co&#8208;existence of intracellular GSH and cathepsin B, both of which are also overproduced in cancer cells, in terms of fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation. The cell&#8208;selective behavior of this PMB has been demonstrated using a range of cancer cells with different expression levels of EGFR, while the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been studied both in&#8197;vitro and in various aqueous media. The overall results show that this advanced PMB, which exhibits several levels of control of the tumor specificity, is a promising photosensitizer for precise antitumoral photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Amines and a Four&#8208;Armed Cyano&#8208;Substituted Luminophore through Hydrogen Bonds for Potential Development of Smart Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;armed cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene luminophore was synthesized, which can spontaneously co&#8208;assemble with chiral amines through intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds, resulting in characteristic chiroptical properties at both ground state and excited state.







Abstract
Chirality transfer from chiral molecules to assemblies is of vital importance to the design of functional chiral materials. In this work, selective co&#8208;assembly behaviors between chiral molecules and an achiral luminophore, potentially driven by the intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds are reported. Cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene carboxylic acid (TA) served as the luminophore and hydrogen bond donors, which underwent co&#8208;assembly with different chiral amines. It was found that structures of chiral amines affect the chirality transfer and the properties of co&#8208;assemblies due to effects on hydrogen bonds and stacking pattern. Only in specific co&#8208;assemblies, the chiroptical properties occurred at both ground state and excited states based on the emerged Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals, revealing that the chirality was successfully transferred from molecular level to supramolecular level. In addition, accurate quantitative examination of chiral amines was realized by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This work demonstrates the characteristic chirality response and transfer through co&#8208;assembly, providing a potential method to develop smart chiroptical materials.

         <title>Heterobimetallic Gold/Ruthenium Complexes Synthesized via Post&#8208;functionalization and Applied in Dual Photoredox Gold Catalysis</title>

Acting in concert: Novel heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes synthesized in a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction are reported. The applied post&#8208;functionalization strategy allows which isomer is obtained to be controlled. Their application as catalysts in carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;coupling showed that the dinuclear complexes can outperform their monometallic counterparts







Abstract
The synthesis of heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes of the general formula syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 is reported. The ditopic bridging ligand L1&#8745;L2 refers to a P,N hybrid ligand composed of phosphine and bipyridine substructures, which was obtained via a post&#8208;functionalization strategy based on Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a phosphole and a maleimide moiety. It was found that the stereochemistry at the phosphorus atom of the resulting 7&#8208;phosphanorbornene backbone can be controlled by executing the metal coordination and the cycloaddition reaction in a different order. All precursors, as well as the mono&#8208; and multimetallic complexes, were isolated and fully characterized by various spectroscopic methods such as NMR, IR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Photophysical measurements show efficient phosphorescence for the investigated monometallic complex anti&#8208;[(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 and the bimetallic analogue syn&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2, thus indicating a small influence of the {AuCl} fragment on the photoluminescence properties. The heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 are both active catalysts in the P&#8208;arylation of aryldiazonium salts promoted by visible light with H&#8208;phosphonate affording arylphosphonates in yields of up to 91&#8201;%. Both dinuclear complexes outperform their monometallic counterparts.

All precursors, as well as the mono- and multimetallic complexes, were isolated and fully characterized by various spectroscopic methods such as NMR, IR, and UV-vis spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Photophysical measurements show efficient phosphorescence for the investigated monometallic complex &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-[(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;&#8745;&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;){Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the bimetallic analogue &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-[{AuCl}(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;&#8745;&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;){Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus indicating a small influence of the {AuCl} fragment on the photoluminescence properties. The heterobimetallic Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-[{AuCl}(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;&#8745;&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;){Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are both active catalysts in the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-arylation of aryldiazonium salts promoted by visible light with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-phosphonate affording arylphosphonates in yields of up to 91&#8201;%. Both dinuclear complexes outperform their monometallic counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights on the Lewis Superacid Al(OTeF5)3: Solvent Adducts, Characterization and Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimeric Lewis superacid [Al(OTeF5)3]2 and its solvent adducts are ready to test their strength in terms of fluoride ion affinity. While some of them are still highly reactive, others had too much coordinating solvent and remain stable but comparably unreactive. In here, their preparation, characterization and reactivity are reported in detail.







Abstract
Preparation and characterization of the dimeric Lewis superacid [Al(OTeF5)3]2 and various solvent adducts is presented. The latter range from thermally stable adducts to highly reactive, weakly bound species. DFT calculations on the ligand affinity of these Lewis acids were performed in order to rank their remaining Lewis acidity. An experimental proof of the Lewis acidity is provided by the reaction of solvent&#8208;adducts of Al(OTeF5)3 with [PPh4][SbF6] and OPEt3, respectively. Furthermore, their reactivity towards chloride and pentafluoroorthotellurate salts as well as (CH3)3SiCl and (CH3)3SiF is shown. This includes the formation of the dianion [Al(OTeF5)5]2&#8722;.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Octahedral Iron(II) Complexes with Near&#8208;Degenerate Charge Transfer and Ligand Field States at the Franck&#8208;Condon Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>

Iron(II) complexes with 6,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;carboxypyridyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;methylamine&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyridine ligands possess low&#8208;energy 1MLCT states. 3MLCT and 3/5MC excited states are nearly degenerate at the Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. Expansion of the coordination sphere lowers the 3/5MC energies shortening the 3MLCT lifetime. Cooling and solvent reorganization occurs within 33&#8197;ps to give the relaxed 5MC state with ca. 0.5&#8197;ns lifetime.







Abstract
Increasing the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state lifetime of polypyridine iron(II) complexes can be achieved by lowering the ligand's &#960;* orbital energy and by increasing the ligand field splitting. In the homo&#8208; and heteroleptic complexes [Fe(cpmp)2]2+ (12+) and [Fe(cpmp)(ddpd)]2+ (22+) with the tridentate ligands 6,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;carboxypyridyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;methylamine&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyridine (cpmp) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) two or one dipyridyl ketone moieties provide low energy &#960;* acceptor orbitals. A good metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap to increase the ligand field splitting is achieved by optimizing the octahedricity through CO and NMe units between the coordinating pyridines which enable the formation of six&#8208;membered chelate rings. The push&#8208;pull ligand cpmp provides intra&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT, LL'CT) excited states in addition to MLCT excited states. Ground and excited state properties of 12+ and 22+ were accessed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, resonance Raman spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemistry, EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy, static and time&#8208;resolved IR and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Bonding Situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H Complexes in Transition Metal and Main Group Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controversial bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E=Si, B) complexes in transition metal and main&#8208;group compounds is quantitatively analyzed by means of computational tools. This study sheds light on the crucial role of backdonation to determine the possible &#951;1 or &#951;2 coordination modes.







Abstract
The ambiguous bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E=Si, B) complexes in transition metal compounds has been rationalized by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, the combination of the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) method and its Natural Orbital for Chemical Valance (NOCV) extension has been applied to representative complexes described in the literature where the possible &#951;1 versus &#951;2 coordination mode is not unambiguously defined. Our quantitative analyses, which complement previous data based on the application of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approach, indicate that there exists a continuum between genuine &#951;1 and &#951;2 modes depending mainly on the strength of the backdonation. Finally, we also applied this EDA&#8208;NOCV approach to related main&#8208;group species where the backdonation is minimal.

Pyrimidopteridine organic photoredox catalysts are applied in a formal addition of carboxylic acids to activated alkenes as a dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalysts. Electron&#8208;rich alkenes counter the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids upon single&#8208;electron oxidation and a selective hydroacetoxylation is observed.







Abstract
Herein we report a photo&#8208;mediated formal addition of carboxylic acids to activated alkenes catalyzed by a pyrimidopteridine photoredox catalyst. The decarboxylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids upon single&#8208;electron oxidation is countered in the presence of electron&#8208;rich alkenes and a hydroacetoxylation is observed. Mechanistic proposals have been made based on CV measurements, competitive Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching and EPR experiments. Evidence that tetra&#8208;N&#8208;substituted pyrimidopteridines function as dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalyst was supported by spectroscopic means.

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting of Black Silicon Photoanode with pH&#8208;Dependent Copper&#8208;Bipyridine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on black Si (b&#8208;Si) to improve its water splitting performance. Notably, b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with the lowest overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V and Tafel slop of 241&#8197;mV/dec at pH&#8197;11. Mechanism studies indicate that the formation of dimer complex at pH&#8197;11 could generate O&#8722;O bond via redox isomerization, resulting in low overpotential for efficient water oxidation.







Abstract
Since the water oxidation half&#8208;reaction requires the transfer of multi&#8208;electrons and the formation of O&#8722;O bond, it's crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si, b&#8208;Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5 VRHE at pH&#8197;11.0, which is dramatically improved from the b&#8208;Si photoanode (1.03&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2) and f&#8208;Si photoanode (0.0087&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Mechanism studies demonstrate that b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light&#8208;harvesting, interfacial charge&#8208;transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly, b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241&#8197;mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V at pH&#8197;11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH &#8764;11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl&#8208;complex could form O&#8722;O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Molecular Design of Silicon&#8208;Containing Diazenes: Absorbance of E and Z Isomers in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistable structures containing two silicon atoms (with any coordination number: III, IV, V) at the &#8722;N=N&#8722; fragment are characterized by the absorption of E and Z isomers in the near IR region and by a surprising separation of their first bands.







Abstract
The effective use of photochromic systems based on azo compounds in a number of applications, especially biomedical and pharmacological ones, is impeded by the unresolved problem of their E&#8646;Z isomerization in the near&#8208;IR region, NIR (780&#8211;1400&#8197;nm). We have demonstrated at the TD&#8208;DFT, STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD and CASSCF&#8208;NEVPT2 levels of theory that the presence of a silylated diazene core &#8722;Si&#8722;N=N&#8722;Si&#8722; with three&#8208;, tetra&#8208; or five&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms practically guarantees the absorption of the E and Z forms of such derivatives in NIR and the amazing (185&#8211;400&#8197;nm) separation of their first absorption bands. In particular, the maximum &#955;1 of the first n&#8594;&#960;* band of the E isomer of azosilabenzene ASiB is at &#8764;1030&#8197;nm, while for the Z isomer &#955;1&#8773;1340&#8197;nm. Based on the found bistable azo compounds (ASiB, bis(silyl)&#8208; SiD and bis(silatranyl)&#8208; SaD diazenes) and their derivatives with E and Z absorption in NIR, unique photoswitches can be created for a number of applications, in particular, for photothermal therapy.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Conjugated Dienes: Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of Piperazines and 2&#8208;Piperazinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of conjugated dienes has been developed using ethanediamine and &#945;&#8208;amino amide derivatives as nitrogen sources respectively. A variety of valuable substituted piperazines and 2&#8208;piperazinones were synthesized in good yields and with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Dinitrogen heterocycles are among the most important molecular structures, and the synthesis of these types of structures through intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins is a direct and efficient method. However, the types of nitrogen sources are mostly derived from ureas or arylamines, and nitrogen sources from aliphatic amines are still limited due to their distinct electronic and steric effects. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of conjugated dienes, using ethanediamine and &#945;&#8208;amino amide derivatives as nitrogen sources respectively, for the synthesis of piperazines and 2&#8208;piperazinones in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities.

         <title>Water Sorption Controls Extreme Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Molecular Reorganization in Hydrogen Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds are shown to undergo extreme molecular restructuring in response to stimuli (heat, vacuum, humidity). This restructuring involves the complete rotation of both building blocks and occurs in a single crystal to single crystal manner resulting in reversible high enthalpy water sorption in a 3D hydrogen bonded framework.







Abstract
As hydrogen bonded frameworks are held together by relatively weak interactions, they often form several different frameworks under slightly different synthesis conditions and respond dynamically to stimuli such as heat and vacuum. However, these dynamic restructuring processes are often poorly understood. In this work, three isoreticular hydrogen bonded organic frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted amidinium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxylate hydrogen bonds (1C/C, 1Si/C and 1Si/Si) are studied. Three distinct phases for 1C/C and four for 1Si/C and 1Si/Si are fully structurally characterized. The transitions between these phases involve extreme yet recoverable molecular&#8208;level framework reorganization. It is demonstrated that these transformations are related to water content and can be controlled by humidity, and that the non&#8208;porous anhydrous phase of 1C/C shows reversible water sorption through single crystal to crystal restructuring. This mechanistic insight opens the way for the future use of the inherent dynamism present in hydrogen bonded frameworks.

&lt;/b&gt; shows reversible water sorption through single crystal to crystal restructuring. This mechanistic insight opens the way for the future use of the inherent dynamism present in hydrogen bonded frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Recognition by DARPIns through Epitope/Paratope Analogy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DARPins are proteins able to specifically recognize G&#8208;quadruplexes. Their small size combined with their easy design makes them a good competitor to antibodies for the identification and localization of G&#8208;quadruplex. Using molecular dynamics calculations, we show that the selectivity of DARPins towards G&#8208;quadruplexes is achieved by the recognition of a structural motif adopted by the DNA filament folding.







Abstract
We investigated the mechanisms leading to the specific recognition of Guanine Guadruplex (G4) by DARPins peptides, which can lead to the design of G4&#8197;s specific sensors. To this end we carried out all&#8208;atom molecular dynamic simulations to unravel the interactions between specific nucleic acids, including human&#8208;telomeric (h&#8208;telo), Bcl&#8208;2, and c&#8208;Myc, with different peptides, forming a DARPin/G4 complex. By comparing the sequences of DARPin with that of a peptide known for its high affinity for c&#8208;Myc, we show that the recognition cannot be ascribed to sequence similarity but, instead, depends on the complementarity between the three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of the molecular fragments involved: the &#945;&#8208;helix/loops domain of DARPin and the G4 backbone. Our results reveal that DARPins tertiary structure presents a charged hollow region in which G4 can be hosted, thus the more complementary the structural shapes, the more stable the interaction.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Conversion of an Unstable Imine Cage to a Stable Cage with Amide Moieties Towards Selective Receptor for Fluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust cage (C2) and macrocycle (M2) were constructed via the formation of imine&#8208;based analogues (C1/M1) followed by post&#8208;synthesis conversion of imine bonds to amides. The cage C2 exhibited selective fluoride binding over chloride and, it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and oxyanions.







Abstract
Synthesis of robust covalent macrocycles/cages via multiple amide&#8208;bond forming reaction is highly challenging and generally it needs multistep reactions. One&#8208;pot reaction of appropriate di&#8208;/tri&#8208;acyl chloride with a diamine generally results polymers or oligomers instead of discrete architectures. To overcome this limitation, a strategy is reported here using dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction of imine&#8208;based macrocycle and cage upon treatment of a diamine with di&#8208; and tri&#8208;aldehydes respectively, followed by post&#8208;synthesis one&#8208;step conversion of imine bonds to amides to form the desired robust macrocycle and cage containing multiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found to form aggregates in DMSO, the cage was intact without any aggregation. Six amide groups in the confined pocket of the cage made it an ideal receptor for selective binding of fluoride with very high selectivity (&#8764;3
103 fold) over chloride, and it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and other oxyanions.

         <title>In Situ Ternary Adduct Formation of Yttrium Polyaminocarboxylates Leads to Small Molecule Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8197;situ formation of ternary adducts of yttrium(III) polyaminocarboxylate complexes with the endogenous molecules pyruvate, bicarbonate or acetate are investigated using 13C&#8197;NMR, SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised NMR, and DFT. A novel [Y(EDTA)(pyruvate hydrate)(H2O)]2&#8722; adduct is linked to decomposition of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO2 highlighting the potential of these adducts for capture and activation of small molecules.







Abstract
In this work the chemistry of yttrium complexes is exploited for small molecule capture and activation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies were used to investigate the in&#8197;situ formation of solution state ternary yttrium&#8208;acetate, yttrium&#8208;bicarbonate, and yttrium&#8208;pyruvate adducts with a range of polyaminocarboxylate chelates. These studies reveal that [Y(DO3A)(H2O)2] (H3DO3A &#8211; 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;tricarboxylic acid) and [Y(EDTA)(H2O)q]&#8722; (H4EDTA &#8211; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, q = 2 and 3) are able to form ternary adducts with bicarbonate and pyruvate. In the latter, unusual decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO2 was observed and further studied using SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised 13C&#8197;NMR (SABRE &#8211; signal amplification by reversible exchange) to provide information about the reaction timescale and lifetime of intermediates involved in this conversion. The work presented demonstrates that yttrium complexes can capture and activate small molecules, which may lead to novel and useful applications of this metal in catalysis and medical imaging.

Site&#8208;directed screening? Formylglycine (red) is a reactive amino acid that can be utilized in fragment ligation assays. Incorporated into a site&#8208;directing hexapeptide it can effectively probe the active site of PTP1B, yielding new phosphotyrosine mimetics derived from different nucleophiles, such as aryl amines (green).







Abstract
Discovery of protein&#8208;binding fragments for precisely defined binding sites is an unmet challenge to date. Herein, formylglycine is investigated as a molecular probe for the sensitive detection of fragments binding to a spatially defined protein site . Formylglycine peptide 3 was derived from a phosphotyrosine&#8208;containing peptide substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by replacing the phosphorylated amino acid with the reactive electrophile. Fragment ligation with formylglycine occurred in&#8197;situ in aqueous physiological buffer. Structures and kinetics were validated by NMR spectroscopy. Screening and hit validation revealed fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated hit fragments being able to replace the native phosphotyrosine residue. The formylglycine probe identified low&#8208;affinity fragments with high spatial resolution as substantiated by molecular modelling. The best fragment hit, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl&#8208;acetic acid, was converted into a cellularly active, nanomolar inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.

         <title>Front Cover: Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform (Chem. Eur. J. 57/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 57, October 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer in solvent: Guanine is illustrated transferring an electron to cytosine in chloroform after the absorption of light. This is the first step of a deactivation pathway observed previously in experiment, which could also be operative in DNA, that was simulated here by using quantum dynamics. We investigated the role of the solvent, an effect commonly missing in these calculations, and demonstrated that it modulates the conversion from the initially excited &#960;&#960;* states, depicted by two wireframe potential energy surfaces intersecting. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;A. Green, F. Santoro, R. Improta and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201731).

Enjoying the sun: The cover illustrates the potential of heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes to facilitate the P arylation of H&#8208;phosphonates with diazonium salts, while visible light kicks off the dual gold and photoredox catalytic cycle. The underlying structure of the catalysts&#8217; coordinating ligand system is accessible by a novel postfunctionalization approach, and the stereochemistry can be controlled by the order of metal coordination and click reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Breher and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201856).

         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with fused&#8208;ring structures have rapidly improved the performance of organic solar cells over the past five years, but they suffer from synthetic complexity and high material costs. Constructing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) has recently been regarded as a feasible solution to this due to their simple synthesis and satisfactory device performances. Herein, the authors highlight the important progress of NFRAs in recent years, and discuss the key relationship between molecular design strategies and device performance. For more information, see the Concept by Z. Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201675)

[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase can heterolytically cleave H2 and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate. Fruitful results have been achieved from studies on enzyme function, structure, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, biomimetic model development and artificial enzyme construction. But application scenarios of this enzyme are still in absence.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, the third type of natural hydrogenase, is capable to heterolytically activate hydrogen molecule and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate, making it a promising hydrogenation catalyst. Over the last three decades, fruitful results on this enzyme have been achieved. In this review, we have summarized the major progresses about this enzyme including its structural characterisation, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, mimetic model development as well as artificial enzymes construction. In the meanwhile, challenges and opportunities of this enzyme and its mimetic systems in the application of synthetic chemistry and others are discussed.

&#8220;We demonstrate the counter&#8208;intuitive effect that an increase in polarity of the medium&#8230; disfavours population of the charge transfer state in the ultrafast time regime.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201731).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of G.&#8197;A. Worth, F. Santoro and R. Improta at UCL, ICOOM&#8208;CNR and IBB&#8208;CNR.

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical evolution of polyketide natural products leads to the unprecedented combination of biosynthetically related fragments in arrangements not found in Nature. The pseudo&#8208;natural product grismonone was identified to be a potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling &#8211; a bioactivity that is not shared by its guiding fragments.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NPs in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs may also yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction in Water to Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazines as Switchable DSEgens, AIEgens, and ACQgens
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions realized the discovery of DSEgens with switchable capacity to AIEgens and ACQgens under mild reaction conditions. (DSE=dual&#8208;state emission, AIE=aggregation&#8208;induced emissions, ACQ=aggregation&#8208;caused quenching).







Abstract
Dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) luminophores exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid states, filling the gaps between aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). However, limited design concepts and complicated synthetic strategies restrict the discovery of novel DSE molecules. Developing efficient and green methodologies to access novel DSE scaffolds via rational design remains highly desirable. In this work, we report a water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine derivatives with DSE properties. The intramolecular interactions of the neighboring benzene rings restrict molecular motion, leading to emissions in the solid state (quantum yield: 11&#8201;%), and the newly constructed core structure of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine ensures considerable planarity, allowing for emissions in solution. Further removal of the neighboring phenyl groups resulted in ACQgens, while additional methyl groups led to AIEgens. Subsequent live cell imaging investigations suggested that the novel DSEgens could serve as specific lipid droplet (LD) probes in a wide concentration range.

         <title>Chemoselective Coupling of &#960;&#8208;Systems to Access Metallated 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;Skipped Dienes in Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembling metallated skipped dienes employing C&#8722;C &#960; systems in intermolecular fashion requires the chemoselective activation of either of the components by transition metals. In this Concept article, a clear picture of advancements in the synthesis of skipped dienes decorated with metallic groups (boron and silicon) is described. In addition, recent discoveries are highlighted in depth, emphasizing mechanistic studies, where paradigm shifts resulting from the substrate&#8208;chelation can be anticipated.







Abstract
Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8722;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8722;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.&#8201;g., [Si]&#8722;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, this article attempts to include all precedents, including recent studies by the authors. The present Concept article may be helpful for researchers working in this area as it provides a basic conceptual framework.

Three kinds of chiral cyclic compounds and their mirror&#8208;image isomers are described. The cover was created by using a &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; motif to project the three pairs of enantiomers in the central hexagon. The kaleidoscope is an optical device invented in the 19th century as a result of experiments on polarized light; the word &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221;, derived from the Greek kalos &#8220;beautiful&#8221;, was used to represent the beautiful and circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Hasegawa, Y. Mazaki, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202218).

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Emission and Aggregate Emission of Aroyl&#8208; S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals Are Controlled and Tuned by Their Substitution Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By expanding the library of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals to 111 examples, it was possible to fully control their photophysical properties &#8211; ranging from emission color to quantum yield &#8211; in the solid and aggregated states. Thorough analysis then allowed all aspects of these properties to be tuned.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are a novel highly diverse class of aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogens (AIEgens) with a plethora of interesting properties. An expanded compound library of more than 110 dyes set the stage for the first qualitative control and tuneability of all aspects of their photophysical properties. The interplay of substituents not only allows tuning and prediction of the emission color, but also of the intensity, and quantum yields both in solids and in the aggregated state; these can be rationalized by scrutinizing intermolecular interactions in the crystalline solid state.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By expanding the library&lt;/b&gt; of aroyl-&lt;i&gt;S,N&lt;/i&gt;-ketene acetals to 111 examples, it was possible to fully control their photophysical properties &#8211; ranging from emission color to quantum yield &#8211; in the solid and aggregated states. Thorough analysis then allowed all aspects of these properties to be tuned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aroyl-&lt;i&gt;S,N&lt;/i&gt;-ketene acetals are a novel highly diverse class of aggregation-induced emission fluorogens (AIEgens) with a plethora of interesting properties. An expanded compound library of more than 110 dyes set the stage for the first qualitative control and tuneability of all aspects of their photophysical properties. The interplay of substituents not only allows tuning and prediction of the emission color, but also of the intensity, and quantum yields both in solids and in the aggregated state; these can be rationalized by scrutinizing intermolecular interactions in the crystalline solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Differential Tunneling&#8208;Driven and Vibrationally&#8208;Induced Reactivity in Isomeric Benzazirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum tunneling and IR vibrational excitation chemistry was discovered to manifest differently in two isomeric benzazirines generated in cryogenic matrices. Computations show that these reactive intermediates have distinct energy profiles regarding two competitive bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathways. These exceptional results allow probing into the fundamental nature of such unconventional types of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling of heavy&#8208;atoms and vibrational excitation chemistry are unconventional and scarcely explored types of reactivity. Once fully understood, they might bring new avenues to conduct chemical transformations, providing access to a new world of molecules or ways of exquisite reaction control. In this context, we present here the discovery of two isomeric benzazirines exhibiting differential tunneling&#8208;driven and vibrationally&#8208;induced reactivity, which constitute exceptional results for probing into the nature of these phenomena. The isomeric 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;benzazirines (3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s) were generated in cryogenic krypton matrices by visible&#8208;light irradiation of the corresponding triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a, which was produced by UV&#8208;light irradiation of its azide precursor. The 3&#8242;&#8208;s was found to be stable under matrix dark conditions, whereas 3&#8208;a spontaneously rearranges (&#964;1/2 &#8764;64&#8197;h at 10 and 20&#8197;K) by heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to 32&#8208;a. Near&#8208;IR&#8208;light irradiation at the first OH stretching overtone frequencies (remote vibrational antenna) of the benzazirines induces the 3&#8242;&#8208;s ring&#8208;expansion reaction to a seven&#8208;member cyclic ketenimine, but the 3&#8208;a undergoes 2H&#8208;azirine ring&#8208;opening reaction to triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a. Computations demonstrate that 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s have distinct reaction energy profiles, which explain the different experimental results. The spectroscopic direct measurement of the tunneling of 3&#8208;a to 32&#8208;a constitutes a unique example of an observation of a species reacting only by nitrogen tunneling. Moreover, the vibrationally&#8208;induced sole activation of the most favorable bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathway available for 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s provides pioneer results regarding the selective nature of such processes.

         <title>Aluminum&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8208;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the molecular aluminum dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminum dihydride in the C&#8208;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;dependent Functionalities of Temporally&#8208;controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (  RA  ) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i)  RA  acts as a conventional fluorogenic  1  O  2  sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with  1  O  2  . (ii)  RA  acts as a temporally&#8208;controlled  1  O  2  sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (~700 nm) photosensitization.  RA  enters an intermediate state after capturing  1  O  2  and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii)  RA  acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate  1  O  2  under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and  RA  shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in  RA  offer to promise molecular tools to apply  1  O  2  in a spatiotemporal manner.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Enantiomeric Resolution and Enantiomer Isolation of&#160;H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregate from Aqueous Solution is enabled by Vortexes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protonated achiral H2TPPS4 spontaneously self&#8208;arranges at acids pH and high ionic strength to build mesoscopic J&#8208;aggregates that are intrinsically chiral. According to the symmetry rule aggregation leads to a racemate that, however, can be unbalanced by chemical (chiral pollutants) or physical stimuli (as vortexing the solution). Vortexing the title racemate, in principle, might either induce chiral separation or chiral enrichment. Indeed, herein it is shown that vortices enable the resolution of this racemic solution exploiting the tendency to deposit, onto the quartz cuvette walls, of the enantiomer favoured by the stirring sense. Simultaneously, over time, it was found that the opposite chiral conformation becomes prevalent in solution realizing a significant enantiomeric resolution. Therefore, after removing all stirring&#8208;favoured chiral J&#8208;aggregate from the solution, the recovering and isolating of the desired enantiomers from the cuvette walls was successfully obtained without complex procedures. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that the stirring forces are executively able to fulfil the chiral separation in H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregates, employed as model of a self&#8208;assembled system in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Formed in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury&#8217;s toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which the linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enable dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk), which is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the P. furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, and PAC spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, and 199Hg&#8208;NMR, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments form preferentially homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH, which is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a method for divergent copper salt controlled reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and  N  &#8208;fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI). Specifically, in the presence of CuX  2  (X = Cl, Br), the cyclopropanes underwent  formal  umpolung 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation bifunctionalization via a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening process to afford 1,3&#8208;aminochlorination and 1,3&#8208;aminobromination products in moderate to good yields. In addition, by using CuI as a catalyst, we synthesized various aminoindane derivatives via 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation cyclizations of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, the reactions involved a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening and subsequent ring expansion via C&#8211;H bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Radical Additions of Aromatic Acids to Vinyl Boronic Esters and gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new method to access &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem &#8208;diborylalkanes, by direct deoxygenative radical addition of aromatic carboxylic acids to gem &#8208;dibortlalkenes, is described. The reaction proceeds under mild photoredox catalysis and involves the photochemical C&#8211;O bond activation of aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of PPh 3 . It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with gem &#8208;diborylalkenes to form an &#945;&#8208; gem&#8208; diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, e.g., gem &#8208;Ar, Bpin&#8208;alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of an Antimicrobial Enterobactin&#8208;Muraymycin Conjugate for Improved Activity against Gram&#8208;negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming increasing antibiotic resistance requires the development of novel antibacterial agents that address new targets in bacterial cells. Naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics (such as muraymycins) inhibit the bacterial membrane protein MraY, a clinically unexploited essential enzyme in peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis. Even though a range of synthetic muraymycin analogues has already been reported, they generally suffer from limited cellular uptake and a lack of activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We herein report an approach to overcome these hurdles: a synthetic muraymycin analogue has been conjugated to a siderophore, i.e. the enterobactin derivative EntKL, to increase the cellular uptake into Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The resultant conjugate showed significantly improved antibacterial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain, thus providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of this novel approach and a starting point for the future optimisation of such conjugates towards potent agents against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Photocatalytic Activity of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks Used as Metallaphotocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multivariate approach allows to incorporate several functionalities into a single covalent organic framework (COF) and consequently allows the construction of bifunctional materials for cooperative catalysis. The well&#8208;defined structure of such multivariate COFs is furthermore ideally suited for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. We report a series of multivariate COFs that contain acridine&#8208; and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto&#8208;enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge&#8208;separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel&#8208;loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross&#8208;couplings even using red light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography.  In vitro  experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts.  In vivo  experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8208;Cp)2MoCl2  and the in vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Reactivity of Imine Ester: Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Imino Esters by Phenylsilane and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light mediated chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;aryl imino esters was demonstrated. The methodology allowed the efficient and practical preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. The mechanism of the reaction was probed by DFT calculations, and deuteration experiments indicated deuterium was introduced into amino acid esters efficiently (up to 99&#8201;% D ratio), enabling a feasible way to obtain deuterated amino acids using D2O as a cheap deuterium source.

         <title>Anion Recognition with Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) Triaryl&#8208;Based Pnictogen Bonding Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) pnictogen bonding (PnB) triaryl&#8208;based anion receptors demonstrate PnB anion binding strength is influenced strongly by the electronic withdrawing nature of the aryl substituent and pnictogen atom donor identity. The triaryl PnB receptors display chloride anion selectivity over a range of halides and oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding investigations of the first mixed PnB&#8208;HB anion host systems are also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a library of acyclic antimony(III) and bismuth(III) triaryl pnictogen bonding (PnB) receptor systems are reported. In the first&#8208;generation receptor series, quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR chloride titration experiments in THF solvent media reveal halide anion binding potency is intimately correlated with both the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl&#8208; substituent and the polarisability of the PnB donor. Further extensive anion binding investigations with the most potent Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;based PnB receptors: 1&#8901;Sb2CF3 and 1&#8901;Bi2CF3, reveal novel selectivity profiles, both displaying Cl&#8722; selectivity relative to the heavier halides and, impressively, to a range of highly basic oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding studies of a series of novel tripodal tris&#8208;proto&#8208;triazole triaryl Sb(III) and Bi(III) mixed PnB&#8208;HB receptor systems are also described. Whereas parent triphenyl Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds are incapable of binding Cl&#8722; in THF solvent media, the PnB&#8208;triazole HB host systems exhibit notable halide affinity.

         <title>Observing Nearby Nuclei on Paramagnetic Trityls and MOFs via DNP and Electron Decoupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron decoupling (eDec) attenuates the electron&#8208;nuclei hyperfine interaction (depicted as the magenta sphere) and, thus, improves the NMR sensitivity by &#8764;80&#8201;%. Furthermore, the combined DNP and eDec technique reveals that the intramolecular nuclei in trityl and paramagnetic MgHOTP MOF are outside the spin diffusion barrier.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR sensitivity enhancement technique that mediates polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to NMR&#8208;active nuclei. Despite its success in elucidating important structural information on biological and inorganic materials, the detailed polarization&#8208;transfer pathway from the electrons to the nearby and then the bulk solvent nuclei, and finally to the molecules of interest&#8208;remains unclear. In particular, the nuclei in the paramagnetic polarizing agent play significant roles in relaying the enhanced NMR polarizations to more remote nuclei. Despite their importance, the direct NMR observation of these nuclei is challenging because of poor sensitivity. Here, we show that a combined DNP and electron decoupling approach can facilitate direct NMR detection of these nuclei. We achieved an &#8764;80&#8201;% improvement in NMR intensity via electron decoupling at 0.35&#8197;T and 80&#8197;K on trityl radicals. Moreover, we recorded a DNP enhancement factor of 
 &#8764;90 and &#8764;11&#8201;% higher NMR intensity using electron decoupling on paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic framework, magnesium hexaoxytriphenylene (MgHOTP MOF).

         <title>Sterically and Electronically Flexible Pyridylidene Amine Dinitrogen Ligands at Palladium: Hemilabile cis/trans Coordination and Application in Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N,N,N&#8208;pyridylidene&#8211;amine (PYE) was synthesized, and its coordination to palladium was investigated. A flexible and hemilabile behavior of the ligand was put in light in terms of donation properties (zwitterionic vs. neutral) and in terms of geometry (cis/trans coordination). The complexes were found to catalytically dehydrogenate formic acid in CO2 and H2 in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity.







Abstract
Ligand design is crucial for the development of new catalysts and materials with new properties. Herein, the synthesis and unique hemilabile coordination properties of new bis&#8208;pyridylidene amine (bis&#8208;PYE) ligands to palladium, and preliminary catalytic activity of these complexes in formic acid dehydrogenation are described. The synthetic pathway to form cationic complexes [Pd(bis&#8208;PYE)Cl(L)]X with a cis&#8208;coordinated N,N&#8208;bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand is flexible and provides access to a diversity of PdII complexes with different ancillary ligands (L=pyridine, DMAP, PPh3, Cl, P(OMe)3). The 1H&#8197;NMR chemical shift of the trans&#8208;positioned PYE N&#8722;CH3 unit is identified as a convenient and diagnostic handle to probe the donor properties of these ancillary ligands and demonstrates the electronic flexibility of the PYE ligand sites. In the presence of a base, the originally cis&#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;PYE ligand adopts a N,N,N&#8208;tridentate coordination mode with the two PYE units in mutual trans position. This cis&#8211;trans isomerization is reverted in presence of an acid, demonstrating a unique structural and steric flexibility of the bis&#8208;PYE ligand at palladium in addition to its electronic adaptability. The palladium complexes are active in formic acid dehydrogenation to H2 and CO2. The catalytic performance is directly dependent on the ligand bonding mode, the nature of the ancillary ligand, the counteranion, and additives. The most active system features a bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand, PPh3 as ancillary ligand and accomplishes turnover frequencies up to 525&#8197;h&#8722;1 in the first hour and turnover numbers of nearly 1000, which is the highest activity reported for palladium&#8208;based catalysts to date.

         <title>Bicomponent Cocatalyst Decoration on Flux&#8208;assisted CaTaO2N Single Crystals for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined CaTaO2N single crystals with uniform particle size were successfully synthesized through a one&#8208;pot NaCl&#8208;assisted nitridation procedure. The performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO by H2O under visible light was enhanced due to the high crystallinity of CaTaO2N and the modification with core&#8208;shell structured Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst.







Abstract
Cubic&#8208;like CaTaO2N photocatalysts with high crystallinity and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by the flux&#8208;assisted nitridation method. The growth of CaTaO2N single crystals under different synthesis conditions was systematically investigated to understand the effects of the crystallinity and optical property on photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction. Moreover, the modification of CaTaO2N single crystals with core&#8208;shell Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst by two&#8208;step decoration process gave a 2.4 times higher amount of CO evolution than the deposition of sole Ag cocatalyst, because of the synergistic effects of bicomponent cocatalyst on the interfacial electron transfer and surface catalytic process. This study provides a valuable way to construct high&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts with effective bicomponent cocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Rational Design of a Triple Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform for Enhanced Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of responsive nanoplatforms based on the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Concentrating on a single TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform, however, may result in insufficient diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Herein, layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs) and rare earth nanomaterials (Er@Lu) were combined to create a triple TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform that was then modified with cypate (a fluorescent dye with strong absorbance) by a peptide chain and loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a chemotherapeutic drug. Multiple responses to TME occurred when Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG reached the colorectal tumor region. Based on an acidic TME, the nanoplatform cracked and released Ni  2+  and EGCG. NiS, which was produced by the reaction of Ni  2+  with abundant H  2  S in tumor cells, was used for photothermal therapy and the released EGCG was used for chemotherapy. The MMP&#8208;7 enzyme specifically expressed in tumor cells recognized and cut the peptide chain, resulting in cypate release. The fluorescence of the Er@Lu was then restored along with the release of cypate because of the absorption competition disappearance. Compared to a single TME response, Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG with a triple TME response led to a better synergistic therapeutic effect  in vitro  and  in vivo  . This work has provided new approaches for developing multiple TME&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoplatforms for synergistic therapy with improved diagnosis and therapeutic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Silver&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Metal&#8208;Centred Chirality versus DNA Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When covalently incorporating ligands capable of forming chiral metal complexes into a DNA oligonucleotide duplex, an enantiospecific formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs is possible. We have been investigating the chirality of the silver&#8208;mediated base pair  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  (  P  , 1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthroline) depending on the number of consecutive  P  :  P  pairs within a series of duplexes. Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3&#8208;(1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthrolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal&#8208;mediated base pairs. The same chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  pairs, irrespective of whether (  S  )&#8208;  P  or (  R  )&#8208;  P  is used. With six silver&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (  S  )&#8208;  P  but not for (  R  )&#8208;  P  . This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal&#8208;centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of the Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition &#8211; Retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [2+2] cycloaddition &#8211; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8211;RE) reaction is a &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non&#8208;concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro&#8208;electrocyclization step, simple first&#8208;order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by p&#8208;system and the steric hinderance by bulky groups. Herein we report a new class of boryl radicals with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) adducts ligated by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by CAAC ligand and the weak but significant B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8208;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.</dc:description>

Harnessing the heavy atom effect is the most useful way for boosting reverse intersystem crossing process for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters aiming to shorten the excited state lifetime and enhance the emission efficiency. A detailed investigation on S&#8208;containing TADF molecules featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer excited state shows that the heavier and bigger atom may have adverse effect because of its multiple roles.







Abstract
The harnessing of heavy atom effect of chalcogen elements offers a way for boosting the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of purely organic luminescent materials that can harvest triplet excitons. However, the conformational and electronic variations induced by the heavy and large atoms may also have adverse effects on the TADF properties. Herein, the design, synthesis, and structures of a new type of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emitters containing benzothiazino[2,3,4&#8208;kl]phenothiazine (DPTZ) as the donor unit are reported. The influences of S atoms on the emission properties have been systematically investigated by means of theoretical simulations, electrochemical and spectroscopic studies. Although the presence of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and calculated spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) values are beneficial for TSCT&#8208;TADF properties, the triplet TSCT states are uplifted to above the locally excited (LE) state of the acceptor moieties. As a result, the new emitters display longer delayed fluorescence lifetimes (&#964;DF) of 255.0&#8211;114.3&#8197;&#956;s and lower PLQYs of 45&#8211;61&#8201;% in comparison with the O&#8208;containing congeners (&#964;DF=26.9&#8211;6.8&#8197;&#956;s; PLQYs=74&#8211;71&#8201;%). This work highlights that a full consideration of various effects is essential when making use of heavy chalcogen atoms for the design of TADF emitters.

         <title>Regulating Oxygen Configuration in Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low oxygen content (particularly low C&#8722;O/C=O ratio) and high graphitization degree of hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets are responsible for the enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate and durable Na+ storage.







Abstract
Surface oxygen functionalities (particularly C&#8722;O configuration) in carbon materials have negative influence on their electrical conductivity and Na+ storage performance. Herein, we propose a concept from surface chemistry to regulate the oxygen configuration in hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNS). It is demonstrated that the C&#8722;O/C=O ratio in HPCNS reduces from 1.49 to 0.43 and its graphitization degree increases by increasing the carbonization temperature under a reduction atmosphere. Remarkably, such high graphitization degree and low C&#8722;O content of the HPCNS&#8208;800 are favorable for promoting its electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate (323.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 138.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and durable (96&#8201;% capacity retention over 5700&#8197;cycles at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) Na+ storage performance. This work permits the optimization of heteroatom configurations in carbon for superior Na+ storage.

         <title>Competitive Photoisomerization and Energy Transfer Processes in Fluorescent Multichromophoric Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multichromophoric systems showing both fluorescence and photoisomerization were investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. We highlight the prominent role of intramolecular homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between the different isomers of the chromophores at the origin of their peculiar photophysical and photochemical properties.







Abstract
Multichromophoric systems showing both fluorescence and photoisomerization are fascinating, with complex interchromophoric interactions. The experimental and theoretical study of a series of compounds, bearing a variable number of 4&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;6&#8208;(p&#8208;(N&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl)aminostyryl)&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) units are reported. The photophysical properties of multi&#8208;DCM derivatives, namely 2DCM and 3DCM, were compared to the single model azido&#8208;functionalized DCM, in the E and Z isomers. The (EE)&#8208;2DCM and (EEE)&#8208;3DCM were synthesized via the click reaction. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and photokinetics experiments under UV or visible irradiation indicated the presence of intramolecular energy transfer processes among the DCM units. Homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between adjacent chromophores were confirmed by fluorescence anisotropy and decays. Molecular dynamics simulations for 2DCM were carried out and analyzed using a Markov state model, providing geometrical parameters (orientation and distance between chromophores) and energy transfer efficiency. This work contributes to a better understanding and rationalization of multiple energy transfer processes occuring within multichromophoric systems.

         <title>How Water and Ion Mobility Affect the NMR Fingerprints of the Hydrated JBW Zeolite: A Combined Computational&#8208;Experimental Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovering the aluminium location is a challenging endeavour in zeolites, as overlapping resonances complicate spectral assignment. Combining theoretical and experimental NMR is indispensable in spectral interpretation while the inclusion of configurationally diverse water molecules is essential.







Abstract
An important aspect within zeolite synthesis is to make fully tunable framework materials with controlled aluminium distribution. A major challenge in characterising these zeolites at operating conditions is the presence of water. In this work, we investigate the effect of hydration on the 27Al NMR parameters of the ultracrystalline K,Na&#8208;compensated aluminosilicate JBW zeolite using experimental and computational techniques. The JBW framework, with Si/Al ratio of 1, is an ideal benchmark system as a stepping stone towards more complicated zeolites. The presence and mobility of water and extraframework species directly affect NMR fingerprints. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained provided dynamic methods are employed with hydrated structural models. This work shows how NMR is instrumental in characterising aluminium distributions in zeolites at operating conditions.

Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained provided dynamic methods are employed with hydrated structural models. This work shows how NMR is instrumental in characterising aluminium distributions in zeolites at operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, for which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Naphthalenediimides with High&#8208;Efficiency Fluorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) have been extensively studied due to their tunable luminescent properties. However, generally, the monomers or aggregates of non&#8208;core substituted NDIs exhibit low fluorescence quantum yields (&#1060;  FL  &lt; 10%) in the solid state, which limit their applications as light&#8208;emitting materials and render their chiral species unsuitable for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we report a series of non&#8208;core substituted chiral NDIs that exhibit high luminous efficiencies (&#1060;  FL  up to 56.8% for racemate and 36.5% for enantiomer) and a strong CPL behavior in the solid state. These significant improvements are attributed to the unique molecular conformation of the chiral NDIs and the formation of distinctive discrete dimers. The structures of the NDIs were significantly simpler and more accessible than those of other NDIs. The findings evidence that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs can exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state and provide a new pathway to improve photophysical properties of NDIs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report visible light&#8208;promoted single nickel catalysis for diverse carbon&#8208;heteroatom couplings under mild conditions. This mild, general, and robust method to couple diverse nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles with aryl(heteroaryl)/alkenyl iodides/bromides exhibits a wide range of functional group tolerance and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. On the base of preliminary mechanistic studies, a NiI/NiIII cycle was tentatively proposed via the generation of active NiI complexes that appear from homolysis of NiII&#8208;I rather than NiII&#8208;aryl bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Emitters for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S  1  )&#8208;triplet (T  1  ) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by the vibronic mixing with higher excited states S   n=2,3,4,&#8230;   and T   n=2,3,4,&#8230;   . For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA&#8208;DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time resolved near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of  18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in  n  BuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved  18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5 &#181;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve  18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1% and 30&#177;3% using only 2.5 &#181;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases catalyze ring opening reactions of cyclic epoxides with diverse anionic nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles. This work shows that, in addition to azide and cyanide, these enzymes facilitate ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyanate, thiocyanate, formate, and nitrite, significantly expanding the known repertoire of accessible transformations.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G-type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G-type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly unusual solid&#8208;state epitaxy&#8208;induced phase transformation of Na4SnS4&#183;14H2O (I) into Na4Sn2S6&#183;5H2O (II) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid&#8208;base reaction to form [SnS3SH]3&#8208; which condensate to [Sn2S6]4&#8208;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8208;H bond cleavage, S2&#8208; protonation, Sn&#8208;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8208;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn2S6]4&#8208;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8208;situ1H NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover &#8776;0.38&#160;%/h.

         <title>Synthesis, Post&#8208;Functionalization and Properties of Diphosphapentaarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linearly&#8208;fused poliarenes are an important class of compounds with high relevance in materials science. While modifying the shape and size represents a common means to fine&#8208;tune their properties, the precise placement of heteroatoms is strategy that is receiving an increasing deal of attention to overcome the intrinsic limitations of all&#8208; carbon structures. Thus, linearly&#8208;fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein,&#160;we report the synthesis, phosphorus post&#8208;functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium Hydride Cation Dimer Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes and H2 Isotope Exchange: Competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca Bridges and Terminal Ca&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH  2  CaL]  2+  (macrocyclic ligand L = NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me  4  TACD) showed remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H  2  isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH  +  . In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H  2  isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene. THF&#8208;coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition while strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dithiolopyrrolones are Prochelators that Are Activated by Glutathione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs), such as holomycin, are natural products that hold promise as scaffolds for antibiotics as they exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. They consist of a unique bicyclic core containing a disulfide that is crucial for their biological activity. Herein, we establish the DTPs as prochelators. We show that the disulfides are reduced at cellular gluathione levels. This activates the drugs and initiates interactions with targets, particularly metal coordination. In addition, we report an expedient synthesis for the DTPs thiolutin and aureothricin, providing facile access to important natural DTPs and derivatives thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing netlike nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with hetero&#8208;junction as robust material for electrochemical amine detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8 &#956;A mM  &#8722;1  and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25 &#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Rechargeable Sodium Metal Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been widely studied owing to the relatively high energy density and abundant resources. However, they still need systematic improvement to fulfill the harsh operating conditions for the commercialization of SMBs. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on SMBs in terms of Na anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing to Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs have been summarized. In addition, the insertion&#8208;type cathode materials and conversion&#8208;type cathode materials have also been introduced. Finally, the future outlook for the practical SMBs has been provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesopores P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow spheres for enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. We report a simultaneous loading of Ni  2  P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P photocatalyst. Ni  2  P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of sodium pentaphospholide Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] towards C&#8801;E (E = C, N, P) triple bonds.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A diglyme solution of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] (1) reacts with alkynes and the isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to afford the otherwise elusive (aza)phospholide anions 2a&#8208;c, 4a,b, and 6. The reaction of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggest a concerted mechanism for the formation of 2a and 4b. The anions 2a&#8208;c, 4a,b, and 6 coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards Fe(II) to give the sandwich (aza)phosphametallocenes 3a&#8208;c, 5a,b and 7 in moderate to good yields. The new compounds were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydride&#8208;Substituted Homoleptic Silylborate: How Similar is it to its Diborane(6)&#8208;Dianion Isostere?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The B&#8208;nucleophilic 9H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene dianion reacts with 9&#8208;chloro&#8208;9&#8208;silafluorene to afford air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable silylborate salts M[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2] (M[HBSiH], M = Li, Na). Li[HBSiH] and Me3SiCl give the B&#8722;pyridine adduct Ar2(py)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2 ((py)BSiH) or the chlorosilane Li[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(Cl)Ar2] (Li[HBSiCl]) in C6H6&#8208;pyridine or THF. In both cases, the first step is H&#8722; abstraction at the B center. The resulting free borane subsequently binds a py or thf ligand. While the py adduct is stable at room temperature, the thf adduct undergoes a 1,2&#8208;H shift via the cyclic B(&#956;&#8208;H)Si intermediate BHSi, which is afterwards attacked at the Si atom by a Cl&#8722; ion to give Li[HBSiCl]. DFT calculations were employed to support the proposed reaction mechanism and to characterize the electronic structure of BHSi. Treatment of Li[HBSiCl] with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IMe introduces the neutral donor at the Si atom and leads to Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(IMe)Ar2 (HBSi(IMe)), a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;stabilized silylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed&#160;Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist&#8217;s collection of photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the action of a strong Lewis acid, isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, is triggered, which in turn directly attacks an aromatic species in an electrophilic aromatic substitution.







Abstract
Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical SEAr mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H/E (E=electrophile) substitution under formal H+ elimination. Herein, we report an unusual variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)3, is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C6F5)3) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the SEAr mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.

         <title>Bismuth Gadolinium Oxychloride with a Remarkable Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive O2 Evolution Activity Promoted by Iodine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodine&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl with a significantly promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive O2&#8208;evolving performance of 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm is reported. The incorporation of I&#8722; ions causes the extended light absorption and promoted charge separation.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive bismuth&#8208;based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi2GdO4Cl to synthetize I&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl (denoted as yI&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2). The incorporation of I&#8722; ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open&#8208;circuit voltage decay. The O2&#8208;evolving performances of 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&#8722; ion and IrO2 loaded 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl are tremendously enhanced by ca. 4 and 45&#8197;times compared to pristine Bi2GdO4Cl. Notably, The O2 evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The synthetic iodine&#8208;doped photocatalyst remains stable after long&#8208;term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential in the field of photocatalysis.

Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl to synthetize I-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (denoted as yI&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2). The incorporation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open-circuit voltage decay. The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evolving performances of 1I&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion and IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loaded 1I&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl are tremendously enhanced by ca. 4 and 45&#8197;times compared to pristine Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. Notably, The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The synthetic iodine-doped photocatalyst remains stable after long-term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential in the field of photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of Alkali&#8208;Treated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of OH&#8722; and Metal Cations for Almost 100&#8201;% Selectivity of CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for alkali&#8208;treated photocatalyst in CO2 photoreduction is studied, especially for demonstrating the role of OH&#8722; and metal cations in detail for highly selective production of CO. DFT calculations confirmed that K ions enhance the charge density of nearby atoms to stabilize CO* groups and reduce the reaction energy barrier, inducing the switch of CH4 to CO.







Abstract
In this work, the modulation of activity and selectivity via photoreduction of carbon dioxide under simulated sunlight was achieved by treating P25 and P25/Pt NPs with KOH. It found that KOH treatment could significantly improve the overall conversion efficiency and switch the selectivity for CO. Photoelectric characterizations and CO2&#8208;TPD demonstrated that the synergistic effect of K+ and OH&#8208; accelerated the separation and migration of photogenerated charges, and also improved CO2 adsorption level. Significantly, the K ions could act as active sites for CO2 adsorption and further activation. In situ FTIR measurements and DFT calculations confirmed that K+ enhanced the charge density of adjacent atoms and stabilize CO* groups, reducing the reaction energy barrier and inducing the switching of original CH4 to CO, which played a selective regulatory role. This study provides insights into the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of alkali&#8208;treated photocatalysts and facilitates the design of efficient and product&#8208;specific photocatalysis.

Insight into a sustainable and environmentally valuable technology: Benefitting from superior chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area, functional nanomaterials&#8208;based electrocathodes, nanostructured photocathodes, and semiconductor nanomaterials have been recognized as promising candidates for microbial CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals. This minireview surveys the latest advances in the rational design of nanomaterials for different types of microbial CO2 reduction systems.







Abstract
Microbial electro&#8208; and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction represents an opportunity to tackle the environmental demand for sustainable fuel production. Nanomaterials critically impact the electricity&#8208; and solar&#8208;driven microbial CO2 reduction processes. This minireview comprehensively summarizes the recent developments in the configuration and design of nanomaterials for enhancement of the bacterial adhesion and extracellular electron transfer (EET) processes, based on the modification technologies of improving chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area. Furthermore, the investigation of incorporating non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms using advanced light&#8208;harvesting nanostructured photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, as well as the current understanding of EET mechanisms occurring at photosynthetic semiconductor nanomaterials&#8208;bacteria biohybrid interface is detailed. The crucial factors influencing the performance of microbial CO2 reduction systems and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the realization of their large&#8208;scale application.

         <title>&#8220;Activated Borane&#8221; &#8211; A Porous Borane Cluster Network as an Effective Adsorbent for Removing Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous polymer: Thermolysis of nido&#8208;B10H14 and toluene at 250&#8201;&#176;C affords the novel microporous polymer named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;. Analyses suggests an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties. Activated borane displays a high surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, thermal stability under Ar up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C, and sorption capacity to emerging pollutants exceeding the capacity of commercial activated carbon.







Abstract
The unprecedented co&#8208;thermolysis of decaborane(14) (nido&#8208;B10H14) and toluene results in a novel porous material (that we have named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;) containing micropores between 1.0 and 1.5&#8197;nm in diameter and a specific surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (Ar, 87&#8197;K) that is thermally stable up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Solid state 1H, 11B and 13C&#8197;MAS NMR, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopies suggest an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties in a ratio of about three toluene molecules for every borane cluster. In addition, the structure contains Lewis&#8208;acidic tri&#8208;coordinated boron sites giving it some unique properties. Activated borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially&#8208;available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make activated borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.

         <title>Intermetallic Nanocrystals: Seed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Applications in Electrocatalytic Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention as electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge, although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. The seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach is a promising tool for precise control over these parameters of IMNCs.







Abstract
In recent years, intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge to the traditional method of high&#8208;temperature annealing although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. Controllable synthesis of IMNCs by the wet chemistry method in the liquid phase shows great potential compared with the traditional high&#8208;temperature annealing method. In this Review, we attempt to summarize the preparation of IMNCs by the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis in the liquid phase, as well as their applications in electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Several representative examples are purposely selected for highlighting the huge potential of the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach in chemical synthesis. Specifically, we personally perceive the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach as a promising tool in the future for precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing the outcome: A silyl group at the alkyne terminal of secondary propargyl alcohols temporarily inverted the enantio&#8208;recognition of natural lipases. Using this phenomenon, the lipase/oxovanadium co&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic alcohols achieved enantiodivergent production of R and S enantiomers in high yield and with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on the size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with the R enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only R enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining S enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols by using a well&#8208;known R&#8208;selective Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. We have already reported R&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, and the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving a high efficiency of the DKR.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A = CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8208;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Mechanism of Substrate Oxidation in Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases: Insight from Theoretical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper enzymes that today comprise a large enzyme superfamily, grouped into the distinct members AA9&#8211;AA17 (with AA12 exempted). The LMPOs have the potential to facilitate the up&#8208;cycling of biomass waste products by boosting the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides. The cellulose bio&#8208;polymer is the main component of biomass waste and comprises thus a large, unexploited resource. The LMPOs work through a catalytic, oxidative reaction whose mechanism is still controversial. For instance, the nature of the intermediate performing the oxidative reaction is an open question, and the same holds for the employed co&#8208;substrate. We here review theoretical investigations addressing these questions. The applied theoretical methods are usually based on quantum mechanics (QM), often combined with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the employed theoretical methods and comment on the interplay between theoretical and experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Chemical Knowledge and Machine Learning for Performance Prediction of Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent years have witnessed a boom of machine learning (ML) applications in chemistry, which reveals the potential of data&#8208;driven prediction of synthesis performance. Digitalization and ML modelling are the key strategies to fully exploit the unique potential within the synergistic interplay between experimental data and the robust prediction of performance and selectivity. A series of exciting studies have demonstrated the importance of chemical knowledge implementation in ML, which improves the model&#8217;s capability for making predictions that are challenging and often go beyond the abilities of human beings. This Minireview summarizes the cuttingedge embedding techniques and model designs in syntheses prediction, elaborating how chemical knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning until June 2022. By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope that this Minireview can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.</dc:description>

By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope that this Minireview can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is a by now consolidated organocatalytic platform for a number of synthetic (asymmetric) transformations  via  diverse reaction modes/ intermediates. In addition to the typical  umpolung  processes involving acyl anion/homoenolate equivalent species, implementation of protocols under oxidative conditions greatly expands the possibilities of this methodology. Oxidative NHC&#8208;catalysis allows for oxidative and oxygenative transformations through specific manipulations of Breslow&#8208;type species depending upon the oxidant used (external oxidant or O  2  /air), the derived NHC&#8208;bound intermediates paving the way to non&#8208;  umpolung  processes through activation of carbon atoms and heteroatoms. This review is intended to update the state of the art in oxidative NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that appeared in the literature from 2014 to present, with a strong focus to crucial intermediates and their mechanistic implications.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the current greatest challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of time scales in complex environments, such as the cell.&#160; Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy coupled to Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels in reporting protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed by preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host cell,  Escherichia coli  . We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cells. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrostannylation of Red Phosphorus: A Convenient Route to Monophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable, industrially and academically relevant monophosphorus compounds are accessible directly from red phosphorus by using commonly available reagents. Only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques are needed, making this a convenient and practical methodology for the preparation of P1 compounds from elemental, red phosphorus.







Abstract
The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on indirect multistep procedures involving difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench&#8208;stable allotrope red phosphorus (Pred). The relatively inert Pred was productively functionalised by using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri&#8208;n&#8208;butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P1 compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive and commercially available, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.

         <title>Enabling Aromatic Hydroxylation in a Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzyme through Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biochemical data demonstrate that 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid binds within the active site of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP199A4, but no oxidation occurs. Protein engineering and molecular dynamic simulations establish that aromatic oxidation is enabled by a subtle shift of the substrate relative to the heme, thus improving our understanding of this important reaction.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of heme monooxygenases catalyse the selective oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions. The CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris catalyses aliphatic oxidation of 4&#8208;cyclohexylbenzoic acid but not the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid, due to the distinct mechanisms of aliphatic and aromatic oxidation. The aromatic substrates 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;, 4&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid and methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were assessed to see if they could achieve an orientation more amenable to aromatic oxidation. CYP199A4 could catalyse the efficient benzylic oxidation of 4&#8208;benzylbenzoic acid. The methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were oxidatively demethylated with low activity. However, no aromatic oxidation was observed with any of these substrates. Crystal structures of CYP199A4 with 4&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyphenyl)benzoic acid demonstrated that the substrate binding mode was like that of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. 4&#8208;Phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid bound with the ether or ketone oxygen atom hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the heme aqua ligand. We also investigated whether the substitution of phenylalanine residues in the active site could permit aromatic hydroxylation. Mutagenesis of the F298 residue to a valine did not significantly alter the substrate binding position or enable the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid; however the F182L mutant was able to catalyse 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid oxidation generating 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;, 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy metabolites in a 83&#8201;:&#8201;9&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the distance and angle of attack were considered, demonstrated that in the F182L variant, in contrast to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the phenyl ring of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid attained a productive geometry for aromatic oxidation to occur.

A benign and low&#8208;cost alternative for fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;sourced polymers, chitosan has tremendous potential because of its bioactivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. Synthetic pathways for chitosan derivatives with improved water solubility, and their associated applications, are explored. With the change in global direction towards a lower carbon economy and reduced environmental impact, fine&#8208;tuning chitosan properties is essential for a better future.







Abstract
Polymer alternatives sourced from nature have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among them, chitosan is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made in its synthetic modification by using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxy (&#8722;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8722;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remains limited and has hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This review summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan&#8216;s hydrophilicity and water solubility by using covalent modifications, namely amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also review several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, and water purification, and provide an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.

         <title>Magnetic Hyperthermia Enhancement in Iron&#8208;based Materials Driven by Carbon Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of both the thickness of the protective carbon layer, and the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles is driven by carbon support interactions. The iron hybrid materials (Fe3C@C/CNFAC) obtained from acid&#8208;treated carbon supports exhibit enhanced specific absorption rate values in biocompatible media.







Abstract
Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, they must be protected in order to overcome their toxicity and instability (i.&#8201;e., oxidation) under biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles, as well as the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8211;carbon interaction, mediated by the presence of oxygen&#8208;containing groups, induces the formation of small and well&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;based nanoparticles that exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate values.

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic chelates sometimes offer peripheral bonding for partially hydrolyzed multivalent cations clusters rather than their tight encapsulation inside the chelate &#8220;cage&#8221;. DOTA and DOTP chelates (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;(tetrayl)tetraacetic acid) and &#8208;(tetra(methylene phosphonic acid)), respectively) were used to study these chemical and structural motifs with the tetravalent cerium cation in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
The coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds were studied by using the ligands DOTA and DOTP (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of a highly ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements of the latter suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual decomposition in solution leads to the accumulation of the in&#8208;cage complexes [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in this study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the above&#8208;mentioned species, the in&#8208;cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the in&#8208;cage complexes studied herein and similar structures published previously suggests that hard&#8208;bonding cyclen&#8208;derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Imaging Assay of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein with Target&#8208;Induced Enzyme Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) is designed for sensitive and simple detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) based on a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR uses a proximity binding&#8208;induced RCA process to produce PPi and a PPi&#8208;mediated enzyme activity regulation process to retain HRP activity for signal generation. This CLIA is wash&#8208;free and can detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP down to 1&#8197;pg/mL (13&#8197;fM) with only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample.







Abstract
Simple but robust testing assays are essential for screening and diagnosis of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) in COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we described a chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) for sensitive and convenient detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR used a pair of antibody&#8208;DNA probes to recognize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP and proximity&#8208;induce rolling circle amplification for mass&#8208;production of pyrophosphate to coordinate with Cu2+, which prevented the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ by sodium ascorbate as well as the Cu+&#8208;caused inactivation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The activity retention of HRP produced strong CL signal for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by H2O2. The T&#8208;EAR based CLIA showed a wide detection range from 1&#8197;pg/mL to 100&#8197;ng/mL (13&#8197;fM to 1.3&#8197;nM) with the requirement of only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample. This CLIA had advantages of good sensitivity, simple wash&#8208;free operation, acceptable accuracy, and high&#8208;throughput imaging detection, displaying potential applicability in screening assay of COVID&#8208;19 infection.

         <title>Fabrication of Nb2O5/Carbon Submicrostructures for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb2O5/Carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by using a solvothermal method followed by a calcination process. As lithium ion batterie anodes, the Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance. The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity.







Abstract
Nb2O5 possesses superior fast Li+ storage capability for LIB anodes, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb2O5 restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb2O5/carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332&#8197;(194)&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;(5)&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb2O5/C submicrostructures with superior Li+ storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; possesses superior fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capability for LIB anodes, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332&#8197;(194)&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;(5)&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures, in which Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C composite can protect Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures with superior Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size Selectivity in Heterolanthanide Molecular Complexes with a Ditopic Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The similar reactivity of lanthanides generally leads to statistically populated polynuclear complexes, making the rational design of ordered hetero&#8208;lanthanide compounds extremely challenging. Here we report on the site selectivity&#160;in hetero&#8208;lanthanide tetranuclear complexes&#160;afforded by the relatively simple ditopic pyterpyNO ligand (4&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridil)&#8208;2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8221;&#8208;terpyridine  N  &#8208;oxide). The sequential room temperature reaction of RE  2  (tta)  6  (pyterpyNO)  2  (where RE= Y, (  1)  ; Eu, (  2)  , Dy, (  3)  Htta = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone) with La(tta)  3  dme (dme = dimethoxyethane) yielded Y  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  4  ), Dy  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  5  ) and Eu  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  6  ). Single crystals X&#8208;ray diffraction studies showed that  4, 5  and  6  are isostructural, featuring a tetranuclear structure with two different metal coordination sites with coordination numbers 8 (CN8) and 9 (CN9). The two smaller cations are mainly bridged by the  O  &#8208; donor atoms of the NO groups of two pyterpyNO ligands (CN8), while the larger lanthanum centres are bound by a terpyridine unit (CN9). Size selectivity has been studied with structural and magnetic studies in the solid state and through  19  F&#8208;NMR and photoluminescence studies in solution, showing a direct dependence on the difference of ionic radii of the ions and yielding a 91% selectivity for  4  . Furthermore,  19  F&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray and PL studies pointed out that the nature of the product is independent from the synthetic route for compound Eu  2  Y  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  7  ), keeping the ion selectivity also for a self&#8208;assembly reaction. Unexpectedly, these studies have evidenced that selectivity is not exclusively governed by electrostatic interactions related to size dimensions.</dc:description>

In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process has been extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines using various electrophiles to afford 25 examples with yields ranging from 42% to 97% with very short residence times.

         <title>Three&#8208;ligand Co&#8208;assembled 2D Au(I)&#8208;Thiolate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(I)&#8208;thiolate nanosheets with closely&#8208;packed multiple surface functional groups have been synthesized via a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;assembly strategy. The easy but powerful strategy addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Au(I)&#8208;thiolate assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which shows promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co&#8208;assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1&#8208;thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co&#8208;assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self&#8208;assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co&#8208;assembled by reacting with HAuCl4 together to obtain three&#8208;ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co&#8208;assembly are also revealed by comparing single&#8208; and three&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co&#8208;assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely&#8208;packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) Au(I)-thiolate assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which shows promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co-assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1-thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co-assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self-assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co-assembled by reacting with HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; together to obtain three-ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co-assembly are also revealed by comparing single- and three-ligand self-assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co-assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely-packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Au(I) Alkynyl Emitters: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new alkynyl Au(I) carbene complex with tunable electronic structure shows high efficiency thermally activated fluorescence (TADF). Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs made with these complexes achieve high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 20.4&#8201;%, manifesting the bright prospect of Au(I)&#8208;TADF emitters in OLEDs.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type coinage metal complexes displaying efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been unveiled to be highly appealing candidates as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein a series of green to yellow TADF gold(I) complexes with alkynyl ligands has been developed for the first time. The complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 0.76 in doped films (5&#8197;wt&#8201;% in PMMA) at room temperature. The modifications of alkynyl ligands with electron&#8208;donating amino groups together with the use of electron&#8208;deficient carbene ligands induce ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states that give rise to TADF emission. Spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the roles of electron&#8208;donating capability of the alkynyl ligand in tuning the excited&#8208;state properties. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the present complexes as emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#8901;x&#8201;H2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radioactive Tc in deep nuclear waste repositories can be immobilized by reduction of the highly soluble TcO4&#8722; anion by agents like magnetite (Fe3O4) and H2, which create an amorphous TcO2&#8901;x&#8201;H2O precipitate. EXAFS measurements combined with DFT calculations reveal that the precipitate is an inorganic polymer formed of zigzag TcO2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O chains and give evidence of an increasing polymerization over time. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;F. Oliveira, A.&#8197;C. Scheinost, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202235).

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules have found a plethora of important applications in many research fields. Consequently, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of these unique skeletons have drawn a lot of research interests and achieved notable advances in the last two decades. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the progresses in this field, including methods enabled by both asymmetric transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules, usually containing multiple ortho&#8208;fused aromatic rings, possess unique helical chirality. These compounds have found a wide range of important applications in many research fields, such as asymmetric catalysis, molecular recognition, sensors and responsive switches, circularly polarized luminescence materials and others. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes was largely underexplored, when compared with the enantioselective synthesis of molecules bearing other stereogenic elements (e.g. central chirality and axial chirality). Since the pioneer work of asymmetric synthesis of helicenes via enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triynes by Star&#225; and Star&#253;, last two decades have witnessed the tremendous development in the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the advances in this field, which include methods enabled by both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis, and provide our perspective on its future development.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Carbon Dots in Bi&#8208;Solvent Systems Triggered by Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in bi&#8208;solvent systems has been demonstrated as an unprecedented strategy to realize circularly polarized luminescence of achiral carbon dots. Dissymmetry factors of 10&#8722;3 are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality.







Abstract
An innovative strategy for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of carbon dots (CDs) has been developed: The achiral CDs displayed contrary supramolecular chirality and opposite CPL in two different bi&#8208;solvent systems, which are due to the formation of self&#8208;assembled helical nanostructures with two diverse assembly modes (P and M) in aggregate state via intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and differential hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) without the need of any additional element of chirality.

         <title>A Symmetrically &#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazole Incorporating Fluoranthene Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building big. A symmetrically &#960;&#8208;expanded carbazole incorporating fluoranthene moieties was assembled through a five&#8208;step synthetic route. In comparison to parent N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted carbazole the compound features significantly bathochromically shifted UV&#8208;Vis absorption and emission maxima with considerably increased photoluminescence quantum yield. The &#960;&#8208;expansion results in facilitated oxidation with improved reversibility, while at the same time, the aromaticity of the central carbazole moiety remains unaffected.







Abstract
A novel doubly cyclopentannulated carbazole which is accessible through a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of di(1&#8208;naphthylamine) is disclosed. The carbazole moiety is generated in the final step through intramolecular oxidative coupling. The &#960;&#8208;expansion of carbazole resulted in strongly altered optoelectronic and electrochemical properties. The solid&#8208;state structure features an interesting packing motif with alternating face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Switching Chirophilic Self&#8208;assembly: From meso&#8208;structures to Conglomerates in Liquid and Liquid Crystalline Network Phases of Achiral Polycatenar Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of the interhelical self&#8208;assembly from enantiophilic to enantiophobic takes place by reduction of the alkyl chain length and leads to a phase transition from the achiral double gyroid via a tetragonal phase to a chiral triple network phase, associated with a transition from an achiral to a mirror symmetry broken liquid.







Abstract
Spontaneous generation of chirality from achiral molecules is a contemporary research topic with numerous implications for technological applications and for the understanding of the development of homogeneous chirality in biosystems. Herein, a series of azobenzene based rod&#8208;like molecules with an 3,4,5&#8208;trialkylated end and a single n&#8208;alkyl chain involving 5 to 20 aliphatic carbons at the opposite end is reported. Depending on the chain length and temperature these achiral molecules self&#8208;assemble into a series of liquid and liquid crystalline (LC) helical network phases. A chiral isotropic liquid (Iso1[*]) and a cubic triple network phase with chiral I23 lattice were found for the short chain compounds, whereas non&#8208;cubic and achiral cubic phases dominate for the long chain compounds. Among them a mesoscale conglomerate with I23 lattice, a tetragonal phase (Tetbi) containing one chirality synchronized and one non&#8208;synchronized achiral network, an achiral double network meso&#8208;structure with Ia
d space group and an achiral percolated isotropic liquid mesophase (Iso1) were found. This sequence is attributed to an increasing strength of chirality synchronization between the networks, combined with a change of the preferred mode of chirophilic self&#8208;assembly between the networks, switching from enantiophilic to enantiophobic with decreasing chain length and lowering temperature. These nanostructured and mirror symmetry broken LC phases exist over wide temperature ranges which is of interest for potential applications in chiral and photosensitive functional materials derived from achiral compounds.

         <title>A Versatile Palladium Synthon: [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)]

Low coordination number yet stable: The synthesis and characterisation of new low&#8208;valent palladium (0) complexes are reported, and provide simple access to known and novel complexes, the instrinsic reactivity of which prevented their isolation using existing methods. One complex performs exceptionally well as a catalyst in the hydrosilylation reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)] complexes are reported. These new 14&#8208;electron Pd(0)&#8208;complexes are key synthons leading to known palladium(0) and palladium(II) species, as well as permitting access to unprecedented mixed NHC&#8208;phosphite palladium(0) complexes. This motif permits the facile catalytic hydrosilylation of allenes. DFT calculations have allowed the characterization of the relatively weak interaction between the metal and the diphenylacetylene ligand, with a comparison with a series of ligands with more or less coordinating power, bearing varied structural and electronic properties.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Catalytic Photooxidations by Using Solvent as a Sacrificial Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New way to drive photoredox catalysis: Highly chemoselective photooxidations of benzylic alcohols to carbonyl compounds in the presence of various easily&#8208;oxidizable groups are possible in a simple oxygen&#8208;free system consisting of a substrate, unique deazaflavinium catalyst and acetonitrile which acts simultaneously as a sacrificial electron acceptor and solvent.







Abstract
Catalyst recovery is an integral part of photoredox catalysis. It is often solved by adding another component&#8208;a sacrificial agent&#8208;whose role is to convert the catalyst back into its original oxidation state. However, an additive may cause a side reaction thus decreasing the selectivity and overall efficiency. Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent&#8208;acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, and on anaerobic conditions. This is allowed by the unique properties of the catalyst, 7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaflavinium chloride existing in both strongly oxidizing and reducing forms, whose strength is increased by excitation with visible light. Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over&#8208;oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70&#8201;%. 4&#8208;Substituted 1&#8208;phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80&#8211;100&#8201;% and, moreover, with yields 31&#8208;98&#8201;% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system. Mechanistic studies based on UV&#8208;Vis spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements showed that the process involving an electron release from an excited deazaflavin radical to acetonitrile under formation of solvated electron is crucial for the catalyst recovery.

The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building&#8208;blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of an exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF).

Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metal&#8208;peptide frameworks.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards ultrasensitive SERS analysis: Magneto&#8208;plasmonic dendrimer&#8208;based colloids have been explored for the adsorption and SERS detection of contaminants in water quality monitoring assisted by magnetic separation. Three chemical routes &#8211; crosslinking, chemical grafting, and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly &#8211; led to hybrid nanostructures with distinct potentialities.







Abstract
Chemical analyses in the field using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocols are expected to be part of several analytical procedures applied to water quality monitoring. To date, these endeavors have been supported by developments in SERS substrate nanofabrication, instrumentation portability, and the internet of things. Here, we report distinct chemical strategies for preparing magneto&#8208;plasmonic (Fe3O4&#8201;:&#8201;Au) colloids, which are relevant in the context of trace&#8208;level detection of water contaminants due to their inherent multifunctionality. The main objective of this research is to investigate the role of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAMs) in the preparation of SERS substrates integrating both functionalities into single nanostructures. Three chemical routes were investigated to design magneto&#8208;plasmonic nanostructures that translate into different ways for assessing SERS detection by using distinct interfaces. Hence, a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic colloids have been characterized and then assessed for their SERS activity by using a model pesticide (thiram) dissolved in aqueous samples.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8211;air batteries: The development of TMS catalysts and their applications in ZABs is discussed. We focus on the means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of TMS, such as defect introduction, interface engineering, and structural regulation. Finally, some challenges and opportunities in TMS electrocatalysis research are briefly presented, and strategies for improving the performance of ZABs are prospected.







Abstract
Go electro! The means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of transition&#8208;metal sulfides (TMS) and ideas for the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts, including structure engineering, interface engineering, defect engineering, etc&#8222; are discussed in this work. In addition, the performance improvement law between catalyst performance and ZABs and the development direction and prospects of designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts based on TMS are also discussed.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate Dissolution from the Laboratory to the Ocean: Kinetics and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate chemistry: Although calcite dissolution has been extensively studied there appears to be a problem; apparent contradictions, discrepancies between laboratories and inconsistencies with field measurements seemingly pervade the literature. This review highlights how &#8211; in some circumstances &#8211; a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hindered development.







Abstract
The ultimate fate, over the course of millennia, of nearly all of the carbon dioxide formed by humankind is for it to react with calcium carbonate in the world's oceans. Although, this reaction is of global relevance, aspects of the calcite dissolution reaction remain poorly described with apparent contradictions present throughout the expansive literature. In this perspective we aim to evidence how a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hampered developments in this area. These insights have important implications for both idealised experiments performed under laboratory conditions and for the measurement and modelling of oceanic calcite sediment dissolution.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios and fast spin relaxation complicate their observations. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201490), R.&#8197;P. Martinho and L. Frydman explore indirect ways for detecting these sites with the help of proton detection, amplified by chemical exchanges with the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications are mediated by spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons, opening new avenues in spectroscopic MRI.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Epoxy/Surface Adhesion: Understanding the Interphase Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy resin coatings are commonly used to protect metal surfaces from corrosion. Molecular simulations are used to investigate the adhesion in an epoxy resin precursor to hematite and goethite surfaces, as a proxy for steel surfaces and the effect of water ingress. For hematite water always decreases the adhesion whilst for goethite a small amount of water increases adhesion to the surface.







Abstract
Epoxy resins coatings are commonly found in corrosion protection coatings but the presence of water can affect their adhesion to the substrate, often weakening the adhesion of the coating to the solid, reducing its efficiency. Nevertheless, small amounts of water can enhance the epoxy/substrate interactions. In this work, the interphase region of an epoxy precursor and metal oxide substrates is investigated using molecular simulations and it is found that water accumulates between the epoxy layer and the solid substrate. At high water concentrations (9&#8197;wt&#8201;%) the interaction between the epoxy precursor and the solid surface is weakened regardless of the nature of the solid, but at low water concentrations the nature of the solid surface becomes important. For hematite, the presence of water decreases the strength of adhesion but for goethite the presence of a small amount of water (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) enhances the adhesion to the surface resulting in a densification at the interface.
