         <title>Expanded Structural Design of Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals Based on&#160;Linear Tris&#8208;Pyrrolidinium Salt</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter&#8208;anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (11&#8208;PF6) exhibited two solid&#8208;solid phase transitions, and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 210 &#176;C. Similarly, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (12&#8208;PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &#916;Sfof 18 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 206 &#176;C. The temperature&#8208;dependent soft crystalline phases of 11&#8208;PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11&#8208;PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#215;10&#8208;6 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 at 70 &#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#215;10&#8208;4 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11&#8208;PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4 V (vs. Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;voltage electrolyte component.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis and Isolation of Unimolecular Oligo[n]catenanes Using a One&#8208;Pot CuAAC &#8220;Click&#8221; Reaction Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain&#8208;like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that distinguish them from traditional molecular architectures; making catenanes attractive building blocks in the construction of next&#8208;generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [n]catenanes are either low yielding or rely on multi&#8208;step pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [n]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template&#8208;directed one&#8208;pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline&#8208;based precursors and CuAAC &#8216;click&#8217; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [n]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)&#8208;mediated templation and click chemistry, ultimately producing either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well&#8208;defined linear [2]&#8208;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the azide&#8208; and alkyne&#8208;functionalized precursors (slow versus rapid addition). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway towards the preparation of higher order [n]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Dextran&#8208;Assisted Biomimetic Fabrication of CdSe:Eu QDs with Enhanced Biocompatibility and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dextran templated biomimetic synthetic approach was applied for the preparation of CdSe:Eu QDs. The present work examines synthetic variables including the effect of increasing Europium concentration during QDs&#8217; synthesis and the use of different coating agents (citrate versus APTES) to improve the QDs' colloidal stability and ameliorate their cytotoxic behaviour. All samples were subjected to structural and morphological characterizations via Fourier Transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, UV&#8211;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Subsequently, biological evaluation of all the synthesized samples of bare and APTES coated CdSe:Eu QDs was conducted on epithelial HaCaT and breast cancer MCF&#8208;7. The effect of the samples on cellular proliferation and migration was assessed through the wound healing assay. Finally, cellular localization of QDs was examined by fluorescence microscopy by exploiting their inherent fluorescent capability after excitation, thus validating their potential for cellular imaging and theragnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated ammonia capture and exchange on ion&#8208;exchanged 4A zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. In fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of a reactive species. Identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND3&#8594;NH3). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work we present the development of ion&#8208;exchanged A&#8208;type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. Thus, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A&#8208;type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND3 and NH3, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND3 from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.</dc:description>

         <title>From C&#9472;H Bond Insertion to Hydrogen Atom Transfer: Tuning the Reaction Mechanisms of Methane Activation by the Oxidation of Ta2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and theoretical study, it is observed that the continued oxidation from Ta2+ to Ta2Ox+ (with x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 6) changes the reactivity with methane from a typical metallic to a typical oxidic behavior. While the bridging motifs in Ta2O2+ enable the dehydrogenation of CH4, the spin density on oxygen atoms in Ta2O5+ facilitates a HAT reaction.








Abstract
The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal; the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta2+ compounds exposed to methane in a ring&#8208;electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound's degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta2+ to Ta2O6+ based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta2O2+ and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta2O5+, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8211;C&#8211;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta2O2+; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.

&lt;p&gt;In a combined experimental and theoretical study, it is observed that the continued oxidation from Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 6) changes the reactivity with methane from a typical metallic to a typical oxidic behavior. While the bridging motifs in Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; enable the dehydrogenation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the spin density on oxygen atoms in Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates a HAT reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal; the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; compounds exposed to methane in a ring-electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound's degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8211;C&#8211;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combination of Arsines and Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane Toward Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the reactivity of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs, which had not been explored previously. Using tertiary arsines with different steric and electronic properties, the formation of classical Lewis adducts, FLP&#8208;type encounter complexes, and arsonium borate adducts with B(C6F5)3 was demonstrated. Their reactivity toward small molecules and detailed structural characterization were also reported.








Abstract
Various combinations of Lewis acids and bases, particularly frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), have been investigated for their distinctive reactivities. Nevertheless, to date, no systematic study of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs has been reported. In this study, tertiary arsines with different degrees of steric hindrance and electron&#8208;donating abilities were used. Depending on their steric and electronic properties, arsines form classical Lewis adducts, FLPs, or arsonium borate adducts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3). Experimental and computational analyzes revealed that trimesitylarsine and B(C6F5)3 form an encounter complex in solution, which is referred to as an FLP adduct. Furthermore, the arsine&#8211;borane pairs react with phenylacetylene and diphenyl disulfide to afford the corresponding arsonium borate adduct and thioarsonium thioborate salt, respectively. The structures of the products were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Oxidative Thiolated Aromatization of Terpenes for Divergent Construction of Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent and divergent strategy has been developed for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes with different oxidation states. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community pursuing the transformation of terpenes and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Synthetic transformation of terpenoids represents a long&#8208;standing research topic in organic synthesis. Due to the presence of multiple oxidation states and isomers in naturally abundant terpenoids, their separation and efficient utilization pose challenges. Convergent transformations of various terpenes can circumvent these issues. We herein developed a convergent and divergent strategy for control of oxidation states, enabling the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes. This protocol features broad substrate scope, good functional compatibility, and high redox&#8208;selectivity. Convergent synthesis strategy was implemented smoothly by using drug and plant extracts. The synthesis of sulfoxide and sulfone products was further achieved by modulating the oxidation conditions, respectively. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>QM/MM Unlocks The Catalytic Mechanism of YtfE: The Structural Reorganization of The Active Site Enables Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM simulations reveal that the structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for the reductive cleavage of the N&#9472;O bond and NO formation in the nonheme diiron YtfE. This mechanistic insight advances understanding of nitrite reduction in nonheme diiron oxygenases and their biological roles.








Abstract
Escherichia coli (E. coli) repair of iron center protein (also known as YtfE) is a nonheme diiron protein that plays a pivotal role in bacterial responses to nitrosative stress, particularly in nitrite reduction and nitric oxide metabolism. Although previous studies have explored its potential as a nitrite reductase, the detailed catalytic mechanism, especially the role of its diiron center in nitrite reduction, remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiscale computational approaches, including quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics metadynamics (QM/MM MD), and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of nitrite reduction by YtfE. Our findings reveal that structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for modulating the nitrite reduction mechanism. This work provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of YtfE, offering a theoretical foundation for understanding its role in bacterial stress responses and potential applications in synthetic biology and environmental remediation.

         <title>Realizing the Capacity Benefit of Anionic Redox in Stoichiometric Sodium Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully harnessing the capacity benefit of anionic redox reactions requires Na&#8208;stoichiometric compounds with 3d TMs. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked the first step, which delivers decent capacity with no voltage decay. We provide strategies such as designing chemical composition, multiphase structure, and ordering superstructure to further improve the energy density with anionic redox without sacrificing kinetics and energy efficiency






.

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries offer a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet their lower energy density remains a challenge. Anionic redox in layered oxide cathodes has the potential to enhance capacity beyond the limits of transition&#8208;metal redox. This potential is maximized in full&#8208;stoichiometric sodium compounds with 3d transition metals, a goal hindered by synthesis challenges. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked a breakthrough, offering high capacity, moisture stability, and no voltage decay. Yet, issues such as irreversibility, voltage hysteresis, and slow kinetics remain. In this concept, we review the state of the art of this promising O3 phase with a brief account of other anionic&#8208;redox&#8208;based Na compounds. We then discuss strategies and prospects to address these challenges, including tuning chemical compositions, O/P multiphase structures, and superstructure ordering.

Supercapacitor Electrode: Litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres loaded on MOF&#8208;derived carbon layers for enhancing the electrochemical performance of ASCs.








Abstract
Developing ideal positive electrodes with excellent performance and structural stability for supercapacitors is crucial in enhancing the application potential. Herein, we successfully fabricate a composite structure of NiMoP2@C on nickel foam (NF) (NMP@C/NF), which is formed by loading a litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres onto MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer with the two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. The carbon layer acts as a structurally stable framework, and its synergistic effect with active materials suppresses volume expansion while enhancing electron transport efficiency. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface between crystalline/amorphous phases optimizes redox reaction kinetics, and the unique morphology composed of multi&#8208;scale components increases the accessible surface area for redox reactions. As a result, the NMP@C/NF obtains a high specific capacitance of 2224.8 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.97% after 8000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NMP@C/NF positive electrode and active carbon negative electrode generates an energy density of 52.52&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 784.55&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance retention rate reaches up to 78% after 8000 cycles. This study provides promising pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly positive electrodes for supercapacitors.

         <title>Differentiating Ligand Tailoring and Cation Incorporation as Strategies for Tuning Heterobimetallic Cerium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of ligand structure and incorporation of secondary Lewis acidic cations on high coordination number cerium centers have been studied, revealing unique roles for ligands and secondary cations in driving structural and electronic tunability. Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes by secondary cations is an important strategy commonly applied to low coordination number metal centers but one that is underexplored for heavier metals like lanthanides (including cerium) and actinides.








Abstract
Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes featuring metals with high coordination numbers by incorporation of secondary redox&#8208;inactive cations has received far less attention than it deserves. Here, appending moderate steric bulk to a tripodal ligand framework has been tested for its influence on secondary&#8208;cation&#8208;driven structural and electrochemical tuning of cerium, a lanthanide that tends to adopt high coordination numbers. A quasi&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric cerium(III) complex denoted [Ce] has been prepared that features pendant benzyloxy groups, and this work demonstrates that this species offers a site capable of binding single Na+ or Ca2+ ions. Electrochemical and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies reveal equilibrium binding affinity of [Ce] for Na+ in acetonitrile solvent, contrasting with tight binding of all cations in all other previously studied systems of this type. The modulated cation binding can be attributed to the bulky benzyloxy groups, which impact the thermodynamics of cation binding but do not impede the formation of cerium centers with coordination number 8 upon binding of either Na+ or Ca2+. The Ce(IV/III) reduction potential was found to be tunable under the equilibrium binding conditions, highlighting the potentially significant role that controlled structural changes can play in modulating the solution properties of heterobimetallic complexes.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Two Fucosylated Human Milk Oligosaccharides: 3&#8208;Fucosyllactose and Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V</title>

         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Fucosyllactose human milk oligosaccharide was produced using a reliable chemical synthesis approach. Also reported is the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V human milk oligosaccharide. The approach for the synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V comprised a convergent&#160;2 + 3 assembly strategy, making use of a trisaccharide building block derived from 3&#8208;fucosyllactose.








Abstract
Glycans present in human milk have been the focus of many studies due to challenges associated with their synthesis. The development of new methods for obtaining individual glycans found in human milk has been a vibrant area of research in glycosciences. This study reports the synthesis of two fucosylated glycans found in human milk, 3&#8208;fucosyllactose, which was previously synthesized by both chemical and enzymatic methods, and the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V. Screening different protecting and leaving groups, as well as optimizing the glycosylation reaction conditions helped us to achieve efficient assembly and deprotection of these two fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides in good yields.

         <title>Click Conjugates of Artificial Ribonucleases: Sequence Specific Cleavage with Multiple Turnover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trisbenzimidazole catalyst was attached to central positions of DNA and DNA&#8208;LNA oligonucleotides. The resulting conjugates bind complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple turnover and substrate half&#8208;lives down to 3.5&#160;hours. Up to 98.8% of cleavage occurs in a single site. The reaction does not depend on metal ions and also runs in the presence of EDTA.








Abstract
The azido modified RNA cleaving catalyst 2 has been attached to oligonucleotides containing alkyne linkers in a central position. The resulting conjugates hybridize specifically with complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple substrate turnover. RNA half&#8208;lives are in the range of 6&#8211;7&#160;hours (pH 8, 37 &#176;C). Some well&#8208;placed locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides can further increase substrate affinities and reaction rates significantly (t&#189; of 3.5&#160;hours, kobs&#160;=&#160;0.20 h&#8722;1). RNA cleavage does not require metal ions and runs equally well in the presence of EDTA. Fragments of precisely defined lengths are formed, well suited for subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry and related bioanalytical techniques.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a novel strategy for the first time: bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums were used as the robust and versatile coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents. Fast reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with carboxylic acids or phosphodiesters formed carboxylic acid&#8208;sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides and phosphosulfonic acid mixed anhydrides, respectively, and the subsequent treatments of the highly active intermediates with the corresponding nucleophilic partners in the presence of imidazoles at room temperature provided amides, dipeptides, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters (almost without racemization during the formation of amides, dipeptides, esters, thioesters), phosphamides and phosphoesters in high to excellent yields. This kind of Nsulfonyl imidazolium as the coupling reagent was successfully applied in solid phase synthesis of a polypeptide containing 32 amino acid residues. This strategy was effectively extended to the construction of glycosides, and high steroselectivity and good yields were provided. In addition, reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with amines or alcohols afforded the corresponding sulfonamides and sulfonates in excellent yields. This study should provide a highly efficient, economical and practical strategy for construction of diverse molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new dinuclear complexes [CuCl(o&#8208;van&#8208;en)Ln(H2O)3 Cl]Cl&#183;C2H6O (Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3); H2(o&#8208;van&#8208;en) is the Schiff base formed by 2/1 condensation of o&#8208;vanillin and ethylenediamine) were prepared in single crystal form by the method of horizontal diffusion. The prepared complexes were characterized by chemical analyses and IR spectroscopy.

         <title>Pt&#8208;Decorated NiMo/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Hydrogen Evolution: Synergistic Electronic Modulation and Industrial Application Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) through a solvent evaporation and high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method, which shows excellent performance in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotentials, high stability, and great potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis and energy conversion applications.








Abstract
In response to the urgent demand for sustainable hydrogen production under industrial high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions, this study presents the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst was synthesized via a solvent evaporation method followed by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, achieving uniform dispersion of Pt&#8208;NiMo nanoparticles on conductive carbon. Electrochemical evaluations revealed exceptional HER performance with ultralow overpotentials of 20 and 170&#160;mV versus RHE at current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The Pt&#8208;NiMo catalyst demonstrated robust stability over 120 hours at 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, attributed to its hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic interactions between Pt and NiMo. The MEA configuration showcased stable electrochemical performance with a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at a cell voltage of 1.53&#160;V versus RHE, highlighting its potential for efficient energy conversion applications such as water electrolysis or fuel cells. These results underscore the catalyst's potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis, offering a cost&#8208;effective and durable solution for green hydrogen production.

         <title>Direct Transformation of Bio&#8208;Based Furfural into &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over SO3H&#8208;Functionalized P&#9472;O&#9472;Hf Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalyst GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was constructed to be highly efficient for the direct upgrading of furfural (FF) to &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) in a high yield of 71%, involving multiple reaction steps, mainly attributed to an appropriate amount/distribution of Lewis acid&#8208;base (Hf4+&#8208;O2&#8722;) and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites and favorable texture structure. Moreover, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was highly recyclable with intact multi&#8208;functional motifs.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) has great application potential in organic synthesis and biofuels, while its high&#8208;efficiency production from easily available bio&#8208;based feedstock is challenging. In this work, SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalysts GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) were facilely prepared by solvothermal treatment of glucose&#8208;containing organic precursors (GPC) and Hf4+ in a mass ratio of n:m. The acid strength and Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid sites of GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) could be modulated by tuning the GPC/Hf4+ ratio. Among them, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) with appropriate acid&#8208;base properties delivered prominent catalytic activity in the direct upgrading of a bio&#8208;based bulk chemical furfural (FF) to GVL with a good yield of 71%, as optimized by response surface methodology. Especially, the suitable distribution of Lewis acid (Hf4+), Lewis base (O2&#8722;), and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites played a synergistic role in cascade transfer hydrogenation, furan ring opening, second hydrogenation, and lactonization. Moreover, the GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) catalyst was unveiled to have a uniform elemental dispersion, relatively large specific surface area, and amorphous structure, which might also contribute to its superior efficiency. Recycling experiments showed that GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) could be reused at least six&#160;times with almost no decline in activity. The overall bio&#8208;derived catalytic conversion system offers a more sustainable manner for biomass valorization.

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugate Triggered Red Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Single Benzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, single benzene derivatives, which are uniquely different from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, display red/NIR RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture minimizes the requirement for red/NIR phosphors to a single benzene ring.








Abstract
Benzene is the simplest and the most basic building block for the construction of &#960; conjugated systems, which are widely used in various fields from fluorescent (FL) dyes to optoelectronic displays. However, achieving the red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from single benzene is still challenging. Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, herein, we report a single benzene&#8208;based push&#8208;pull system with red RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture is uniquely separate from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and minimizes the requirement for red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors to a single benzene ring.

         <title>Photocatalysis Enables Chemodivergent Radical Polar Crossover: Ritter&#8208;Type Amidation vs Heck&#8208;Type Olefin Carbofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One aryl makes the difference: switching styrenes with 1,1&#8208;diaryl olefins as radical acceptors, the benzylic cation intermediate fate changes from Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation to Heck&#8208;type reaction. The decarboxylative photocatalytic chemodivergent methodology enabled broad scope and efficient scalability in both batch and flow. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrated both radical generation pathways and the origin of product switchability. 








Abstract
Three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization reactions constitute an ideal platform to rapidly build molecular complexity, enabling the simultaneous introduction of two distinct, orthogonal functional groups into the C&#9552;C bond in a single step. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation of electronically diverse styrenes harnessing non&#8208;stabilized, nucleophilic primary radicals generated from readily&#8208;accessible carboxylic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters is reported. Furthermore, it is found that Heck&#8208;type products are chemoselectively obtained by simply switching aryl olefin acceptors with 1,1&#8208;diarylolefins. In the context of photocatalytic chemodivergent radical polar crossover, the synthesis of various trisubstituted alkenes was achieved, simultaneously revealing a divergence in the activation of redox&#8208;active esters toward reduction. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies demonstrated both transformation pathways, while DFT calculations indicated the origin of product switchability. Both Ritter&#8208;type and Heck&#8208;type olefin carbofunctionalizations are scalable up to 4&#160;mmol scale in batch and continuous flow, proving the synthetic utility of the methodology.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Triterpenoid Saponins Inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;Mediated Transfer of HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>

         <dc:description>
The convergent synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins (1 and 2) is presented. The synthetic saponins were shown to inhibit, at the low micromolar range, the DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, whereas free Lewis&#8208;X, aglycones, and structurally similar triterpenoid saponins lacking the fucose residue were not.








Abstract
Blocking dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin (DC&#8208;SIGN)&#8208; and liver/lymph node&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing integrin (L&#8208;SIGN)&#8208;mediated human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV&#8208;1) attachment to immune cells represents a promising strategy for developing antiretroviral agents effective during the early stages of sexual transmission. Although mannose&#8208; and fucose&#8208;based ligands have received considerable attention, Lewis&#8208;based inhibitors remain relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins featuring betulinic acid and echinocystic acid as aglycones. These saponins were stereoselectively and efficiently synthesized in six linear steps using a convergent approach that leveraged thioglycoside and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation chemistries. Notably, our findings demonstrate that these Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins are among the most potent monovalent inhibitors reported to date of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, with IC50&#160;values in the low micromolar range (21&#8211;50 &#181;M). This work lays a valuable foundation for the development of saponin&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting immune cells.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Keto Esters into &#945;&#8208;Arylated &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Using Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemoselective nucleophilic addition of aryllithium reagents to the keto&#8208;carbonyl moiety in &#945;&#8208;keto esters as ambident carbonyl electrophiles has been achieved by using flash continuous&#8208;flow system that has overcome the problems in the conventional batch reaction system. One or multiple competitive ester moieties remained intact despite the high reactivities of aryllithium reagents including the short&#8208;lived functionalized species that cannot survive in the batch reaction system. 








Abstract
This research explores the selective reactions of organolithium reagents with &#945;&#8208;keto esters using a flow microreactor system. The study highlights the influence of precise temperature control and rapid mixing on enhancing reaction yield and selectivity. By optimizing conditions for aryllithium reagents bearing electrophilic functional groups and &#945;&#8208;keto esters, the system demonstrated superior performance over traditional batch methods. This method efficiently minimized byproduct formation, providing high yields and excellent selectivity for sterically hindered substrates. The flow microreactor thus offers an innovative platform for complex organometallic transformations.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Oxidation of Alkanes and Postfunctionalization of Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of polyolefin elastomer (POE) was achieved through the activation of C&#9472;H bonds in the polymer backbone using a cobalt catalyst and cumene hydroperoxide as an oxidant. This transformation enabled the introduction of polar functional groups, including alcohol, ketone, and ester moieties, into the POE structure.








Abstract
This study focuses on the postfunctionalization of polyolefin elastomers (POEs) through direct C&#9472;H activation using a novel cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The investigation, initiated with the oxidation of cyclohexane, identified the cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO) as the optimal oxidant and ligands L3, L4, and L7 as effective in chlorinated benzene solvents. Cobalt catalyst (Cat. 1) demonstrated superior activity in the oxidation of octadecane, achieving a 42% yield with a minimal amount of catalyst. The catalytic system was successfully extended to the C&#9472;H oxidation of POE, introducing functional groups in solvents like 1,2&#8208;Cl2C6H4 and 1,2,4&#8208;Cl3C6H3. Our findings propose a simple and green approach for the postfunctionalization of POE, offering versatility and potential for broader applications in the field of polymeric compounds.

         <title>Minisci Reaction by an MW&#8208;Boost: A Simple Protocol for Site&#8208;Selective Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Nitrogen&#8208;Aromatics and C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
The Minisci&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reaction between C&#9472;(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics proceeded successfully using a simple protocol based on MW (microwave) irradiation with a persulfate anion. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics, in which the site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by a HAT transition state with a sulfate radical. The MW/persulfate protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered ring fused lutidine derivatives.








Abstract
The Minisci&#8208;type reaction between C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics was carried out using a simple protocol based on the persulfate anion (PS) under microwave (MW) irradiation. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of N&#8208;heteroaromatics and C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics. Site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the sulfate radical affecting the polar/steric effects in the transition state. The MW/PS protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered rings fused by pyridine and lutidine, which, in previous methods, it was necessary to use tedious derivatization to imino&#8208;oxyacetic acids as HAT precursors.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical synthesis has emerged as a powerful and more sustainable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based methods, offering advantages such as no or only minimal solvent use, reduced reaction times, and simplified operational conditions. The integration of multiple steps into a single reaction vessel further enhances these benefits by eliminating workup and purification steps, reducing waste, and often improving overall efficiency. This review highlights recent advancements in mechanochemical one&#8208;pot multistep reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on protocols with sequential one&#8208;pot operation. Diverse transformations are covered, including heterocycle formation, functional group interconversions, and the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, while discussing both the operational and environmental advantages of these methodologies, along with their remaining challenges. Overall, mechanochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis has the potential to streamline transformations and therefore contribute to more sustainable approaches in modern organic synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Process for Preparing Metal&#8208;organic Framework Composites based on Carbon&#8208;based Quantum Dots and their Derivatives as Drug Delivery Systems for Andrographolide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Andrographolide (ADG) was conjugated with MIL&#8208;53(Al), ZIF&#8208;8, carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (CBQDs) and doped carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (D&#8208;CBQDs) using high&#8208;pressure (0.3 GPa) contact. This solvent&#8208;free approach is environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient and time&#8208;saving, resulting in ADG&#8208;MOFs&#8208;CBQDs/D&#8208;CBQDs with physical properties comparable to those produced by traditional liquid phase encapsulation. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, XRD, TGA, FT&#8208;IR and 1H NMR. The results indicate that ADG was partly encapsulated within the MOF pores, while another portion was bound externally to CBQD/D&#8208;CBQDs, as evidenced by distinct drug signals in each analysis. This green synthesis approach simplifies the conjugation process. It significantly enhances the drug solubility, as indicated by changes in hydrophobicity observed via 1H NMR, surpassing the improvements achieved by ADG encapsulation within MOFs alone. Additionally, in preliminary tests, the materials exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PC3 cells compared to ADG (25.05 &#177; 0.06 &#181;g/mL) after 48 h of exposure.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Exploration of Stereoelectronic Relationships in Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoelectronic effects governing Mn&#8208;catalysed hydrogenation reactions have been deconvoluted through the analysis of a series of in silico catalyst modifications using DFT (PBE0&#8208;D3PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;TZVP//RI&#8208;BP86PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;SVP level of theory). Computations were performed on the Mn&#8208;catalysed reduction of indanone based on a catalyst from the Clarke group, consisting of a tridentate ligand with pyridine, amine and phosphine donors and a ferrocenyl linker in the backbone. Enantioselectivity enhancements were found through two pathways; firstly, with the stabilisation of aromatic substrates by means of an extended &#960;&#8208;system, enhancing &#960;&#8208;stacking non&#8208;covalent interactions; secondly, by the introduction of steric bulk around the active site to destabilise one of the diastereomeric hydride transfer transition states. Electronic effects were differentiated from sterics by modification of the phenyl groups at the phosphine, trans&#8208; to the metal&#8208;hydride bond. While electron&#8208;withdrawing groups increased the thermodynamic driving force, the highest activity is predicted with electron&#8208;donating groups due to the improved basicity of the nitrogen lone pair, required for the initiation of hydrogen activation. Based on these observations, promising routes for synthetic catalyst design may involve donating groups which improve activity, coupled with enantiodiscrimination via steric bulk as a more general strategy than being limited to &#960;&#8208;containing substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodynamism in chiral polyaromatic phosphepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present experimental&#8208;computational study, we demonstrate that the stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoid can be used to afford diastereoisomers of polyaromatics fused with a chiral phosphepine (7&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring). In particular, we highlight a complex interplay between the inversion at the P centre and helicenoid epimerization as well as a competition with a re&#8208;aromatization reaction. The impact of the conformational modifications on the structure and the chiroptical properties including circularly polarized luminescence are also discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of Hypermodified DNA Displaying a Combination of Thiol, Hydroxyl, Carboxylate and Imidazole Functional Groups in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized a set of six 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates (dNTPs) bearing functional groups mimicking amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH and imidazole) attached to position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of 7&#8208;deazapurines through different linkers. These modified dNTPs were studied as substrates in enzymatic synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA using several DNA polymerases. In primer extension (PEX), all modified dNTPs provided DNA containing one, two, three, or (all) four modified nucleotides each bearing a different modification, although the thiol&#8208;modified dNTPs were worse substrates compared to the others. In PCR, we observed exponential amplification for any combination of one, two or three non&#8208;sulfur dNTPs but the thiol&#8208;modified dNTP did not work well in any combinations. Sequencing of the hypermodified DNA confirmed the good fidelity of the incorporation of all the modified nucleotides. This set of modified dNTPs extends the portfolio of building blocks for prospective use in selections of functional nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] Clusters: Magnetic Properties and Efffcient Conversion of CO2 with Epoxides and Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

Signi&#64257;cantly, cluster 1 displays a larger magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (&#8722;&#916;Sm = 36.83 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.0 K and 7.0 T), while cluster 3 shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior under zero dc field. Moreover, clusters 1&#8208;3 as heterogeneous catalysts can effectively convert CO2 with epoxides and benzylamine to form oxazolidinones under mild conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first reported bifunctional heterometallic heptanuclear clusters which show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Isocoumarins via Light&#8208;Driven Carboxylative Cyclization Reaction of&#160;o&#8208;Ethynyl Aryl Bromides with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods of isocoumarins have been developed. However, the&#160;synthesis of&#160;isocoumarins via the catalytic CO2&#160;fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO2&#160;into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the&#160;light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of&#160;o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides&#160;with CO2, which&#160;selectively&#160;produced&#160;isocoumarins.&#160;Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with&#160;high&#160;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Exchange Polyelectrolytes with High Branching Ratio and Adjustable Free Volume for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of polyelectrolytes that simultaneously meets the requirements for anion exchange membrane (AEM) and ionomer (AEI), especially the opposite gas permeation demands for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with similar chemical structure is challenging. To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide&#8208;ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid&#8208;catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structure is generated which not only addresses the conductivity&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off of AEM, but also possesses high OH&#8208; conductivity for AEI.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rational design of polyelectrolytes that simultaneously meets the requirements for anion exchange membrane (AEM) and ionomer (AEI), especially the opposite gas permeation demands for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with similar chemical structure is challenging. To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide-ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid-catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity-adjustable structure is generated which not only addresses the conductivity-toughness trade-off of AEM, but also possesses high OH- conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI, and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98 V (pure water) and 1.62 V (1M KOH) at 1 A cm-2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high-performance AEMWE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Late&#8208;stage peptide modification is a powerful tool for rapidly generating a library of peptide mimetics e.g. for drug discovery or catalyst development. While late&#8208;stage modifications exist for many types of structural features, methods for introducing amines into peptides via a late&#8208;stage approach are rare, despite their enormous potential for the development of peptide therapeutics. Here we present a protocol for introducing amines into peptides by our established on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach. Our method is compatible with a wide variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, anilines and other heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles mostly giving good to excellent yields. We introduce amines that are pharmacologically relevant as well as those that can impart catalytic or metal binding properties into the peptide of interest. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we introduce the metal ligand tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (tren) into a tryptophan zipper scaffold using our late&#8208;stage amination approach to explore metal&#8208;induced stapling. Indeed, metal complexation via the tren ligand resulted in a thermal stabilization of more than 30 K in one of our tryptophan zipper designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polyoxometalate&#8210;Metal Nanocluster Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
POMs are gaining attention in metal nanocluster synthesis for their ability to impart unique structural and functional roles. This review highlights recent advances in POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids, categorized as follows: (a) hybrids of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands, (b) metal nanoclusters stabilized by POMs as ligands, and (c) solid&#8208;state synthesis of metal nanoclusters using POM&#8208;defined scaffolds.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are structurally well&#8208;defined anionic metal&#8211;oxo clusters with diverse structural forms and distinctive physicochemical properties, including acidity/basicity, redox activity, and optical behavior. Over the past two decades, POMs have garnered increasing attention in metal nanocluster synthesis owing to their ability to impart unique structural and functional characteristics to these compounds. Initially, research in this field primarily focused on hybrid materials composed of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands. However, more recently, studies have demonstrated that POMs can themselves act as effective stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. These POM&#8208;stabilized metal nanoclusters exhibit synergistic and cooperative properties of metal nanocluster and POM components, enabling novel applications in fields such as catalysis, photochemistry, sensing, and electrochemistry. Notably, recent investigations into POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids have demonstrated their potential as atomically precise counterparts to metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on bulk metal oxides, exhibiting the unique cooperative catalysis. This review provides a concise overview of POM&#8210;metal nanocluster hybrids, with an emphasis on recent advancements in synthetic methodologies, properties, and applications. Additionally, solid&#8208;state synthetic strategies leveraging the rigid structures and redox properties of POMs for the controlled formation of metal nanoclusters are discussed.

         <title>Xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C, Novel Lobster&#8208;Shape Cinnamoyltriketone Dimers with Antiviral Activities from Xanthostemon chrysanthus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three pairs of novel enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers (1&#8722;3) with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems were isolated from Xanthostemon chrysanthus via a building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.








Abstract
Three pairs of enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C [(+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8211;3)], were recognized and obtained from Xanthostemon chrysanthus by employing the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Compounds 1&#8211;3 featured two new types of lobster&#8208;shape carbon skeletons with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems. Their structures with absolute configurations were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ECD calculations. Compounds 1&#8211;3 represent the first example of phloroglucinol derivatives that are biogenetically constructed by a De Mayo reaction followed by Michael addition. Additionally, compounds 1&#8211;3 exhibited significant antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Time&#8208;of&#8208;addition assays indicated that compound 3 specifically acts on the early stages of the virus replication process in RSV.

         <title>The vicinal&#8208;d iiodination of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes by N&#8208;Iodo&#8208; succinimide (NIS) through a radical pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,2&#8208;diradical reactivity of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes (thermal) has not been explored well in comparison to their ionic reactivity. Accordingly, the radical trapping reactions of these reactive intermediates are very scarce in literature. Here in we report the iodine&#8208;radical trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of structurally divergent vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) has been employed as the source of radical iodine under thermal heating conditions. The existence of the arene&#8208;radical intermediates and the radical mechanism has been supported by the EPR spectral analysis of the reaction mixture. Several fruitful control experiments suggested that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation. The process is general in terms of substituents on the diynes as well as the nature of the tethering units. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal/Metal Sulfide Heterostructures Boost Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production Coupled with Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production through the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising pathway for sustainable and green energy. Coupling HER with the thermodynamically favorable sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) can reduce energy consumption and recycle industrial by&#8208;product S2&#8722;. However, the development and practical application are hindered by the lack of cost&#8208;effective and robust catalysts. Herein, we constructed a bifunctional electrode with rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures using NiFe foam through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S). Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, it delivers outstanding SOR and HER performance. The integrated cell, utilizing the NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S electrode for both the cathode and anode, achieves a remarkable cell voltage of 0.75 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 1.43 V lower than conventional water electrolysis. It demonstrates extraordinary long&#8208;term durability over 1100 hours without significant decay, achieving high Faradaic efficiencies (&#8805;99%) and low electricity consumption (1.79 kWh m&#8722;3 H2) for hydrogen production. This work paves the way for environmentally friendly strategies, combining cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production with value&#8208;added sulfur recovery, offering a reliable option for bifunctional catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Impacts of Chalcogen Bonding on the Stability and Reactivity of 5&#8208;Iminothianthrene Platform: Toward Electrophilic Nitrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thianthrene scaffold has recently attracted significant attention in various coupling reactions. Although 5&#8208;iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5&#8208;iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity. Finally, the potential of N&#8208;acyliminothianthrenes as N&#8208;acylnitrene equivalents were demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Cyclopeptide&#8208;Based Chemical Models for Allosteric Disulfide and Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here a series of isomeric disulfide&#8208;based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self&#8208;assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 23&#8208;membered macrocycle showed the presence of intra molecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X&#8208;ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with &#8208;LHHook geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Binuclear Lanthanide Complexes as Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging Probes for Redox Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing nitrophenol, azophenol and azide chromophores can be reduced to the amine, giving rise to dramatic changes in the luminescence behavior. Such reductions can be achieved using enzymes as well as by chemical means. The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing.








Abstract
We report a family of lanthanide(III) complexes that act as redox probes via both magnetic resonance (MR) and luminescence outputs. The ligands are functionalized with nitro, azobenzene and azide groups which are reduced to a common aniline product, and each responds to both chemical and biocatalytic reductive conditions at different cathodic onset potentials. By judicious choice of complexed Ln(III), the probes can be optimized either for use in MR imaging (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd), or as highly efficient turn&#8208;on luminescence probes (Ln&#160;=&#160;Tb). The Tb(III) analogues are essentially nonemissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488&#160;nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing, such as the imaging of hypoxic environments in biology.

         <title>Localized Breakdown of the Niobium Anodic Oxide Film by Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of niobium anodic oxide films&#160;depends on the bromide concentration and potential scan rate. Related experimental relationships agree with the predictions of a point defect model (PDM) under certain conditions. Within the same potential region, niobium maintains passivity in the more aggressive chloride media. PDM is used to explain the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion of niobium






.

Abstract
The growth of the anodic oxide passive film on Nb and its stability were studied in aqueous bromide media. Potentiodynamic polarization up to 12 VSCE showed that passive Nb loses its stability resulting in either metastable or stable pitting corrosion depending on the bromide concentration and the potential scan rate. On the contrary, Nb remains passive in the more aggressive chloride media where most passive metals and alloys are often susceptible to localized breakdown. This unusual bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb occurs for bromide concentrations higher than 0.25&#160;M at a critical breakdown potential (Eb). Stable active dissolution in pits was observed at potentials higher than Eb. &#932;&#959; get an insight into the physicochemical processes responsible for the susceptibility of Nb to the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion, the oxide growth and its breakdown are discussed in terms of a point defect model (PDM). Experimental relationships between Eb and either the bromide activity or the potential scan rate agree with the PDM predictions. The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb seems to be associated with the absorption of bromides preferably on lattice anion vacancies at the oxide|electrolyte interface leading through a series of processes to vacancy condensation at the Nb|oxide interface.

         <title>Highly Emissive Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene Hybrid as Easily Processable and Stable OLED Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; hexabenzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene fluorescent dye was synthesized using an easily scalable reaction. Green emission at around 500&#160;nm, a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67% in toluene, and high solubility in a wide range of solvents result from the distorted structure. A green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) was fabricated without extensive optimization showcasing easy processability of the molecule class.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dye with a &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; core, derived from the related hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene (HBC) core with a fluoranthene subunit. The fluorophore is composed of a pure carbon skeleton without heteroatoms and exhibits remarkable photoluminescence properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 67% in toluene, exceeding that of the parent HBC by a factor of 30. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals the distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure, which is responsible for the optoelectronic properties, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We show that the new fluorescent dye can be readily used for the fabrication of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) without extensive optimization, whereby solubility in a variety of solvents and successful film formation are decisive.

         <title>Excited State Branching Processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced electron transfer processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;based push&#8211;pull&#8211;push architecture which combines an inorganic and organic chromophore are elucidated in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach. The applied design concept allows the excited state to be localized away from the metal onto the organic chromophore.








Abstract
Excited state properties such as excitation energy, accessibility of the respective excited state either by direct or indirect population transfer, and its lifetime govern the application of these excited states in light&#8208;driven reactions, for example, photocatalysis using transition metal complexes. Compared with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) states, charge&#8208;separated (3CS) excited states involving organic moieties, such as triplet intra&#8208;ligand or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3ILCT and 3LLCT) states, tend to possess longer&#8208;lived excited states due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling with the closed&#8208;shell ground state. Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic chromophores enables isolating the triplet states onto the organic chromophore. In this study, we aim to elucidate the excited&#8208;state relaxation processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;terpyridyl donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor system (RuCl) in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical simulations and dissipative quantum dynamics. The electron transfer (ET) processes involving the low&#8208;lying 3MLCT, 3ILCT, and 3LLCT excited states were investigated experimentally and computationally within a semiclassical Marcus picture.

&lt;p&gt;The photoinduced electron transfer processes in a Ru(II)-based push&#8211;pull&#8211;push architecture which combines an inorganic and organic chromophore are elucidated in a joint spectroscopic-theoretical approach. The applied design concept allows the excited state to be localized away from the metal onto the organic chromophore.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited state properties such as excitation energy, accessibility of the respective excited state either by direct or indirect population transfer, and its lifetime govern the application of these excited states in light-driven reactions, for example, photocatalysis using transition metal complexes. Compared with triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT) states, charge-separated (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CS) excited states involving organic moieties, such as triplet intra-ligand or ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;ILCT and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT) states, tend to possess longer-lived excited states due to the weak spin-orbit coupling with the closed-shell ground state. Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic chromophores enables isolating the triplet states onto the organic chromophore. In this study, we aim to elucidate the excited-state relaxation processes in a Ru(II)-terpyridyl donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor system (&lt;b&gt;RuCl&lt;/b&gt;) in a joint spectroscopic-theoretical approach combining steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical simulations and dissipative quantum dynamics. The electron transfer (ET) processes involving the low-lying &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;ILCT, and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT excited states were investigated experimentally and computationally within a semiclassical Marcus picture. Finally, dissipative quantum dynamical simulations&#8212;capable of describing incomplete ET processes involving all three states&#8212;enabled us to unravel the competitive relaxation channels at short and long timescales among the strongly coupled &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;ILCT states and weakly coupled &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;ILCT-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Suppression by Targeting Senescent Cells with a Selective Singlet Oxygen Releasing Endoperoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Galactosidase&#8208;triggered release of singlet oxygen is shown to target and selectively eliminate senescent cells. In addition, data obtained using tumor models reveal a significant suppression of tumor progression by targeted singlet oxygen release.








Abstract
Targeting senescent cells for cancer treatment is an important recent direction. In this work, we designed and synthesized a galactoside&#8208;functionalized pyridone endoperoxide. The endoperoxide in this form, releases singlet oxygen at a relatively slow rate, but when transformed by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity, the pyridone endoperoxide releases singlet oxygen with a half&#8208;life of 30 minutes at 37 &#176;C. We also studied this compound with a variety of cell lines with differential &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expression levels. Cytotoxicity of the target compound is enhanced in high galactosidase&#8208;expressing SKOV&#8208;3 cells. In vivo tests with tumor models also showed significant suppression of tumor progression. Targeting singlet oxygen to senescent cells appears to be promising new approach for treating diseases concurrent with aging, including cancer.

         <title>Toward Symmetric Organic Aqueous Flow Batteries: Triarylamine&#8208;Based Bipolar Molecules and Their Characterization via an Extended Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules based on a triarylamine skeleton and a viologen unit for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries are presented. Cyclic voltammetry shows that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety can be reversibly reduced. A modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis is presented to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region.








Abstract
Symmetric organic flow batteries (SOFBs) can potentially address membrane crossover problems by employing bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules (BROMs). Herein, a triarylamine (TAA) skeleton was chosen as a posolyte moiety for a new class of bipolar molecules for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries (FBs). Pyridinium and viologen derivatives were tethered to the posolyte moiety, and the new compounds were characterized. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety via a Zincke reaction, could be reversibly reduced. Varying the supporting electrolyte concentration on the selected derivative revealed water solubility as a challenge for further development. The selected derivative, MeO&#8208;TPA&#8208;Vi&#8208;DMAE, was subjected to hydrodynamic voltammetry, and a modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis was developed to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region, which are often seen with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. This model discarded a purely Ohmic effect, showing a useful Levich slope at a certain overpotential before the onset of a secondary reaction. TAA&#8208;based BROMs hold promise for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous SOFBs, and the results will guide the design of new derivatives. The three&#8208;term Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich relation here introduced will be useful not only to develop BROM&#8208;based FBs but will most likely appeal to a much broader audience.

         <title>Dense Li Deposition and Enhanced Flame&#8208;retardant Enabled by Localized Strong Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed a localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions&#8208;based electrolyte with solvation structure involving dual anions. The electrolyte not only exhibits excellent flame retardancy, but also forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for dense Li deposition, which significantly improves the cycling life of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Uncontrolled lithium (Li) deposition can lead to the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead&#8221; Li, accelerating the degradation of cycling stability and safety performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve dense Li deposition and flame&#8208;retardant by designing an electrolyte based on localized strong ion&#8208;dipole (LSID) interactions. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions between the multiple&#8208;dipole solvent (G4), NO3&#8722;, FSI&#8722;, and Li+ promote the formation of Li+ primary solvation sheaths for stabilizing Li deposition behavior. While the weak dipole fluorine&#8208;containing diluent (TTE) is distributed in the secondary solvation sheath due to weak ion&#8208;dipole interactions of Li+&#8208;TTE to improve interfacial wettability and flame retardancy due to preferential separation. Consequently, the localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions strategy in the designed electrolyte successfully achieves a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% for Li||Cu cells, and ultrathin Li&#8208;matched Li||LFP and Li||NCM523 cells also demonstrate excellent cycling stability, as well as an improved safety performance of LMBs.

ML accelerates sustainable polymer development by replacing resource&#8208;extensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods with efficient predictive modeling for catalyst discovery, polymer property optimization and new material design.








Abstract
Sustainable polymers from renewable resources have been gaining importance due to their recyclability and reduced environmental impact. However, their development through conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and resource&#8208;intensive. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in polymer science, enabling rapid prediction, and discovery of new chemicals and materials. In this review, we examine emerging trends in ML applications for sustainable polymer development, focusing on catalyst discovery, property optimization, and new polymer design. We analyze unique challenges in applying ML to sustainable polymers and evaluate proposed solutions, providing insights for future development in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Endohedral Coordination of Bulky Substrates in Metalloenzyme&#8208;Like Organometallic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organometallic nanotube with eight CuI ions mimics metalloenzyme behavior, featuring a flexible pore, metal&#8208;ligand substrate binding, and redox&#8208;active metals. Insertion of THF as a model substrate is driven by coordination, as confirmed by SC&#8208;XRD, NMR, and DFT. Electrochemical studies of a derived rotaxane reveal metal&#8208;centered redox activity.






.

Abstract
Artificial receptors inspired by metalloenzymes share three key properties: a structurally flexible cavity, substrate binding via metal&#8208;ligand coordination, and metal&#8208;based redox activity.

&lt;p&gt;An organometallic nanotube with eight Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ions mimics metalloenzyme behavior, featuring a flexible pore, metal-ligand substrate binding, and redox-active metals. Insertion of THF as a model substrate is driven by coordination, as confirmed by SC-XRD, NMR, and DFT. Electrochemical studies of a derived rotaxane reveal metal-centered redox activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial receptors inspired by metalloenzymes share three key properties: a structurally flexible cavity, substrate binding &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; metal-ligand coordination, and metal-based redox activity. Herein, we report an organometallic nanotube with such features based on our supramolecular pillarplex platform, incorporating eight Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; centers in its cavitand walls. The structurally adaptable cavity of this receptor enables the endohedral coordination of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a hydrophilic model substrate with remarkable binding affinity despite a steric mismatch between the host and guest.

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalized Cyanine Fluorogenic Dimers for Improved Detection of GPCRs: Application to Imaging of ApelinR in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;mediated functionalization of a cyanine 5.5 bearing a terminal alkyne gave a rapid access to a library of ten new cyanine dyes and their corresponding dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study led to the identification of an optimal dimer which was conjugated to the apelin&#8208;17 ligand and enabled imaging of ApelinR under no&#8208;wash conditions.








Abstract
Fluorogenic dimers enable background&#8208;free imaging of biological targets under wash&#8208;free conditions owing to a strong fluorescence enhancement in the apolar cell microenvironment. However, it is crucial that the imaging probe interacts solely with the target receptor to avoid nonspecific interactions and ensure detection with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, we describe a convenient and rapid approach for the synthesis of various functionalized cyanine dyes by click chemistry allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of the physicochemical and fluorogenic properties of the dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study was conducted for the fluorogenic dimers in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and liposomes as models of serum proteins and cell membranes. We identified d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E which combined the lowest nonspecific interactions with the optimal fluorescence turn&#8208;on properties. By conjugating d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E to a peptide ligand of the apelin GPCR, we developed Ap&#9472;d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E, the first fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe for the background&#8208;free imaging of this receptor in living cells.

         <title>Development of Water&#8208;Soluble 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridinesulfenate for Disulfide Bond Formation of Peptide Under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly water&#8208;soluble Npy&#8208;sulfenate functions as an efficient oxidizing agent for the formation of disulfide bonds in thiol&#8208;containing peptides. The Npy&#8208;sulfenate can be used to form a disulfide bond with a thiol&#8208;containing peptide produced by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free NCL, thereby facilitating the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin. These results provide a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for cyclic disulfide peptides based on sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.








Abstract
Establishing an efficient method for the synthesis of disulfide bonds in peptides is an important challenge for the further development of several research fields, including peptide&#8208;based medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine (Npy) sulfenate that efficiently forms intramolecular disulfide bonds in reduced peptides. Moreover, Npy&#8208;sulfenate formed a disulfide bond in a thiol&#8208;containing peptide prepared by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free native chemical ligation (NCL), as demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin, which contains 52 amino acid residues. This study provides a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for preparing mid&#8208;sized cyclic disulfide peptides via sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.

         <title>Synthetic Studies on Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Tabercarpamines and Voacangine&#8208;Type Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unified catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (iso)voacangines, 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;(iso)voacangines, and (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines were achieved for the first time. The syntheses hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reconstruction from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system at the late stage.








Abstract
The proposed post&#8208;iboga natural products, (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, along with their corresponding C20 stereoisomers and C10&#8208;methoxy&#8208;regioisomers were synthesized. An extensive NMR spectroscopic study showed that the spectral data of these synthetic compounds were not consistent with the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I in isolation report, indicating that the proposed structures were misassigned. Subsequently, from the advanced intermediates for the synthesis of the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, the unified enantioselective syntheses of six iboga&#8210;type natural products including (&#8208;)&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;voacangine, (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;voacangine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanoisovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanovoacangine were accomplished via a divergent manner. The synthetic route provided the first catalytic asymmetric approach to access these three types of iboga&#8210;type natural products and achieved the first enantioselective syntheses of (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines. Our synthesis hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reorganization process from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system&#8213;a pathway opposite to the proposed biogenic synthesis&#8213;at the late stage.

         <title>Oxidative Release of Natural Glycans (ORNG): Preparation of Truncated N&#8208;glycans for Engineering Glycoproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce a groundbreaking method of oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG), enabling the efficient synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N&#8208;glycans. Leveraging this innovative approach, we generate a versatile library of truncated N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, facilitating the homogeneous glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies. Our results showcase the potential of ORNG in enhancing glycoprotein synthesis, offering substantial implications for biomedical research and therapeutic applications. Through detailed analysis and application, this work provides a foundation for future advancements in glycoengineering, aiming to overcome traditional barriers in glycan synthesis and functional exploration.








Abstract
N&#8208;glycosylation on asparagine is one of the most common post&#8208;translational modifications of proteins. The synthesis of homogeneous N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins is crucial for elucidating the concerted functions of glycans and peptides. Multiple endoglycosidase mutants have been developed to efficiently catalyze the coupling of oxazoline derivatives of N&#8208;glycans lacking the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycan) with peptide chains bearing a GlcNAcylated asparagine. However, the bottleneck for N&#8208;glycopeptide and glycoprotein synthesis remains access to these complex truncated N&#8208;glycan substrates in sufficient diversity and quantity. Here, we report a novel chemical method using modified oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG) to produce a diverse library of mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, paving the way for the facile synthesis of N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Using these substrates, homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies can be efficiently achieved.

         <title>Ni(OH)x/Ni&#8208;Catalyzed In Situ Hydrogenation and Ethanol Ethoxylation of 2&#8208;Methylfuran for Renewable Biofuel Co&#8208;Upgrading</title>

Abstract
Bioethanol and furanics are currently prevailing additives to fossil&#8208;based transportation fuels. With the objective to lift the longstanding limitations of these biofuel additives, this work reports for the first time the synthesis of 2&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF) as a co&#8208;upgraded fuel by reacting ethanol with 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF). The formation of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF is achieved through ethanol ethoxylation of 2&#8208;MF, enabled by a reverse Ni(OH)x/Ni catalyst under hydrogen pressure. Nickel hydroxide species over the Ni nanoparticles play a crucial role in activating ethanol and polarizing the partially hydrogenated dihydrofuran intermediates, favorably steering the reaction selectively toward the ethoxylation product. The reaction conditions, including pressure and temperature, are systematically optimized to enhance the yield of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF, and provide a means to beneficially tune the fuel compositions consisting mainly of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF and 2&#8208;MTHF, both are high energy density molecules. Importantly, the reverse Ni(OH)x&#8208;Ni catalyst allows a one&#8208;pot process to accomplish consecutive partial hydrogenation of 2&#8208;MF and ethanol ethoxylation. This work provides a practical strategy for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived polar primary fuel molecules into more versatile fuels and chemicals.

         <title>Quantitative Generation of HF from KF and Formation of Amine&#8208;3HF Complexes by Using Cation Exchange Reaction Between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of HF from KF at room temperature was demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY. The generated HF was quantitatively converted to a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes as candidates for nucleophilic fluorinating reagents.








Abstract
A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from potassium fluoride (KF) at room temperature was successfully demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY in acetonitrile (MeCN). After one of the cation exchange reactions, HF was generated from KF in 69% yield. On the other hand, HF was generated quantitatively by removing the generated HF and repeating the cation exchange reaction seven times. During and after the cation exchange reaction, the generated HF was separated from the Amberlyst 15DRY by decantation and filtration without loss of HF. When the Amberlyst 15DRY was regenerated and then reused in the cation exchange reaction ten times, HF was generated almost quantitatively each time and the yield of HF did not decrease at all. In addition, when 1/3 equivalent of amines was added to the resulting HF&#8208;containing solution, a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes with controlled stoichiometric ratios were formed in quantitative yields.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site CuZn Alloy Boosts Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia via Optimized Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic CuZn optimizes the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of NOx and NOxH (x&#160;=&#160;1, 2, and 3) intermediates. The synergistic effect between Cu and Zn sites breaks the scaling relationship and enhances catalytic activity.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an effective way to solve nitrate pollution and a promising strategy for ammonia (NH3) synthesis under ambient temperature and pressure. However, NO3RR is still hindered by the lack of efficient catalysts and an understanding of mechanisms that enhance the catalytic performance. In this study, we propose intermetallic alloying as a promising strategy to optimize the NO3RR reaction pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of intermediates, as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations comparing NO3RR performance of Cu (111) and CuZn (110) surfaces. In CuZn alloy, the electron&#8208;donating property of Cu weakens the adsorption of NOx (x = 1, 2, and 3) intermediates, whereas the electron&#8208;accepting property of Zn strengthens the binding of NOxH intermediates, thus lowering the protonation reaction energy. Zn sites preferentially promote the removal of O species, whereas Cu sites dominate the protonation of N species. This synergistic effect enables CuZn (110) surface to successfully break the undesirable scaling relationship in traditional metal catalysts, resulting in excellent catalytic activity for NO3RR, with an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of &#8722;0.28&#160;V. This work provides valuable insights and theoretical guidance for NO3RR.

For the first time, the coordination of Co2+ ions with (C2O4)2&#8722; ions in borate systems was observed. Notably, upon pyrolyzing precursor compound 1, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed a catalyst with a carbon&#8208;supported Co nanocrystal structure, which significantly enhanced the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential comparable to that of Pt/C. More importantly, the catalyst outperformed Pt/C when applied in a zinc&#8208;air battery.

         <title>The Effect of Aldehyde and Carboxylic Acid Substitution on the Isomerization of Hemithioindigo Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core of an HTI photoswitch with different oxidation states of the sulfur heteroatom was modified by introducing aldehydes and carboxylic acid substituents for tailored absorption, quantum yields, and thermal stability. Notably, the substituted HTIs enabled high isomerization yields, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduces photochromism. Solid&#8208;state photoisomerization was demonstrated on an HTI that was incorporated into a MOF.








Abstract
Hemithioindigo (HTI) photoswitches exhibit robust photoisomerization under visible light and relatively high thermal bistability. In this work, we report various modifications of the HTI core, namely the introduction of aldehydes and carboxylic acids at the para position of the stilbene fragment with different oxidation states of the sulfur center, and the incorporation of a Schiff base moiety. These modifications allowed tuning of the absorption properties, quantum yields of isomerization, and thermal stability of the metastable E&#8208;isomers. Notably, the formyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;substituted HTI switches achieved high yields of isomerization under visible light in various solvents, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduced photochromism. Schiff base formation led to red&#8208;shifted absorption and increased thermal stability. Finally, by leveraging the carboxyl substituents, we incorporated an HTI chromophore into the NU&#8208;1000 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and demonstrated solid&#8208;state photoisomerization. These findings highlight key structural modifications that expand the applicability of HTI photoswitches for molecular switching in solution and solid&#8208;state environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemithioindigo (HTI) photoswitches exhibit robust photoisomerization under visible light and relatively high thermal bistability. In this work, we report various modifications of the HTI core, namely the introduction of aldehydes and carboxylic acids at the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; position of the stilbene fragment with different oxidation states of the sulfur center, and the incorporation of a Schiff base moiety. These modifications allowed tuning of the absorption properties, quantum yields of isomerization, and thermal stability of the metastable &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-isomers. Notably, the formyl- and carboxyl-substituted HTI switches achieved high yields of isomerization under visible light in various solvents, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduced photochromism. Schiff base formation led to red-shifted absorption and increased thermal stability. Finally, by leveraging the carboxyl substituents, we incorporated an HTI chromophore into the NU-1000 metal-organic framework (MOF), and demonstrated solid-state photoisomerization. These findings highlight key structural modifications that expand the applicability of HTI photoswitches for molecular switching in solution and solid-state environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework &#8208; Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF&#8208;based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&#8210;1 at 90&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF&#8208;modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next&#8208;generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton&#8208;conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Halogen Engineering in Carbazole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic incorporation of bromine into the carbazole dimer enables an efficient transition from thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in crystalline Cz&#8208;D to predominantly room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D, demonstrating a versatile strategy for modulating luminescent&#160;properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in metal&#8208;free organic materials offers immense potential for advanced optoelectronic applications. However, the rational design and fine&#8208;tuning of RTP remain challenging due to the complex correlation between molecular structure and photophysical processes. Herein, we explored the impact of intersystem crossing (ISC), spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), and halogen interactions to promote RTP in crystalline brominated carbazole dimer (BrCz&#8208;D). In contrast, the unsubstituted analogue, carbazole dimer (Cz&#8208;D) exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) under ambient conditions. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy measurements confirmed the population of triplet manifolds in both dimers. Bromine substitution significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling (VSOC&#160;=&#160;14.94 cm&#8315;&#185;), enabling efficient ISC and robust RTP in BrCz&#8208;D. Enhanced RTP in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D is attributed to unique halogen interactions, including Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, C&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, within the crystal lattice. Such halogen interactions are negligible in the solution state, accounting for the lack of RTP under ambient conditions. The present work highlights the critical role of SOC and halogen bonding in achieving efficient RTP for designing high&#8208;performance organic phosphorescent materials through crystallochemistry.

         <title>Single Crystals of a Covalent Organic Polymer for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the preparation of 1D polymer single crystals (CityU&#8208;49) based on dative boron&#8208;nitrogen bonds. The dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enabled precise self&#8208;assembly and high crystallinity. CityU&#8208;49 has been demonstrated to show excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving 95% degradation of rhodamine B in 300 minutes highlighting its potential for environmental remediation and advancing the design of crystalline covalent organic polymers.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) with high crystallinity and excellent stability is very important for potential applications in photocatalysis and environmental remediation. However, most COPs are amorphous, limiting their structural characterization, photocatalytic performance, and mechanism exploration. In this study, we report the construction of a crystalline 1D COP (CityU&#8208;49) via dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds using 3,6&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (DPC) as the nitrogen donor and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) as the boron donor. The dynamic and directional nature of B&#8592;N bonds enables a self&#8208;healing and self&#8208;correcting assembly process resulting in a highly crystalline and stable structure. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) revealed the precise structure of CityU&#8208;49 providing insights into its ordered architecture. The photocatalytic performance of CityU&#8208;49 was conducted to investigat the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) (a persistent and toxic organic pollutant). Under UV light irradiation, CityU&#8208;49 achieves 95% degradation of RhB in 300 minutes demonstrating excellent photocatalytic activity and environmental applicability. This study highlights the potential of crystalline COPs as efficient and sustainable photocatalysts paving the way for the development of advanced materials for environmental remediation and green technologies.

         <title>Exploiting Activated Alkyne Chemistry for the Synthesis of Tailored Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Assemblies for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) synthesized via activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and self&#8208;assemble into fluorescent nanostructures, including dendrimersomes and micelles.

This work highlights an efficient approach for synthesizing AJDs for designing advanced nanomaterials with tunable optical properties.








Abstract
Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) are a promising class of macromolecules capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this study, AJDs were synthesized employing, for the first time, the activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry approach, enabling the construction of dendritic architectures under mild conditions. The AJDs were functionalized with a &#960;&#8208;extended tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative, imparting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. These AJDs self&#8208;assembled into fluorescent nanostructures, including micelles and dendrimersomes, with tunable dimensions. The AIE&#8208;active assemblies demonstrated strong photoluminescence upon formation and were characterized by narrow size distributions. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies using Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO&#8208;K1) cells revealed excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, confirming their potential for live&#8208;cell imaging. Importantly, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the TPE derivative facilitated excitation at longer wavelengths, compatible with conventional confocal microscopy. This work showcases the versatility of activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry in dendrimer synthesis and highlights the potential of these AJD&#8208;based nanostructures in nanomedicine, particularly for imaging and diagnostic applications.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Binding Properties of Non&#8208;Intercalating Water&#8208;Soluble Organometallic Ir(III) Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of water&#8208;soluble, organometallic iridium(III) complexes has been studied with respect to their DNA binding behavior. A combined biophysical and computational study reveals the subtle interplay of non&#8208;intercalative DNA binding events that are modulated by small changes in ligand structure.








Abstract
A series of Ir(III) complexes, [Ir(C^N)2(en)]+ (where C^N&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzo[d]thiazolyl cyclometalating ligand; en&#160;=&#160;ethylene diamine), is reported with structural variation via a substituent (H, Me, OMe, Cl, OCF3) at the coordinated phenyl ring. The complexes were soluble in aqueous buffer, with solubility limits correlating inversely with the predicted logP. The complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#160;nm (&#949; &#8764; 5000&#160;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) due to charge&#8208;transfer transitions and are triplet emitters in aerated buffer (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;529&#8211;540&#160;nm; lifetimes up to 0.763 &#181;s; &#934;em&#160;&#8804;&#160;12%). Each complex was investigated, via computational and biophysical experiments, in the context of DNA binding. According to UV&#8208;visible titrations, the cationic complexes bind to DNA with apparent affinities ranging from 6&#160;&#215;&#160;104 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;M&#8722;1 with apparent binding site sizes between 0.4 and 1.0 base pairs. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that complexes [Ir(L1&#8208;3)2(en)]Cl bind to DNA in two types of binding sites, viz., a high&#8208;affinity (107&#8211;108&#160;M&#8722;1) binding site with characteristics of minor or major groove binding and a low&#8208;affinity binding site (105&#160;M&#8722;1) with characteristics of non&#8208;specific binding to negatively charged DNA, with binding supported by hydrophobic interactions between complexes.

&lt;p&gt;A series of water-soluble, organometallic iridium(III) complexes has been studied with respect to their DNA binding behavior. A combined biophysical and computational study reveals the subtle interplay of non-intercalative DNA binding events that are modulated by small changes in ligand structure.

         <title>Two&#8208;photon Excitation of Bright Diaza[4]Helicenes for Isotropic and Circularly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris&#8208;p&#8208;OMe cationic diaza[4]helicenes with improved (CPL) brightness (up to 3.4 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 for 2d) are achieved by combining high &#934;f and enhanced chiroptical properties arising with branched N&#8208;substituents. Efficient 2PE at 810&#160;nm and 2PE CPL spectra are reported, the latter being uncommon for small organic molecules. Their viability in cell imaging by 1PE and 2PE confocal microscopy was also proven.








Abstract
Helicenes are chiral organic dyes that are attracting growing attention due to the high tunability of their (chir)optical and electronic properties. In this work, a series of functionalized cationic diaza[4]helicenes based on dimethoxyquinacridinium (DMQA) scaffolds are presented. By merging branched N&#8208;alkyl side chains and triple para&#8208;functionalization with OMe groups, structures combine improved chiroptical responses (5x increase) and strong fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f&#160;&#8776;&#160;70% in acetonitrile). An overall improved efficiency of the emission of circularly polarized light with BCPL values reaching 3.4 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 is obtained. Additionally, two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) studies were performed, showing good values of cross section (CS) at 810&#160;nm. Interestingly, 2PE circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were acquired for the most performant derivatives (N&#8208;isopropyl and N&#8208;cyclohexyl); this type of measurement being usually challenging for organic molecular species. Finally, the viability of these compounds in single&#8208;photon (1PE)&#160;and 2PE microscopy is also shown.

         <title>Higher BODIPY Homologues&#8211;Synthesis, Reactivity, and Photoluminescence Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher homologues of the well&#8208;known BODIPY dyes for boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium are described. These have been obtained with the halogen substituents chlorine, bromine, and iodine and as mixed substituted compounds with methyl and halogen substituents. The optical properties are described as well as the observation of excimers.








Abstract
The synthesis of MesDPM group 13 (B&#9472;In, MesDPM&#160;=&#160;1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene) compounds with halide substituents (Cl&#9472;I) is described. All compounds were fully characterized including NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. In addition, the solid state molecular structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As higher representatives of BODIPY (boron difluoride dipyrromethene) dyes, some of these MesDPM triel dihalides also exhibit an intense green fluorescence when exposed to sunlight. In this regard, the optical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy giving absorption maxima around 520&#160;nm and fluorescence emission in the range between 550 and 660&#160;nm. Fluorescence quantum efficiencies up to 42% could be obtained from measurements in toluene solution. Further, reactivity studies were carried out which opened&#8208;up access to mixed substituted MesDPM triels with one alkyl and one halide substituent.

The AD&#8208;HoC platform streamlines photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, eliminating catalyst, ligand, and base optimization. Machine learning predicts reactivity and selects additives using substrate electronic and geometric traits. Quantum mechanical calculations and cheminformatics enhance understanding, while an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool predicts outcomes from SMILES (Simplified Molecular&#8208;Input Line&#8208;Entry System) boosting synthetic precision and efficiency.








Abstract
Under visible light&#8208;driven redox conditions, employing transition&#8208;metal catalysis provides a powerful platform for constructing C(sp2)&#8211;(hetero)atom bonds. Although these reactions are highly significant, they require precise optimization of reaction parameters. K&#246;nig, Ghosh, and colleagues introduced an adaptive dynamic homogeneous catalysis (AD&#8208;HoC) platform that furnishes robust, high&#8208;yield conditions for photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The AD&#8208;HoC system eliminates the need to optimize catalysts, ligands, and bases, instead, it achieves C(sp2)&#8211;(hetero)atom bond coupling by merely altering additives and substrate molecules. Leveraging the predictability of reaction conditions within the AD&#8208;HoC system, machine learning offers a method to evaluate the reactivity of substrate combinations and the categories of additives. Our research integrates high&#8208;throughput quantum mechanical calculations with cheminformatics approaches to explore the reactivity of substrate combinations and the selection of additives within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Further data&#8208;driven analysis reveals that the electronic characteristics of electrophiles and the geometric characteristics of nucleophiles are key factors regulating reactivity within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Herein, we present an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool for prediction starting from the SMILES (Simplified Molecular&#8208;Input Line&#8208;Entry System) representation. This work demonstrates the collaborative use of computational statistics and machine learning to predict the reactivity and reaction conditions of substrate combinations, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of synthetic processes.

         <title>Tandem ADMET and CAMMP to Access Degradable Thermosets and Multiblock Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diene small molecule monomers, serving as monomers, are polymerized via ADMET to produce macromonomers with varying degrees of polymerization. By judiciously selecting copolymerizable cycloolefin monomers, this approach enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly degradable thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers that exhibit excellent material properties.








Abstract
The development of degradable polymers and multiblock copolymeric (MBCP) compatibilizers represents an appealing strategy to address ever&#8208;growing concerns for treating waste plastics of traditional chemical degradation or mechanical recycling. Although recent advancements in cyclic&#8211;acyclic monomers metathesis polymerization (CAMMP) and tandem olefin metathesis polymerization (TOMP) have recently been reported to produce degradable polymers and MBCPs via copolymerization of cyclic monomers with acyclic diene comonomers, there have been no reports of preparing high&#8208;performance thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers within the same polymerization system solely through the selection of cycloolefin monomers. To achieve this objective, a TOMP system has been designed that combines acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of diene comonomers followed by CAMMP with cyclic olefin monomers (dicyclopentadiene DCPD or cyclooctene COE). The selection of different cyclic olefin monomers provided access to degradable cross&#8208;linked thermosets and multiblock copolymers.

     alt="Tandem ADMET and CAMMP to Access Degradable Thermosets and Multiblock Copolymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diene small molecule monomers, serving as monomers, are polymerized via ADMET to produce macromonomers with varying degrees of polymerization. By judiciously selecting copolymerizable cycloolefin monomers, this approach enables the one-pot synthesis of highly degradable thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers that exhibit excellent material properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of degradable polymers and multiblock copolymeric (MBCP) compatibilizers represents an appealing strategy to address ever-growing concerns for treating waste plastics of traditional chemical degradation or mechanical recycling. Although recent advancements in cyclic&#8211;acyclic monomers metathesis polymerization (CAMMP) and tandem olefin metathesis polymerization (TOMP) have recently been reported to produce degradable polymers and MBCPs via copolymerization of cyclic monomers with acyclic diene comonomers, there have been no reports of preparing high-performance thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers within the same polymerization system solely through the selection of cycloolefin monomers. To achieve this objective, a TOMP system has been designed that combines acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of diene comonomers followed by CAMMP with cyclic olefin monomers (dicyclopentadiene DCPD or cyclooctene COE). The selection of different cyclic olefin monomers provided access to degradable cross-linked thermosets and multiblock copolymers. Notably, this one-pot, two-step process is highly efficient and requires the addition of only one metathesis catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ligands to Smart Coordination Polymers: Cyanothiazole&#8208;Cu(I) Complexes for Multifunctional Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanothiazoles, paired with copper(I) iodide, form complexes with luminescent properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed two types of coordination polymers, while spectroscopic, synchrotron, and electric measurements supported by density functional (DFT) calculations studies highlighted their unique electronic features, offering a foundation for future research.








Abstract
Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine&#8208;tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;chalcogen I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8211;Vis) spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.

         <title>Core&#8208;Twisted, Cationic Perylene Diimides; Homochiral Dimerization and Chiroptical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The installation of two 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium heterocycles on the aromatic core of a perylene diimide (PDI) generates a twisted and cationic organic dye. As potent hydrogen bond donors, these groups enable the PDI to self&#8208;assemble into discrete and robust homochiral dimers in solution. Furthermore, the enantioselective recognition of chiral anions is exploited for chiroptical sensing.








Abstract
Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are chiral organic dyes that may be exploited for self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials or for the enantioselective recognition and sensing of chiral substrates. Discrete self&#8208;assembled dimers and host&#8211;guest complexes of core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides are important for furthering our understanding of this supramolecular chemistry, yet they are rare because the twisted perylene core significantly weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with the PDI's &#960;&#8208;surface. To address this challenge, we have installed hydrogen bond donor groups in the PDI's bay positions, which direct the formation of a robust, co&#8208;facial and homochiral intermolecular PDI dimer. The structure of this discrete dimer is distinct from previous aggregates of non&#8208;planar PDIs that utilize the imide position for hydrogen bonding. We also uncover the potential of core&#8208;twisted, dicationic PDIs for the enantioselective recognition and chiroptical sensing of chiral anions and investigate the basis of this response via chiral complementarity in the discrete host&#8211;guest complex.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;responsive membranes possess tunable pores and surface properties, offering great potential in the field of smart separation. This review provides a detailed overview of their fabrication methods and applications in separation, along with our perspectives on current challenges and future prospects.








Abstract
Membrane separation technology is one of the most important techniques in modern separation science. To understand the self&#8208;regulation mechanisms of cell membranes and mimic their working principles, a plethora of artificial membranes with responsive abilities to external stimuli have been engineered and prepared, whose smart sieving functions continue to attract attention and are applied in various fields. Among all the known stimuli, gas as a new trigger mode exhibits certain biocompatibility and offer irreplaceable advantages compared to other stimuli, such as cleanliness, ease&#8208;of&#8208;handling, and nondestructive, which make gas&#8208;responsive membranes as one of the most promising, smart separation materials. In this review, we summarize recent breakthroughs in the development of gas&#8208;responsive membranes, outline the novel strategies on membrane fabrication, and highlight their advanced applications in controlled cargo release, size&#8208;/charge&#8208;based substance separation, oil&#8208;water separation, and self&#8208;cleaning. We also outlook the perspectives on the potential research directions and opportunities in the future.

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Benzyl&#8208;Naphthalimide Dyes Revealing Diverse Structural Evolution Dynamics at the Single&#8208;Assembly Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ real&#8208;time imaging of the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies were performed through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and their different growth modes were resolved. These results elucidate distinct structure and assembly dynamics of the three assemblies. This highlights the unique advantages of confocal microscopy in investigating assembly processes and kinetic analysis.








Abstract
Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for in situ monitoring of self&#8208;assembly dynamics providing critical insights into structural evolution and functional potential. However, the inherent complexity of supramolecular systems presents significant challenges for real&#8208;time visualization, particularly in capturing the growth kinetics of individual assemblies and the hierarchical formation of network structures at the single&#8208;assembly level. Here, we visualized the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In situ time&#8208;lapse imaging revealed distinct dynamic growth mechanisms among the three assemblies. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that different amino substituents significantly influenced assembly morphologies by modulating the planarity of the naphthalene ring. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging revealed pronounced intra&#8208;assembly heterogeneity, highlighting diverse molecular packing arrangements within individual assemblies. The confocal in situ visualization technique provided single&#8208;assembly growth dynamics, offering insights unattainable through conventional spectroscopic methods. Our work reveals that naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules can self&#8208;assemble into a variety of distinct architectures, underscoring their potential for designing advanced functional materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Aqueous Catalytic Olefin Polymerization With Nickel and Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions could yield considerable economic benefits. This review focuses on Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures.

Abstract
Polyolefins are extensively used in modern society, with hydrocarbon organic compounds traditionally serving as solvents for their preparation. Water, as a reaction medium, offers significant advantages, including non&#8208;flammability, non&#8208;toxicity, high specific heat capacity, and strong polarity. A promising avenue of research involves replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions, which could yield considerable economic benefits. Among the various transition metal catalysts used to synthesize polyolefins, late&#8208;transition metal catalysts, such as Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts, demonstrate enhanced tolerance to polar groups, making them particularly suitable for aqueous polymerization of olefins. This review focuses on the Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for the aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures. The preparation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocrystals and the modulation of polymer morphology are highlighted. The possible development trend of aqueous catalytic polymerization is envisioned to achieve the development concept of environmental protection and the needs of industrial production.

&lt;p&gt;Polyolefins are extensively used in modern society, with hydrocarbon organic compounds traditionally serving as solvents for their preparation. Water, as a reaction medium, offers significant advantages, including non-flammability, non-toxicity, high specific heat capacity, and strong polarity. A promising avenue of research involves replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions, which could yield considerable economic benefits. Among the various transition metal catalysts used to synthesize polyolefins, late-transition metal catalysts, such as Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts, demonstrate enhanced tolerance to polar groups, making them particularly suitable for aqueous polymerization of olefins. This review focuses on the Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for the aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures. The preparation of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocrystals and the modulation of polymer morphology are highlighted. The possible development trend of aqueous catalytic polymerization is envisioned to achieve the development concept of environmental protection and the needs of industrial production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Reversible Switching of Electronic Delocalization in a Linear Ru&#8211;Ru&#8211;Ru Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a molecular switch based on protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer reactions, in which electron configuration of 13+ can be switched between LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L and HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208; RuIILH.








Abstract
In this work, we report the first example of a molecular switch between electronic delocalization and electronic localization in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged trinuclear mixed&#8208;valence (MV) complex controlled by a protonation reaction. A MV complex with the terminal 2,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pyridine (L) ligand which has a higher proton&#8208;accepting character, LRuIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIIL (13+) was synthesized and well characterized. The investigations indicate that the interaction between the two terminal Ru centers of 13+ is so strong that it is fully delocalized and can be described as LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L. Most interestingly, 13+ can be reversibly protonated to 13+&#8208;2H coupled with an electron transfer from the central RuII to the terminal RuIII, resulting in a change in electronic structure from LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L to HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIILH. Cyclic voltammogram of 13+&#8208;2H showed very weak interaction between the two terminal Ru centers. The remarkable change in electronic states by protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer is also strongly supported by the (TD)DFT calculations. Complex 13+ may be potential for an excellent candidate of molecular switch.

         <title>Biodegradable Gel Blends with Enhanced Sensing Capabilities: SIO&#8322;&#8208;Based Innovations for Sustainable and Eco&#8208;Friendly Packaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable gelatin&#8208;based gel blends reinforced with SiO&#8322; and nanoclay exhibit enhanced mechanical strength, thermal stability, and ion&#8208;mediated structural integrity. These metal&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly materials open new opportunities for sustainable packaging.








Abstract
Biopolymer blends (GGs) derived from renewable plant or animal&#8208;based raw materials, hold significant potential for competing in the packaging industry by offering environmentally biodegradable and bioresorbable alternatives. One of the main challenges lies in optimizing the mechanical properties to enhance stress transfer between active additives and the gelatin matrices reinforced with modified SiO&#8322; compounds. In this study, a 5 &#176;C increase in the glass transition temperature and a fourfold improvement in tensile strength (reaching 12&#160;MPa) were achieved by incorporating hydrophilic SiO&#8322; nanoclay. Ion distribution maps visualized the interactions between silicon derivatives and polypeptide domains within the gel matrix, revealing increased stability attributed to ions such as Si+, SiO+, SiH+, and SiHO+. The absence of heavy metals in the blends underscores their potential as environmentally friendly and sustainable packaging solutions, with promising applications in sectors such as medical packaging.

         <title>Synthesis and Aggregation of Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and characterization of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide dyads with varying sterically demanding side groups. The dyads strongly assemble in basic aqueous solutions, resulting in fully quenched fluorescence. Tracking the individualization through tetrahydrofuran (THF) by UV/Vis spectroscopy revealed stronger porphyrin&#8208;porphyrin interactions for meso&#8208;free dyads. STEM and DLS measurements supported by DFT models reveal micellular structures, as well as larger liposomes and agglomerates.








Abstract
We report the straightforward synthesis of a family of amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) dyads containing sterically demanding substituents at the porphyrin meso&#8208;position, as well as at the PBI bay&#8208;position. The hydrophilic head group consists of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid G2&#8208;Newkome dendrons attached to the porphyrin, whereas lipophilic pentyl&#8208;hexyl&#8208;swallowtails are connected to the PBI imide position. Using UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, their tetrahydrofuran (THF) initiated disaggregation was studied in aqueous media. Without meso&#8208;substituents, a stronger interaction between the porphyrins was observed in the aggregated state. Insights into the size and morphology of the aggregates were obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these revealed micelles and liposomes as plausible architectures.

         <title>A Reprocessable Dynamic Disulfide Hydrogel for Capacitive Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel of an amphiphilic polyethylene glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative. The elastic hydrogel demonstrates decent mechanical properties and reprocessing capability. A microstructured capacitive sensor incorporating the hydrogel exhibits a decent sensitivity up to 1.14&#160;kPa&#8722;1, a fast response time within 20&#160;ms, and a robust stability.








Abstract
With the rapidly growing demand for wearable sensor devices across a range of applications, sensing technology has been rapidly advancing. However, challenges such as limited sensitivity, device instability, and trade&#8208;offs between performance and recyclability remain unaddressed. We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel from an amphiphilic polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative with hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics. The hydrogel demonstrates decent thermal stability and adequate mechanical properties, including elasticity, compressibility, and reprocessing capability. It is also integrated into a microstructured capacitive sensor, demonstrating a sensitivity of up to 1.14&#160;kPa&#8722;1, rapid response times within 20&#160;ms, and robust functioning stability up to 400 consecutive cycles. These properties make it particularly intriguing for the sustainable development of high&#8208;performance wearable sensors.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective deprotonation capture sequence of tetrahydroquinolines with alkyl halides and aromatic halides at the 4&#8208;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands is described. Mechanistic and site&#8208;selectivity investigations revealed the active metalation species to be a separated ion pair of which allowed for common directing groups within the heterocyclic scaffold to be bypassed.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4&#8208;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late&#8208;stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues.

     alt="Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4-Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general and selective deprotonation capture sequence of tetrahydroquinolines with alkyl halides and aromatic halides at the 4-position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands is described. Mechanistic and site-selectivity investigations revealed the active metalation species to be a separated ion pair of which allowed for common directing groups within the heterocyclic scaffold to be bypassed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4-position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross-coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late-stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues. The use of thorough mechanistic investigations revealed the aggregation state of the newly formed tetrahydroquinoline anion to be a separated ion pair, which proved critical to optimizing the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An elegant method described for the construction of fused pyrrole rings via palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of aryl iodides 10 with acetylenic substrates 8/9, leading to a general synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles 1 and pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles 2 through 11/12. Exposing 11/12 to 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) delivered nitrile substituted benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indoles 5 and indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles 6 under metal free conditions.








Abstract
We report an elegant method for the construction of fused pyrrole rings via palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of aryl iodides with N&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynylated 3&#8208;aminobenzofurans/3&#8208;aminoindoles leading to the general synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles/pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles via 3&#8208;(arylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro intermediates. Exposing the intermediates to 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) delivered benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (BFIs) and indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (IIs) containing vicinal cyano groups. These transformations constitute a rapid intermolecular assembly through several carbon&#160;&#8722;&#160;carbon bond forming reactions, involving a single electron transfer (SET) process in the crucial steps. Photophysical studies of selected products identified promising candidates for future applications.

         <title>Exploring the Modulation of the Complex Folding Landscape of Human Telomeric DNA by a Low Molecular Weight Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were utilized to investigate the complex G&#8208;quadruplex folding landscape of the human telomeric DNA in the presence of the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3. Our findings revealed significant differences in the kinetics of the pathways originating from the unfolded or K+&#8208;bound state.








Abstract
Telomeric DNA forms G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. These G4 structures are crucial for genomic stability and therapeutic targeting. Using time&#8208;resolved NMR and CD spectroscopy, we investigated how the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 modulates the folding of the human telomeric repeat 23TAG DNA. The kinetics are modulated by the ligand and by the presence of potassium cations (K+). Ligand binding to G4 occurs via a triphasic process with fast and slow phases. Notably, for the G4 structure in the presence of K+, the slow rate is ten times slower than without K+. These findings offer key insights into the modulation of the complex folding landscape of G4s by ligands, advancing our understanding of G4&#8208;ligand interactions for potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage for the Construction of Ketone Using Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an eco&#8208;firiendly photocatalytic protocol that achieves efficient C&#9472;C bond cleavage for synthesizing aromatic ketones and their derivatives. Employing molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant, the developed strategy eliminates the need for external oxidizing agents or transition metal catalysts, enabling sustainable bond scission under remarkably mild reaction conditions.









Abstract
The selective cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds by photocatalysis with the participation of oxygen for ketone synthesis and drug derivatization is reported. In this oxidation&#8208;based ketone formation reaction, molecular oxygen complexes with the substrate, which is subsequently photoexcited to generate a charge transfer (CT) state. This CT state facilitates energy transfer with molecular oxygen, producing singlet oxygen, which facilitates hydrogen atom process and promotes the subsequent cleavage of the carbon&#8211;carbon bond, ultimately leading to the formation of aryl ketone compounds. 48 aryl ketone compounds and pharmaceutical derivatives were synthesized using this method. A notable feature of this reaction is its catalyst&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free, and transition metals&#8208;free nature combined with green, mild, and environmentally friendly reaction conditions enabling high yields.

         <title>Impact of Octahedral Aluminum Sites on Guest Molecule Adsorption in Zeolites: A Computational Study of 5&#8208;Fluorouracil in Zeolite FAU</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the interaction of the anticancer drug 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) with a framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum site in a FAU&#8208;type zeolite. The calculations help to explain the experimental observation of a limited 5&#8208;FU release from zeolite samples containing such sites.








Abstract
Many aluminosilicate zeolites contain octahedral aluminum sites, which may occur as extra&#8208;framework or framework&#8208;associated sites. Due to the Lewis acidity of these sites, their impact on catalytic properties has been investigated frequently. Comparatively less emphasis has been placed on their role in adsorption, despite evidence for an irreversible binding of some guest molecules like the anticancer drug 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) to octahedral Al atoms. In the present study, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT&#8208;based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) are employed to investigate the adsorption of 5&#8208;FU at a framework&#8208;associated octahedral Al site in zeolite FAU. The calculations show that 5&#8208;FU remains coordinated to the Al atom at room temperature and in the presence of water. In contrast, 5&#8208;FU molecules adsorbed at framework protons are quickly displaced by water molecules. It is thus demonstrated that octahedral Al atoms will negatively affect the release of 5&#8208;FU from zeolite hosts in drug delivery applications. A comparison of DFT&#8208;calculated infrared (IR) spectra to literature data provides evidence that Al&#8208;coordinated 5&#8208;FU molecules were indeed present in previously investigated samples.

         <title>DOS&#8208;Like Strategy for the Spirocyclic MedChem Relevant Building Blocks via Petasis / Grubbs Reactions Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research has shown a strong potential for using a DOS&#8208;like approach on the building block level to generate novel perspective functionalized chemotypes. This potential was clearly demonstrated using a 2&#8208;step sequence, Petasis/Grubbs, to synthesize polyfunctional spiro compounds. In combination with standard parallel synthesis procedures from Enamine REAL, diverse 3D&#8208;shape blocks expand the chemical space to principally new directions.








Abstract
Through this model study, we showed broad perspectives on utilizing the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) like approach on the building block level in combination with well&#8208;developed methodologies for parallel synthesis for decoration and extension of ultra&#8208;large tangible chemical space to increase the speed and quality of drug discovery screening campaigns. This strategy led us to 16 novel Bemis&#8208;Murco scaffolds based on spirocyclic functionalized piperidines. The efficient, preparative, and scalable DOS&#8208;like approach to the above&#8208;mentioned motif was achieved by Petasis/Grubbs reactions sequence on a multigram scale. The chemoinformatically generated amide&#8208;based compound libraries demonstrated significant expansion of the chemical space of tangible compounds (on the example of Enamine's REAL database).

     alt="DOS-Like Strategy for the Spirocyclic MedChem Relevant Building Blocks via Petasis / Grubbs Reactions Sequence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has shown a strong potential for using a DOS-like approach on the building block level to generate novel perspective functionalized chemotypes. This potential was clearly demonstrated using a 2-step sequence, Petasis/Grubbs, to synthesize polyfunctional spiro compounds. In combination with standard parallel synthesis procedures from Enamine REAL, diverse 3D-shape blocks expand the chemical space to principally new directions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this model study, we showed broad perspectives on utilizing the diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) like approach on the building block level in combination with well-developed methodologies for parallel synthesis for decoration and extension of ultra-large tangible chemical space to increase the speed and quality of drug discovery screening campaigns. This strategy led us to 16 novel Bemis-Murco scaffolds based on spirocyclic functionalized piperidines. The efficient, preparative, and scalable DOS-like approach to the above-mentioned motif was achieved by Petasis/Grubbs reactions sequence on a multigram scale. The chemoinformatically generated amide-based compound libraries demonstrated significant expansion of the chemical space of tangible compounds (on the example of Enamine's REAL database).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategy&#8208;Level Prodrug Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic synthesis uniquely provides opportunities to access molecules that serve defined purposes. Medicinal chemistry illustrates this attribute well with prodrug design, whereby a drug undergoes a late&#8208;stage conversion to a conditionally responsive active medicinal agent (AMA), being a notable example. Prodrugs are becoming increasingly important in medicinal chemistry but common approaches to introduce biologically responsive groups are limited in the chemoselectivity and scope of available functionalization reactions. This Concept article describes strategy&#8208;level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site&#8208;selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group. Examples of functionalization using alkyne hydroaminations, Curtius reaction, and alkene metathesis are highlighted along with the use of the prodrugs for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage Intermolecular O&#8208;Peptidylation Protocol Enabled by Sequential Acyl Transfer on Thiol&#8208;incorporated Threonine Followed by Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thiol functionality on the methyl group of a threonine derivative [Thr(SH)] facilitates O&#8208;acylation of the Thr hydroxy group with a thioester. We previously showed that a Thr(SH)&#8208;incorporated peptide thioester can be converted to the corresponding Thr&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptide through intramolecular thioester exchange (S&#8722;S acyl transfer) and subsequent desulfurization of the O&#8208;acyl peptide resulting from intramolecular S&#8722;O acyl transfer. Based on our success in depsipeptide synthesis, we applied the Thr(SH)&#8208;facilitated protocol to the synthesis of branched O&#8208;acyl isopeptides. Initial attempts identified two issues. First, the S&#8208;acylation step with a thioester proceeds in an entropically preferential manner in cyclic depsipeptide synthesis, but not in the case of branched isopeptides. Using a highly volatile thiol component in the thioester solved this issue. Second, the intermolecular thioester change step was accompanied by the formation of an S,O&#8208;diacyl intermediate as a major component; this issue was solved by using thioester&#8208;selective activation of the diacyl species with silver(I) salt followed by desulfurization. Ultimately, the optimized Thr(SH)&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;acylation of a Thr residue in peptide sequences. We show that the protocol has wide substrate scope and demonstrate its application to ubiquitination of the Thr residue of HOIL&#8208;1 peptide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Evolution of Fluorescein into a Potential Theranostic Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in drug discovery and development have been marked by the emergence of new modalities, including small molecule theranostic agents. While initial results from clinical trials have been promising, modern detectable inhibitors are still in an early stage of development. In this study, we present a strategy for chemically evolving a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic entity, which not only retains its properties but also enhances its inhibition and detection applicability. By utilizing 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 as a model system, we leverage prior knowledge of its inhibitors to rationally functionalize fluorescein, enabling the targeted and highly efficient synthesis of over 20 derivatives across four different scaffolds. This approach ultimately led to the development of a potent, cell&#8208;permeable inhibitor that effectively engages its target in live cells and enables real&#8208;time visualization. These findings validate our new strategy for the development of small molecule diagnostic modulators, paving the way for application in other targets as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Enabled Pathway Complexity in Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathway complexity in supramolecular assemblies presents a unique opportunity for a single, relatively simple system to exhibit a wide range of properties, allowing for multifunctionality. In this study, we report redox&#8208;enabled pathway complexity in amino acid&#8208; functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) and its consequence for the macroscopic hydrogel network. We show that chemical reduction and subsequent oxidation enable a kinetically trapped state which transforms into different network morphologies in response to heat and time. Our finding that pathway complexity in supramolecular systems can alter bulk material properties suggests the potential for future development of dynamic materials that achieve multiple macroscopic functions with a single building block.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;production type Prussian Blue Analogues: a family of promising hosts for high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of high&#8208;performance, safe, and cost&#8208;effective multivalent&#8208;ion batteries is pivotal for sustainable energy storage. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), with their open framework and tunable redox&#8208;active sites, hold significant promise but face challenges in structural instability and sluggish ion diffusion. This review focuses on entropy production PBAs (EP&#8208;PBAs) for non&#8208;monovalent ion (Zn2+, Al3+, Mg2+, Ca2+) battery systems. Incorporating multiple transition metals into PBAs leverages entropy production effects to stabilize crystal structures, enhance ion diffusion kinetics, and improve cycling stability. Synthesis methods such as co&#8208;precipitation, electrochemical deposition, and hydrothermal techniques are compared, with co&#8208;precipitation emerging as the most scalable approach. Entropy engineering mitigates lattice distortion, reduces defects, and suppresses phase transitions, enabling EP&#8208;PBAs to achieve high specific capacities and long&#8208;term stability. Challenges including interfacial instability and synthesis complexity are discussed, alongside future directions in material optimization, electrolyte compatibility, and scalable production. This work highlights the potential of entropy&#8208;stabilized PBAs as next&#8208;generation cathodes for multivalent&#8208;ion batteries, advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>2D MOF Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Impedance Detector for Synergistic Biofilm Detection and Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of biofilm has become a significant influencing factor to microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Developing effective biofilm detection means are highly imperative for improving the efficiency of MFCs. In this study, we propose a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (2D Cu&#8208;BDC) nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for the simultaneous detection and removal of bacterial biofilms. The promising induction interface features good electron transfer and biofilm attachment properties, realizing sensitive biofilm detection. The impedance response change on the functionalized 2D MOF detector was 3.5 times higher for Gram&#8208;positive bacteria biofilm and 2.7 times higher for Gram&#8208;negative bacteria biofilm compared to bare electrodes. In addition, the 2D MOF nanozyme demonstrates robust peroxidase&#8208;like activity, enabling efficient biofilm degradation at low H2O2 concentration, and further allowing for real&#8208;time monitoring of the biofilm elimination process. This study provides a novel approach to using MOF&#8208;based biosensors for the simultaneous detection and removal of biofilm in MFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Asparagine as a Gatekeeper Residue in the Selective Binding of Rare Earth Elements by Lanthanide&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT) peptides selectively complex lanthanide cations (Ln3+) in their binding pockets and are promising for lanthanide separation. However, designing LBTs that selectively target specific Ln3+ cations remains a challenge due to limited molecular&#8208;level understanding and control of interactions within the lanthanide&#8208;binding pocket. Here, we reveal that the N5 asparagine residue acts as a gatekeeper in the binding pocket, resulting in a 100&#8208;fold selectivity for smaller Lu3+ over larger La3+ cations. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the N5 residue &#160;weakly binds to the larger La3+ cation, permitting H2O molecules inside the pocket. For the smaller Lu3+ cations, the N5 forms an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond with the E14 glutamic acid residue, locking the Lu3+ cation in the pocket and preventing H2O infiltration. Mutating the N5 asparagine to a D5 aspartic acid prevents such a hydrogen bond, eliminates the gatekeeping mechanism and precipitously reduces selectivity. The resulting binding affinity to Ln3+ cations is non&#8208;monotonic but generally increases with cation size. These results suggest a molecular design paradigm: the reduced affinity for larger lanthanides is due to open pocket conformations, while the selectivity of smaller Ln3+ cations over larger ones is due to the gatekeeping hydrogen bond.</dc:description>

         <title>An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group, combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a Ti(OEt)4/NaBH4 reductive system to achieve a one&#8208;pot condensation&#8208;reduction of the ketone&#8208;amino acid derivative with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di&#8208;amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid&#8208;mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;&#8208;lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; Liquids as Condensed&#8208;State Singlet Oxygen Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short&#8208;lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitiser into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi&#8208;component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids), non&#8208;volatile singlecomponent condensed&#8208;state fluidic materials, as photosensitisers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquidwater interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that are suitable for 1O2 production and analyse the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid photosensitisers. The alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of 1O2 production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate 1O2 within an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;talented Bismuthinidenes: Double C(sp3)&#8208;I Bond Activation Using Single or Two Bi Centers.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]Bi (1Dipp, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3) with CH2I2 proceeded via double C&#8208;I bond activation yielding [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,N)&#8208;CH2)I2 (3). By contrast, the reaction of 1Dipp with 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane provided [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]BiI2 (1DippI2) and ethene. The tert&#8208;butyl analogue [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi (1tBu) reacted with CH2ClX to give [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2Cl)X (X = I (4) or Cl (5)). Further, its reactivity with CH2I2 was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(I)}2(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,Bi)&#8208;CH2) (6) and [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2I)I (7). The reaction could be shifted in favor of 7 using an excess of CH2I2, but with 0.45 eq. of CH2I2 compound 6, as a product of double C&#8208;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir/Ni Metallaphotoredox Catalysis for the C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond &#945;&#8208;Arylation and Alkylation of N&#8208;Alkyl N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H bond &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles (carbazoles, indoles and indazoles) using a Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox catalysis. This approach enables the direct functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position of nitrogen heterocycles, offering an efficient alternative to traditional Sn2 methods and providing complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis, which often results in C(sp2)&#8211;H bond arylation. The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as the photocatalyst and NiCl2(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross&#8208;coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes, demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8208;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This new metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom&#8208;economical route to synthesizing valuable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Self&#8208;assembled Biomimetic Nanofibers for Light&#8208;Driven &#946;&#8208;lactam Antibiotics Degradation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overuse of antibiotics in China and the resulting rise in antibiotic resistance pose an urgent need for effective antibiotic degradation in water. Developing artificial systems that mimic the catalytic efficiency of natural photoactive enzymes for this purpose remains a critical challenge. Despite decades of research, there is a notable scarcity of precisely designed scaffolds that can replicate the structural and functional efficiency of natural enzymes for waterborne antibiotic degradation, particularly at the nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. In this study, we present a core&#8208;corona type fiber&#8208;like micellar system designed for photothermal&#8208;assisted &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic degradation (PAD) in water. This system integrates photothermal molecular chromophores (zinc porphyrin) and ionic copper degradation catalysts in close proximity within grafted solvophilic coronal chains on the surface of fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold. By employing a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) strategy, we fine&#8208;tune the composition, dimensions, and antibiotic degradation performance of the PAD nanofibers. The tailored colloidal stable PAD nanofibers achieve a penicillin G degradation rate of 0.35 min&#8208;1 per micromole of copper under simulated sunlight irradiation (A.M. 1.5) in deionized water, offering a promising platform for sustainable environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Anhydride&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Anthraquinones and Anthrones via Unusual Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triflic anhydride (Tf2O) is a potent electrophilic activator for carbonyl groups, facilitating the formation of versatile triflate intermediates that undergo nucleophilic trapping to generate a broad array of valuable compounds. In this work, we have developed a novel method that utilizes Tf2O as a mediator for carbonyl activation and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement of 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones 2 and anthrones 3. Both anthraquinones and anthrones are important molecules in the fields of natural products research, pharmaceuticals, and traditional chinese medicines. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed involving Tf2O&#8208;mediated activation, carbocation formation, nucleophilic addition, and intramolecular cyclization, ultimately leading to the formation of anthraquinones and anthrones. The developed methodology is both operationally simple and convenient, without the need for an inert atmosphere. This study broadens the scope of Tf2O utility and extends the practical application of intriguing intramolecular rearrangement to the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals and functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances In The Fixation of CO2 to form N&#8208;containing Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO2 as a C1 source for synthesizing N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO2 and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO2 conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds converted from CO2, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs via a Solid&#8208;Solution Storage Mechanism for Long&#160;Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The open&#8208;framework characteristics of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been recognized as advantages for cathode application in Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, lattice distortions during charge&#8208;discharge cycles critically compromise their cyclability. Recent advancements in high&#8208;entropy design strategies have significantly improved structural stability and energy storage efficiency within functional materials. In this study, we developed the high&#8208;entropy PBAs, K1.68Mn0.21Cu0.20Ni0.20Co0.19Fe0.20[Fe(CN)6]0.87&#9633;0.13&#183;0.66H2O, via a cost&#8208;effective aqueous coprecipitation protocol. Notably, this approach facilitates&#160;the concurrent incorporation of five transition metals (Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe), thereby establishing a stable crystalline framework. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates&#160;that the cathode achieves a specific capacity of 124.9 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 0.025 A g&#8722;1. At various current densities (0.025&#8208;1 A g&#8722;1), the cathode maintains&#160;a particular capacity retention&#160;of 62.1% during rate testing. Furthermore, the cathode exhibits&#160;exceptional cyclability, preserving 78.7% capacity at 1 A g&#8722;1&#160;after 3000 cycles. Operando&#160;X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms&#160;the formation of a reversible solid&#8208;solution intercalation/extraction mechanism process, which prevents phase transitions and enhances cyclability. This high&#8208;entropy material holds significant potential as a cathode for SIBs, offering high specific capacity and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability. These superior properties position it as a competitive candidate for advanced energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) triflate/ Vitamin&#8208;C Promoted Modified Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Annulation: A Facile Route to Fluorescent Cyclopentene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a rapid and efficient method for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids via Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (IMBH) annulation. In this approach, copper triflate (Cu(OTf)&#8322;) serves as the promoter, favoring cyclization and aromatization over the conventional MBH addition product. A characteristic feature among most of the cyclized product contain two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixture of cyclopentene derivatives which has been readily interconverted via 1,5&#8208;H shift. Additionally, the same compounds have also been synthesized in solvent&#8208;free conditions using organic acids, which reduces the use of hazardous substances, providing an alternate pathway for the IMBH reaction. Moreover, this novel IMBH reaction has been thoroughly investigated and elucidated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The construction of such fluorescent derivatives and the evaluation of their unique photophysical properties revealed acid&#8208;base interactions with active methylene groups, facilitating their use as sensors of hazardous amine derivatives via fluorescence quenching mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Peripheral Designed Indigo Bola&#8208;Amphiphiles for Supramolecular Assembled Nanoarchitectonics in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigo, an ancient natural dye, featured excellent biodegradability to advance in sustainable polymer. Indigo amphiphiles can pave a way for sustainable supramolecular polymers in aqueous media for potential biomedical functional materials. However, contemporary indigo amphiphiles supramolecular commonly assemble into low aspect ratio nanostructures, which hampers the macroscopic soft scaffolds fabrications and smart functional material applications. Herein, we report a novel peripheral designed indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs), which assemble into high aspect ratio supramolecular nanofibers in aqueous media. By employing shear&#8208;flow assembly technique with bio&#8208;abundant calcium ions, IBAs assemble across multiple length&#8208;scales into supramolecular macroscopic scaffolds. The structural characterizations of IBAs macroscopic soft scaffolds show different supramolecular structural packing information by scanning electron microscope and X&#8208;ray scattering/diffraction techniques. Our supramolecular nanoarchitectonic approach indicates the feasibility of using IBAs molecular design to construct supramolecular macroscopic materials with higher structural order for the future smart bio&#8208;functional materials and sustainable supramolecular polymer under more environmentally friendly conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stannylenes Bearing an Amino&#8208;Linked NHC Ligand as Efficient Catalysts for Hydroboration of Carbonyls and Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized a series of three&#8208;coordinated stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand, specifically tailored for the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds and imines. To fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance both sterically and electronically, various substituents (chloro, triflate, and bis(trimethylsilyl)amino groups) were introduced at the tin center, generating structurally diverse stannylenes. The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds catalyzed by these stannylenes proceeded under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding boryl esters in excellent yields with high chemoselectivity. Notably, bis(trimethylsilyl)aminostannylene exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency, enabling hydroboration with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% for aldehydes and 0.1 mol% for ketones, and was tolerant of a wide range of substrates, including sterically hindered and electronically diverse carbonyl compounds.&#12288;Furthermore, in the hydroboration of imines, the reaction proceeded efficiently with just 5 mol% catalyst, furnishing the corresponding borylamines in high yields. Based on stoichiometric experiments, we propose a plausible catalytic cycle for stannylene&#8208;mediated hydroboration.</dc:description>

In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective g&#8208;values and zero field splittings of the energetically low&#8208;lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial g&#8208;tensor for SMM behaviour and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low&#8208;lying excited states.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This report employs computational methods at unified levels of theory to systematically and comprehensively examine the respective transmetalation mechanisms underpinning classical palladium&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8211;Csp2 and Csp2&#8211;Csp3 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. This approach enabled fundamental aspects of these transmetalation pathways to be directly juxtaposed, which allowed for subtle, but important, features underpinning the transmetalation mechanisms of archetypal arylboronic acid and B&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane nucleophiles to be highlighted and placed in a broader context.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Station&#8208;less Molecular Daisy Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A daisy chain architecture without a preferred low energy arrangement of the mechanically linked components is presented. The molecular design combines a rigid&#8208;rod type oligophenylene ethynylene subunit with an oligoethylene glycol macrocycle that features a bipyridine coordination site. The daisy chain dimer was synthesized via kinetic trapping of the interlocked structure using a Cadiot&#8208;Chodkiewicz active metal template reaction. Comparison of the isolated interlocked dimer with its monomeric analogue indicates the presence of a variety of different geometries for the molecular daisy chain. The dynamic sliding motion in the daisy chain is studied by variable temperature UV&#8208;vis and NMR spectroscopy experiments, which point to a highly mobile system even at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Developing Activity&#8208;Based Luminescent Probes for Imaging and Diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have experienced a concerning global increase in incidence over recent decades. The advent of molecular imaging probes has revolutionized real&#8208;time biomarker monitoring in IBD pathophysiology, enabling visualization of critical pathological processes. These probes provide dynamic insights into oxidative stress mediators (including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and enzymatic biomarkers (e.g., caspase&#8208;1, pantetheinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, nitroreductase, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and carboxylesterase 2), which are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Despite significant technological advancements, there remains a lack of systematic analyses exploring the diagnostic potential and therapeutic monitoring applications of these molecular probes in IBD management. This review comprehensively analyzes the design of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes targeting IBD&#8208;specific biomarkers, with particular focus on their detection mechanisms and biological applicability. Through a mechanistic elucidation of detection paradigms, this review aims to guide the development of future probes for diagnosing IBD.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Folding of a Two&#8208;Chain Protein Having Three Interchain Disulfide Bonds. Synthesis of Bromelain Inhibitor VI through Native Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently renovated two&#8208;chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different&#8208;type two&#8208;chain protein, i.e., bromelain inhibitor VI (BI&#8208;VI), which has abundant &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)&#8208; and light (L)&#8208;chains of BI&#8208;VI were mixed at 4 &#176;C in a pH 10.0 buffer solution containing 2 mM GSH and 0.4 mM GSSG, native BI&#8208;VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53 %) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI&#8208;VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non&#8208;activity. The rate&#8208;limiting step of the two&#8208;chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three&#8208;SS intermediates of the H&#8208;chain (3SSH) and one&#8208;SS intermediates of the L&#8208;chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multi&#8208;chain proteins with more complicated SS&#8208;bond topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>The Energetics of Electron Transfer in Redox&#8208;DNA Layers Mimics that of Redox Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;DNA layers have recently shown unique properties, such as tunable reorganization energy of electron transfer that can be modulated by DNA length or hybridization state, and completely suppressed under nanoconfinement. These discoveries, attributed to the changes in the solvation of the redox marker and/or fast chain dynamics, provide a unique opportunity to use electrochemical measurements as a tool to address open questions in ion solvation. Moreover, they offer a pathway to clarify the origin of the largely unsolved problem of establishing low activation barriers for biological electron transfer. Here, high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate, variable&#8208;temperature cyclic voltammetry, analyzed using the Marcus formalism and molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that the total free energy barrier of electron transfer consists of two additive elements: the reorganization energy of the partially desolvated redox marker and the energy cost for solvation changes of the redox marker at the solid/liquid interface. These results may have profound implications for our understanding of electron transfer and solvation effects in redox proteins, providing opportunities for better design of artificial photosynthetic systems, biosensing, and energy conversion devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Splitting Without Barrier or Visible Light&#8208;Driven: Reactions of Vanadium Trimers and Dimers with Dinitrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix&#8208;isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers towards dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V2 and V3 react by cleavage of the N2 triple&#8208;bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V3 reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix&#8208;deposition, the reaction of V2 requires the activation by visible&#8208;light irradiation. There is evidence for two isomers of V2N2, a planar one with a 5Au electronic term and long V&#8722;V distance and a folded one with a 1A1 term and a short V&#8722;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V2 and V3 with N2 containing activated N2 units.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic switches of DNA glycosylase OGG1 catalyze a highly efficient AP&#8208;lyase function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>8&#8208;oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8&#8208;oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pKa is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches &#8208; 4&#8208;anilino pyridines and 6&#8208;anilino pyrimidines &#8208; which are dimethyl&#8208;amino&#8208;pyridine (DMAP) type Br&#248;nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) and electron&#8208;donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pKa less or equal to the assay pH, is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC50 13 nM, pKa 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient&#8208;derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt or cocrystal puzzle solved by mechanochemistry: the role of solvent in the pamoic acid case study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many drugs are nowadays marketed as salts. Cocrystallization is also emerging as a convenient tool to modify in vivo activity of pharmacologically active compounds. Given the marked difference in physicochemical properties between salts and cocrystals, the possibility of obtaining crystalline systems composed of the same building blocks in their neutral or charged form is desirable. Pamoic acid is widely used in pharmaceutical formulation as pamoate salt, and we here propose a unique synthetic strategy to obtain a cocrystal of pamoic acid rather than a salt by tuning mechanochemical conditions. Our findings have been corroborated by means of computational analyses, relating to&#160;the noncovalent interactions in the crystal structure with the formation of the different crystalline forms. A detailed analysis of the structure containing pamoic acid in its neutral, anionic or dianionic form present in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) helped generalizing our results.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Access of Heterocycles Utilizing Inherent Carbodicationic Reactivity of Ynone via Lewis Acid Catalysed C&#8208;C Triple bond Cleavage.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent carbodicationic synthon has attracted significant attention due to its unique reactivity and bonding. The application of this synthon in synthetic settings is still fancy owing to its super&#8208;electrophilicity. Generation of this reactive intermediate in a catalytic fashion is challenging. For the first time, the reactivity of divalent dication has been realised&#160;via&#160;Lewis acid&#8208;catalysed heterolytic ionisation of ynone via sequential conjugate addition to ynone followed by C&#8208;C bond cleavage to afford heteroarenes. A library of quinazolinones and 2&#8208;substituted quinazolinones have been synthesised with good to excellent yields, having a wide range of functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope using 2&#8208;amino benzamides as a nucleophilic partner. Furthermore, 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes afforded the corresponding benzimidazole in synthetically good yield. The generality of this strategy has been demonstrated by the successful synthesis of 6&#8208;mono&#160;and 2,6&#8208;di&#160;substituted quinazolinones and 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted quinazoline with very high efficiency. The mechanistic study confirmed the role of the cooperative effect and secondary orbital interaction in grob&#8208;type fragmentation and not the involvement of any radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Amination of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone&#8208;type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a groundbreaking strategy for the in&#8208;situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post&#8208;treatment. Characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal that the passive Cu2O film formed on the symmetrical Cu electrodes under AC electrolysis continuously generates Cu+, which is crucial for the reaction. This approach is scalable, environmentally friendly, and holds great potential for industrial applications, offering substantial economic benefits while reducing environmental impact.</dc:description>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Lactam Ylidenes: an Overlooked Class of N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the underappreciated class of &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is revisited and systematically explored. The required precursors are available in a highly modular synthetic approach from simple starting materials. Two routes may be followed for the generation of the free BLCs: thermal fragmentation of spiro&#8208;fused oxadiazoles (110 &#176;C, toluene), or deprotonation of carbene HCl&#8208;adducts at &#8208;80 &#176;C with a strong base. TEP values (2065&#8208;2072 cm&#8208;1), 77Se NMR shifts of selenium&#8208;adducts (812&#8208;995 ppm) as well as DFT calculations reveal moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of BLCs, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity. The formation of a wide variety of products under thermal conditions in the cause of oxadiazole fragmentation (110 &#176;C, toluene) is rationalized by a combination of computational reaction discovery and experimental validation. Products include olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers arising from bimolecular reactions, while sterically more demanding precursors are converted in a monomolecular fragmentation reaction via CO release to form ketenimines as intermediates, which finally form amides. With substituents providing appropriate steric protection, a persistent BLC is available via the low temperature route, characterized by its 13C NMR shift of 287 ppm at &#8208;20 &#176;C.</dc:description>

With substituents providing appropriate steric protection, a persistent BLC is available via the low temperature route, characterized by its 13C NMR shift of 287 ppm at -20 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Very Readily Prepared Ligand for Rhodium Catalysed Propene Hydroformylation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make ligand that would lead to Rh catalysts that give very rare preferential formation of&#160;iso&#8208;butanal from propene hydroformylation,&#160;bis&#8208;phosphonites and&#160;bis&#8208;phosphoramidites were designed. Catalysts derived from&#160;bis&#8208;phosphonites gave the desired low&#160;n:isoratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis.&#160;A&#160;bis&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh&#8208;catalysed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Infra&#8208;Red spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000 mol/mol in one hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most&#160;iso&#8208;selective example, had a partially flexible&#160;n:iso&#160;ratio depending on temperature and pressure. Two Pt(II) complexes were prepared and their X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined.&#160;The most&#160;iso&#8208;selective catalyst was examined at low temperature(prioritising&#160;iso&#8208;selectivity over rates) in hydroformylation of some other terminal alkenes with significant branched selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Conclusive Insight into the Coordination Complexes of a Flexible Bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) Ligand and their Phase&#8208;dependent Structure: a Multi&#8208;technique Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin&#8208;free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8211;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3&#8208;phenylene bridge (H2bdhb = 1,3&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1&#8208;hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb2&#8211; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)2(bdhb)2] (1) and [Co2(bdhb)2(py)4] (2), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb2&#8211; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi&#8208;macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn2+ analogue of 1 and 2, namely [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] (3). Although both 2 and 3 are dimeric and contain the same ligands, 3 features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI&#8208;MS spectra of 3 in THF and CH2Cl2&#160;contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on J&#8208;coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of 3 into quasi&#8208;macrocyclic monomers in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2 solution at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation using bidentate phosphines: How the stereochemistry of the ligand affects the catalyst's activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order is confirmed by the computed apparent Gibbs free energy barrier (57.7, 79.7, and 91.4 kJ mol&#8208;1, respectively). The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to its higher stability compared to the hydride complex and lower stability compared to the CO complex, in contrast to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of the cis&#8208;Eunicellane Cyclase AriE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Eunicellane diterpenoids, with over 360 known examples characterized by a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;6/10&#8208;bicyclic carbon skeleton, exhibit diverse biological activities. To date, five eunicellane cyclases (ECs) have been reported: cis&#8208;ECs (Bnd4, CpDTS2 and EcTPS1) and trans&#8208;ECs (AlbS and MicA), yet the structural basis and molecular mechanisms governing their distinct cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;cyclization modes remain unsolved. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cis&#8208;EC AriE from Amycolatopsis arida, which catalyzes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form cis&#8208;6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene (1) in aridacin biosynthesis. Through surface entropy reduction, we obtained the 1.87 &#197; resolution structure of AriED128A. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis identified W73 as a key regulatory hotspot controlling product diversity, with its variants generating diverse diterpene products. Y203A converted AriE into a highly specific (&#8211;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;cembrene A synthase. Our findings provide the first structural insights into this type of terpene synthase and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering EC variants for selective product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies towards synthesis and conversion of lignin model compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The push towards a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature and what the product streams identified are. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihalogens Binding and Activation by Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Chalcogenone Model Derivatives: Insight from a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline&#8208;based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X = Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI) and a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY). The halogen and chalcogen effects are discussed separately as for the solvation effects. Furthermore, only the TY species formed from the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione and I2 resulted to be disfavored with respect to the corresponding CT adduct; therefore, this peculiarity is rationalized in the framework of activation strain analysis. Lastly, a possible alternative mechanism involving the formation of a cationic intermediate species is considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance the surface reactivity of Mo&#8208;based TMD monolayers &#8211; MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 &#8211; but also amplify differences in their physicochemical properties, leading to distinct surface interactions. This effect originates from the intrinsic characteristics of Mo&#8211;X bonding in these monolayers.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of 

MoS2

 ${{\rm{MoS}}_2 }$



, 

MoSe2

 ${{\rm{MoSe}}_2 }$



, and 

MoTe2

 ${{\rm{MoTe}}_2 }$



, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and 

NO2

 ${{\rm{NO}}_2 }$



. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of Ag&#8208;based electrode with the highly exposed and tightly contacted AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) active facets was constructed for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work can help understand the effects of crystal orientation and crystal face interface on electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x=0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 456&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>

We present a bivalent iridium(III) complex toolkit for targeting mitochondrial DNA Gquadruplexes, which has the merits of multicolor, ability to discriminate TNBC cells and modular phototheranostics.







Abstract
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4&#8197;s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, where complex 3 exhibited a type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.

         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method is developed for the hydrofunctionalization of olefins, involving TEMPO adduct formation followed by photocatalytic nucleophilic substitution. This approach enables the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bonds with high efficiency. The method demonstrates potential for PET applications with hydrofluorination and offers an alternative pathway to diastereoselective olefin hydration.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.

         <title>Reusable CuO NPs Catalyzed Chemodivergent Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes and Aniline Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy to synthesize CuO NPs catalyzed effective chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to aniline derivatives and hydrazoarenes under mild conations using ammonia borane is demonstrated. A series of control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were carried out to understand the catalytic process. Furthermore, the catalyst was recycled up to six consecutive cycles with no significant decrease in catalytic activity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of different products from a substrate employing a single catalyst by altering the reaction conditions is challenging. Herein, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and cheap CuO NPs catalyzed chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes and aniline derivatives using ammonia borane (AB) under mild conditions is disclosed. The practical applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrazo and aniline derivatives as well as by the reduction of a few commercially used dyes such as methyl red, sudan I, sudan III and solvent yellow 7. Several control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Accelerating Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand Displacement Reaction using Polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) is an effective accelerator for toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. PQ2 improves reaction rates by up to 105&#8208;fold and alleviates dependence on toehold length, mitigates secondary structure's influences, and ensures robust performance in serum. PQ2 offers a promising solution for advancing applications of DNA nanotechnology, from biosensing to molecular computing.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially for low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator of TMSD reaction. We show that PQ2 could drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold. Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with sub&#8208;nanomolar input has been demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic DNA amplifiers. By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations, PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes. The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride with Cerium&#8208;Aluminum Catalytic Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a cerium&#8208;aluminum bimetallic catalyst is fired using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, and a modified carbon fabric anode is created. Electrochemical degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride without additional oxidizing agents shows excellent results. Simultaneously, several cycle degradation studies yield outstanding results, and a degradation mechanism was presented by characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85&#8201;% removal efficiency of DOX within 2&#8197;hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82&#8201;%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8211;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene (AB) is a promising light&#8208;responsive motif for targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) and enabling their light&#8208;controlled modulation. We synthesized a series of novel AB derivatives with diverse structural variations, demonstrating that the interaction mode influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings highlight critical design principles for optimizing photoactive G4 ligands.







Abstract
During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4&#8197;s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.

         <title>The Chemistry of Anticancer Mononuclear and N&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Half&#8208;sandwich Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
8&#8208;Aminoquinoline half&#8208;sandwich metal chlorido complexes were found to undergo conversion into dimetallic analogues under basic conditions and/or by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were found to be in general more potent than the mononuclear analogues which can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells.







Abstract
Piano&#8208;stool complexes of ruthenium and other platinum group metals have shown promising preclinical results as anticancer agents, often with alternative modes of action to traditional platinum&#8208;based compounds. Quinoline is considered a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and many complexes with potent anticancer activity have been reported. To assess the effect of incorporating bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQH) ligands in half&#8208;sandwich piano&#8208;stool metal complexes of the general formula [M(L)(AQH)Cl]+, the respective Ru, Os (L=&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene), Rh and Ir (L=&#951;5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes were prepared. Deprotonation of AQH during the reaction gave dinuclear [M(L)(AQ)]22+ complexes with the deprotonated &#956;&#8208;&#954;1N&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinolinato&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQ) ligands acting as bridges between the metal centers. Conversion of the mononuclear Ru, Rh and Ir compounds to the dimetallic analogues was facilitated under basic conditions and improved for the Ru derivative by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were in general more potent than mononuclear analogues. The higher activity of the dimetallic compounds can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells, as demonstrated for the respective Ru complexes, while zebrafish embryo studies demonstrated low toxicity, irrespective of the number of metal centers in the complexes.

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.&#8201;e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Organic Batteries using Renewable Biomolecule&#8208;Based Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based molecule (emodin) have been utilized for the first time as cathode in rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), exhibiting high specific capacity and excellent diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) exhibit significant potential in large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their features of high volumetric capacity, resistance to dendrite formation, and abundant magnesium resources. However, the high polarity of divalent Mg2+ ions results in sluggish diffusion kinetics in conventional inorganic cathode materials, adversely affecting reversible capacity and rate performance. Organic materials such as pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrone (PTO) and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), achieve rapid and reversible intercalation of magnesium ions through carbonyl enolization, but these materials are challenged by high cost, complex preparation, and poor environmental friendliness. In this study, we employ a carbonyl&#8208;rich biomass&#8208;based small molecule, emodin, as a cathode material for RMBs, achieving rapid diffusion kinetics and notable magnesium storage performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using biomass materials to prepare high&#8208;performance cathodes for RMBs and provides a novel approach for the development of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials.

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a 2nd sphere hydrogen bond donor in iron complexes induces the selection of a specific FeIIIOOH species in the presence of H2O2 thanks to the stabilizing H&#8208;bonding interaction with the proximal O. This structural pattern, after OO bond cleavage, enhances the electrophilicity of the resulting high valent oxo species, which improves epoxidation yields.







Abstract
Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo&#8208;containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis&#8208;zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the E to the Z configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.







Abstract
Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the plier can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the rotor.

Crystal structures of Cu&#8208;MOF: by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photochromic ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photochromic copper&#8208;based MOF using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photochromic ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture (see picture). The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;stimulated Polymers have garnered significant attention for their potential applications ranging from optical memory to sensing. Herein, by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photo&#8208;stimulated ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photo&#8208;stimulated copper&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;MOF) using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture, offering a distinct advantage over previously reported 1D coordination polymer using similar photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor. Its electrochemical performance revealed high reversibility, with discharge capacities retaining stability under varying current densities. Additionally, the Cu&#8208;MOF displayed notable photo&#8208;stimulated behavior under UV light irradiation, enhancing its optical properties. Although the structure changes from 1D coordination polymer to 3D MOF, the photocyclized form (c&#8208;Cu MOF) still exhibited superior fluorescence quenching efficiency and sensitivity for MnO&#8324;&#8722; detection with Ksv (quenching constant) 5.24&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. This work highlights the utility of Cu&#8208;MOF as a multifunctional material for energy storage and environmental sensing applications.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation by improving stability and scalability. Through topotactic proton replacement with metal ions in bpy&#8208;pillared zincophosphates, a bimetal phosphate, VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w, was developed, showing exceptional stability (pH 2&#8211;12, boiling water). A rapid synthesis reduced production time to 3&#8197;hours, with vanadyl groups providing strong sheets and metal sites for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8901;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH&#8197;2&#8208;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48&#8197;hours to just 3&#8197;hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.

         <title>Box&#8208;like Molecules&#8208;Induced Discrete Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Aramide Macrocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
Specific ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembly is achieved using box&#8208;like molecules and hydrogen bonded aramide macrocycle through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions, revealing the importance of the effect of molecular structures and conformational adaptivity upon the assembling outcome.







Abstract
The controlled formation of ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) assemblies is highly desirable as precursors for constructing higher order supramolecular architectures. We report our findings that this goal can be achieved by balancing molecular structures and conformational adaptivity through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions. With hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules including naph&#8208;Box, m&#8208;Box and p4p&#8208;Box, ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling systems with 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry are preferentially created. The formation of such assemblies with a defined number of rings threaded on a Box molecule is unprecedented using 2D shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles. The unusual assembly behaviors are rationalized by the aid of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and xTB computation. In sharp contrast to the use of o&#8208;Box and p&#8208;Box in forming ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings complexes where a distribution of various assembled species is observed, the box&#8208;like molecules all afford monodisperse compact assemblies. Conformational adaptivity is deemed as one of the major factors that is accountable for the selectivity observed, which is driven mainly by cooperative action of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions including H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Using pyrimidyl&#8208;incorporated H&#8208;bonded macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling structures may provide opportunities for designing more sophisticated and topologically unique supramolecular systems with potential functions.

         <title>Tuning Decomposition Temperature: A Structural Study of Ligand Directed Bonding and Fluxionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

In this work, we have investigated the design and synthesis of aluminium compounds via systematic variation of ligand type. This is the first example of a ligand directed design and study of aluminium compounds which decompose at low temperatures (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C). Their dynamic properties have also been investigated, with a focus on the decomposition profiles.







Abstract
In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#8201;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8722;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8722;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R=Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8722;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14. This has directly been linked to the decomposition profiles of the compounds to assess their viability as precursors, evidencing that what we see in the solution state is present in the solid state too. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to elucidate the various bonding modes observed for compounds 1&#8211;7. Tandem MS has been employed to better understand the breakdown of the molecules.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Conjugation of Inorganic Phosphate and Sulfate with Aminocyclobutenediones under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation of aminocyclobutenediones with blue light in aqueous phosphate or sulfate solution produces butenolides with phosphate or sulfate groups. The reaction is compatible with free amino and carboxy groups, and can be performed under air.







Abstract
Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented. In this study, we have successfully conjugated inorganic phosphate and sulfate with aminocyclobutenedione derivatives via photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. A plausible mechanism for the conjugation reactions was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations. These reactions will promote life science research based on organophosphates and organosulfates which have been difficult to access up to now.

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;Shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;Free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes by templating with Ag nanocubes via one&#8208;shot injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution and H2O2 etching. We also extend the one&#8208;shot synthesis from a batch to a continuous flow reactor for continuous production without compromising the quality.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of Pd-based nanoframes by templating with Ag nanocubes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; one-shot injection of Pd(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; etching. We also extend the one-shot synthesis from a batch to a continuous flow reactor for continuous production without compromising the quality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble-metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd-based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core-frame nanocubes and then Pd-based nanoframes through one-shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PdCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, preventing self-nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd-based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; one-shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large-scale production of Pd-based nanoframes with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; etching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Working Mechanisms for Enhanced Interface Stability and Electrochemical Properties in Dual&#8208;Salt Polymer Electrolyte with In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte&#8208;Cathode Integration</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;salt CSEs with electrolyte&#8208;cathode integrated structure is obtained via in&#8208;situ UV photopolymerization. The working mechanisms of a stable, robust and low&#8208;resistance SEI layer can be revealed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterization. The dual&#8208;salt CSEs show an enhanced performance for all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li||Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2&#8201;% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000&#8197;h at at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2@0.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4||Li cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C after 100 cycles) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;Heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy adsorption separation method is proposed, which uses cucurbit[7]uril to efficiently separate toluene from toluene/n&#8208;heptane mixture with a purity of 99.65&#8201;% and can be reused, providing an innovative solution for the efficient utilization of petroleum resources.







Abstract
Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38&#8201;% from the mixed vapors and 99.65&#8201;% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.

Two model catalysts, those are, Pd1@NaY with conjuct Pd center and Lewis acid sites, and Pd1@NaY&#8722;T with isolated Pd centers are synthesized and compared their catalytic performance for oxidative carbonylation reaction. Combined in&#8208;situ DRIFTS, and DFT calculation study reveals the cooperation mechanism of Pd and Lewis acid sites towards the carbonate products.







Abstract
Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in&#8197;situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate significant potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. This work systematically evaluates four synthesis strategies &#8211; solvothermal, microwave, ultrasonic, and mechanochemical &#8211; to optimize TAPT&#8208;COF preparation, showing how different synthesis methods influence COF properties, and providing valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30&#8197;min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, decomposition of solvents and sacrificial agents leads to CH4 production rather than CO2 reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed that acetone, DMSO, and TEA decompose to produce CH4 at rates as high as 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.

Self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode materials with vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies were prepared by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method, and synergistically interacted with SnO&#8322;&#8208;modified SnO&#8322;/CNTs anode materials to successfully construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors. The V&#8208;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs device exhibits an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 151 Wh/kg at a current density of 3 A/g and maintain 96.2% capacity stability after 10000 charge/discharge cycles.







Abstract
In this work, we present for the first time an innovative strategy to construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors through the synergistic optimization of vanadium&#8208;doped self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional Flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anodes and SnO&#8322;/CNTs composite anodes. The V&#8208;doped Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode synthesized by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method combines vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies, lattice distortion effects and self&#8208;supporting properties of the three&#8208;dimensional floral structure, which enhances the specific surface area of the material to 190.58&#8197;m2/g, and obtains a high specific capacitance of 2,157&#8197;F/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g, and undergoes a 15&#8197;A/g After 10,000 cycles at 15&#8197;A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still 98.2&#8201;%. To address the limitations of traditional anode materials, SnO&#8322;/CNTs composites significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance (5.61&#8197;&#937;) and enhance the multiplicity performance by combining the high theoretical capacity of SnO&#8322; with the three&#8208;dimensional conductive network of CNTs. Based on this, the V&#8722;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs hybrid supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 151&#8197;Wh/kg at 3&#8197;A/g, which is a 30&#8211;60&#8201;% enhancement over the conventional molybdate capacitor, and maintains 96.2&#8201;% capacitance stability after 10,000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the development of energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycle life.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Development of a Covalent Inhibitor Targeting Streptococcus Pyogenes over Staphylococcus Aureus Sortase A</title>

The rational design of a selective SpSrtA inhibitor was guided by structural insights from the ML346/SpSrtA structure and the docked ML346/SaSrtA model. Our analysis revealed that head and tail clashes in the binding pocket indicated that reducing the &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in ML346 could enhance selectivity for SpSrtA over SaSrtA. Through our SAR study, we identified T10 as a promising narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agent for combating S.&#8197;pyogenes infection.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10&#8242;s covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: The Missing Link in the 3&#8201;d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

Covalent or Lewis&#8208;Pair? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; and Mn2(CO)10 yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)10]+. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis&#8208;pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.







Abstract
The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Covalent or Lewis-Pair&lt;/b&gt;? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis-pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt; with half an equivalent of Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single-crystal X-Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;} fragments in [MnFe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was prepared as its [PPN]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cage complex is presented that mimics the CuD site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). The CuD site has recently been proposed to be the activite site of pMMO. The cage complex presented here can catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones.







Abstract
The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase (pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD site with two histidines and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Salen&#8208;Type Chromium Complexes for Selective Carbonylation of Epoxides: A Pathway to Polyesters and Cyclic Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates epoxide carbonylation using salen&#8208;type complexes with Co2(CO)8 to optimize the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) favoured polyesters, while [ONNO]&#8208;type Cr(III) and Al(III) favoured cyclic lactones. Ethylene oxide carbonylation highlighted the role of catalyst structure, with the [ONNO] type achieving &gt;99% propiolactone selectivity. The results emphasize the influence of ligand design on selectivity, thus facilitating the development of catalytic systems.







Abstract
Carbonylation, a pivotal process in efficient C1 conversion, facilitates the direct incorporation of carbon monoxide into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. This study investigates the carbonylation of epoxides using salen&#8208;type complexes with varying metal centers and tetradentate dianionic ligands, in conjunction with Co2(CO)8, to optimize selectivity and yield in the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. The [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) complexes exhibited a pronounced preference for polyester formation, achieving a selectivity of 73&#8201;%. This preference is attributed to the electron&#8208;donating sulfur donors, which stabilize the growing polymer chain. In contrast, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) predominantly yielded cyclic lactones (99&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone selectivity), owing to their enhanced electrophilicity that favors the backbiting process. Detailed analyses of ethylene oxide carbonylation underscored the crucial role of catalyst structure in determining reaction pathways and product distribution. Notably, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) exhibited over 99&#8201;% propiolactone selectivity during the carbonylation of ethylene oxide, highlighting the significance of catalyst design in optimizing chemical reactions. These results provide valuable insights into the role of ligand design in controlling the selectivity and efficiency of epoxide carbonylation, paving the way for the development of more effective catalytic systems.

Can hypergolic ionic liquid &#8211; oxidizer combination be universal green propellant? Comprehensive experimental study exploiting droplet merging technique inside an acoustic levitator process chamber reveals such feasibility via comparing the hypergolic and atmospheric ignition reactions through the identification of products and reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternatives to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8901;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8901;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, Au&#8722;Pd Janus particle and Au+Pd mixture catalysts with different configurations were prepared to selectively oxidize GLY toward DHA, in which AuPd/CNT catalyst with the strongest interaction between the Au and Pd atoms afforded the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms. That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Au atoms remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au, resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly. After optimizing, up to 61&#8201;% yield of DHA was achieved at 87&#8201;% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.

It was due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Au atoms remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au, resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly. After optimizing, up to 61&#8201;% yield of DHA was achieved at 87&#8201;% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowest&#8208;lying excited states of the TTM&#8208;derived diradicals cannot be related to those of TTM: new low&#8208;lying excited states emerge, corresponding to charge resonance between the two radical units, the lowest one being a dark state for symmetric diradicals. Different approaches than those used for TTM radicals are needed to achieve high PLQY in TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.







Abstract
The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is characterized by the H,H&#8594;L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogs with shifted double bonds were synthesized and together with the known analog iso&#8208;GGPP I converted with 14 diterpene synthases. While two substrate analogs were not accepted by the enzymes, the other three analogs yielded compounds with skeletons that are not observed in nature. Mechanistic key steps were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and computational chemistry.







Abstract
Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.

The molecular structures of the complexes [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; and [MnFe(CO)10]+ complete the series of dimetal decacarbonyls reaching from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+. In our interpretation of the Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, a chemist is hiking through the dimetal&#8208;decacarbonyl landscape, discovering the hidden heterodinuclear complexes in the fog. The fog also highlights the misty borderline situation between covalent and Lewis&#8208;pair bonding, onto which light is ornately shed. In the background, the vibrational mountain range of the title compound shows its peaks. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Krossing and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500489).

         <title>Cover Feature: Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances (Chem. Eur. J. 23/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature highlights the activation of n&#8211;&#960;* transitions in graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). A schematic diagram illustrates the n&#8211;&#960;* electronic transition pathways. By facilitating n&#8211;&#960;* transitions, the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 is successfully extended, enhancing its photocatalytic activity. More information can be found in the Review by Y.

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;Activated Luminescence for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) is a versatile platform that enables simultaneous optical imaging and tumor phototherapy, offering significant potential to bridge the gap between radiotheranostics and phototheranostics. This review presents diverse RL probes categorized by their activation mechanisms, emphasizes their applications in cancer theranostics, and provides a comprehensive insight into RL technology to accelerate its clinical translation.







Abstract
Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in&#8197;vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>

This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO2 other energy&#8208;related processes, and future research directions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n&#8208;&#960;* transitions to further advance g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n&#8208;&#960;* transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the employment of rotaxane and pseudorotaxane architecture in the controlled release of target molecules both in solution and in the solid state. The properties conferred by the mechanical bond allow precise control over the release mechanism, thus leading to new forms of molecular cargo delivery when rotaxane&#8208;based systems are employed.







Abstract
The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.
