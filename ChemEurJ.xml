         <title>Demonstrating Synergistic Activity of Magnetic Iron Oxide Nano Photocatalyst for C&#8211;H Activation in Heterogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes a dual catalytic approach for the versatile C&#8210;H arylation of arenes under photo&#8208;excitation at room temperature. The cooperative catalysis utilizes iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (which mostly contain Fe3O4 along with some &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3) as the potential photocatalyst, which merges with the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H activation cycle for the reductive generation of aryl radical from aryl diazonium salt, revealing its photocatalytic activities. The method is applicable to a wide range of aryl coupling partners and different directing groups, demonstrating excellent productivity, nice co&#8208;operativity and recyclability. Adequate control experiments and mechanistic studies assisted in establishing the radical&#8208;based mechanism for the C&#8210;H arylation occurring in the heterogeneous phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Chemical and Structural Complexity of Aluminum Hydroxy Acetates: from Commodity Chemicals to Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum acetates have been in use for more than a century, but despite their widespread commercial applications, essential scientific knowledge of their synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships is lacking. High&#8208;throughput screening, followed by fine tuning and extensive optimization of reaction conditions using Al3+, OH&#8208; and CH3COO&#8208; ions, has unraveled their complex synthetic chemistry, yielding for the first time the four phase pure products Al(OH)(O2CCH3) &#8901; x H2O (x = 0, 2) (1A and CAU&#8208;65, 1B), Al3O(HO2CCH3)(O2CCH3)7 (2), and the porous aluminum salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12](OH)4 (CAU&#8208;55&#8208;OH, 3). Structure determination by electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction was carried out and the data suggested porosity for 1B and 3, which was confirmed by physisorption experiments. Even the scale&#8208;up to the 10 L scale was accomplished for 1A, 1B and 3 with yields of up to 1.1 kg (99%). This study of a seemingly simple chemical system provides important information on both fundamental inorganic chemistry and porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ polymerized solid/quasi&#8208;solid&#160;polymer&#160;electrolyte&#160;for lithium&#8208;metal batteries: recent progress and perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pursuit of high energy density, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are undoubtedly the best choice. However, leakage and inevitable dendrite growth in liquid electrolytes seriously hinder its practical application. Solid/quasi&#8208;solid state&#160;electrolytes have emerged as an answer to solve the above issues. Especially, polymer electrolytes with excellent interface compatibility, high flexibility, and ease of machining have become a research hotspot for LMBs. Nevertheless,&#160;the interface contact between polymer electrolyte and inorganic electrode materials and the low ionic conductivity restrict its development. On account of these, in situ polymerized polymer electrolyte&#160;is proposed. Polymer solid electrolytes produced through in situ polymerization promote robust interface contact between the electrolyte and electrode while simplifying the preparation steps. This&#160;review&#160;summarized the latest research progress in in situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. These electrolytes were divided into three parts according to their polymerization methods: thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization,&#160;and so on. Furthermore, we concluded the major challenges and future trends of in situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. It&#8217;s hoped that this review will provide meaningful guidance on designing high&#8208;performance polymer solid electrolytes for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: On the Role of Local Charge Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular simulation models unravel the local charge profile of substrate&#8208;supported nanoparticles in contact to ionic liquid molecules &#8211; thus providing structural and electronic insights to nanosystems used in (electro&#8722;)catalyses. While quantum approaches are limited to comparably small systems, we demonstrate the application of the QEq method for bridging time and length scales significantly. This enables molecular simulation studies for exploring the self&#8208;organization of ionic liquid and reactant molecules on supported nanoparticle models.







Abstract
Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10&#8197;nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8722;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligands: Evaluating the Role of Acidic Protons in the Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ancillary NH groups contained within ligands can participate in reactions through metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. Substitution of the NH moiety by NMe or O can be used in the evaluation of its role. This study investigates how such substitutions also affect the electronics and the binding strengths of the ligand.







Abstract
To evaluate bifunctional ligand reactivity involving NH acidic sites in the secondary coordination sphere, complexes where the proton has been substituted with a methyl group (NMe) are often investigated. An alternative strategy involves substitution of the NH group for an O. This contribution considers and compares the merits of these approaches; the synthesis and characterization of cationic square&#8208;planar Rh carbonyl complexes bearing diprotic bispyrazole pyridine ligand L1, and the bis&#8208;methylated pyrazole pyridine ligand L1Me are described. The syntheses and characterization of the novel monoprotic pyrazole isoxazole pyridine ligand L2 and aprotic bisisoxazole pyridine ligand L3, and their corresponding Rh carbonyl complexes are also described. Comparison of the CO stretching frequencies of the four Rh complexes suggest that substitutions of NH with NMe, as well as with O, lead to significant electronic differences. These electronic differences result in different reactivities with respect to ligand addition/substitution of the Rh carbonyl complexes. Overall, the data suggest that electronic differences arising due to the NH substitutions can be significant and should be considered when the NH group is substituted in investigations of the participation of the NH proton in a reaction.

A Leishmania promastigote has immunologically important lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) on its surface and LPGs contain characteristic [&#8594;6)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Gal&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;Man&#8208;(1&#8208;PO3H] repeating units. In this study, the repeating structure was synthesized up to a triacontasaccharide derivative for the first&#8208;time using disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite derivative as a building block. The length of the product is comparable to that of a Leishmania promastigote LPGs.







Abstract
Lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) are found on the surface of Leishmania, a protozoan parasite, and are immunologically important. Herein, disaccharide 1&#8208;phosphate repeating units of LPGs were successfully synthesized on a solid support with high anomeric purity using a disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite building block. To enhance solubility in the reaction solvent, hydroxy&#8208;protecting groups in the form of para&#8208;t&#8208;butylbenzoyl were introduced to the building block. The saccharide chain was elongated via stable glycosyl boranophosphate linkages, followed by the conversion of inter&#8208;sugar linkages to phosphodiester counterparts using an oxaziridine derivative. The addition of a silylating reagent post&#8208;reaction with the oxaziridine derivative efficiently facilitated the conversion of boranophosohodiesters to phosphodiesters. This method enabled the &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of up to 15 repeating units, marking the longest homogeneous repeating units of LPGs synthesized chemically. Given the chain length equivalence to native LPGs, the method developed herein holds promise for advancing anti&#8208;Leishmanial pharmaceuticals and vaccines.

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleosidic diarylethenes was modified in three different ways by varying the connection between nucleoside and thiophene subunit with the aim of shifting the absorption wavelength of open (&#955;max,UV) and closed forms (&#955;max,Vis). A 5&#8208;uridine&#8208;2&#8208;thiophene connection (semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes) resulted in a red shift of &#955;max,UV and blue shift of &#955;max,Vis. Resulting switches showed remarkable reversibility and fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs&#8211;semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96&#8201;% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.

         <title>Tetrazole and Oxadiazole Derivatives as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties of six specially designed emitters for OLEDs, focusing on how structural variations like donor&#8208;acceptor distances and functional groups influence TADF efficiency. One standout emitter, TCz&#8208;CN, shows excellent performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter, demonstrating the potential for optimizing OLED properties through precise molecular design.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising lighting solutions for sustainability and energy efficiency. Incorporating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules enables OLEDs to achieve internal quantum efficiency (IQE), in principle, up to 100&#8201;%; therefore, new classes of promising TADF emitters and modifications of existing ones are sought after. This study explores the TADF emission properties of six designed TADF emitters, examining their photophysical responses using experimental and theoretical methods. The design strategy involves creating six distinct types of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system, where tert&#8208;butylcarbazoles are used as donors, while the acceptor component incorporates three different functional groups: nitrile, tetrazole and oxadiazole, with varying electron&#8208;withdrawing character. Additionally, the donor&#8208;acceptor distance is adjusted using a phenylene spacer, and its influence on TADF functionality is examined. The clear dependency of an additional spacer, inhibiting TADF, could be revealed. Emitters with a direct donor&#8208;acceptor connection are demonstrated to exhibit TADF moderate emissive behavior. The analysis emphasizes the impact of charge transfer, singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), and other microscopic parameters on photophysical rates, permitting TADF. Among the emitters, TCz&#8208;CN shows optimal performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter with an 88&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and fast rate of reversible intersystem crossing of 2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 1&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1, obtained from time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiment in PMMA matrix and quantum mechanical calculations, respectively. This comprehensive exploration identifies molecular bases of superior TADF emitters and provides insights for future designs, advancing the optimization of TADF properties in OLEDs.

         <dc:description>
This study investigates the ability of the carbonaceous meteorite CV3 Allende to act as a catalyst in electrochemical interactions, triggering electrocatalytic reactions resulting in nitrogen (N2) fixation and conversion to ammonia. Additionally, the evolution of crucial compounds such as H2, CN&#8722; and sulfur/H2S was observed, along with the detection of potential reagent carriers suggesting significant implications not only for Strecker synthesis and aminoacid production under space conditions but also for Panspermia theories and the study of prebiotic chemistry in early Earth.







Abstract
This study explores the electrochemical properties of the carbonaceous Allende CV3 meteorite, focusing on its potential as a Fe&#8208;based catalyst derived from Mackinawite iron sulfide for electrocatalytic reactions facilitating nitrogen (N2) fixation into ammonia. Through comprehensive analysis, we not only monitored the evolution of key compounds such as CN&#8208;, sulfur/H2S, H2 and carbonyl compounds, but also identified potential reagent carriers, indicating significant implications for the Strecker synthesis of amino acids in space environments. Initial examination revealed the presence of polypeptides, notably sequences including dimer Ala&#8208;&#945;&#8208;HO&#8208;Gly, pentamer Gly3&#8208;Ala2, and hexamer Gly4&#8208;(HO&#8208;Gly)2. These discoveries greatly enhance our understanding of astrobiological chemistry, offering valuable insights into prebiotic processes and the potential presence of life&#8208;building blocks throughout the universe.

Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) are cyclic macrocycles with rich host&#8208;guest chemistry. In many cases, guest binding in CB[n]s results in host structural deformations. Unfortunately, measuring such deformations remains a major challenge, with only a handful of manual estimations reported in the literature. To address this challenge, we have developed the public program ElliptiCB[n], which is available on GitHub, that provides a robust and automated method for measuring the elliptical deformations in CB[n] hosts. We outline the development and validation of this approach, apply ElliptiCB[n] to measure the ellipticity of the 1113 available CB[n] structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), and directly investigate the structural deformations of CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10] hosts. We also report the general landscape of accessible CB[n] elliptical deformations and compare ellipticity distributions across CB[n] hosts and host&#8208;guest complexes. We found that in almost all cases guest binding significantly impacts the distribution of host ellipticity distributions and that these distributions are dissimilar across host&#8208;guest complexes of differently sized CB[n]s. We anticipate that this work will provide a useful approach for understanding of the flexibility of CB[n] hosts and will also enable future measurement and standardization of ellipticity measurements of CB[n]s.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Active Lone Pairs Induced Second Harmonic Generation Responses and Electrocatalytic Activity in Hybrid Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid material, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8901;H2O was successfully synthesized. Both theoretical analysis and experimental data have confirmed the crucial role of the 4s lone pair electrons of the Ge atom in inducing SHG response and electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The lone pair electrons in the electronic structure of molecules have been a prominent research focus in chemistry for more than a century. Stable s2 lone pair electrons significantly influence material properties, including thermoelectric properties, nonlinear optical properties, ferroelectricity, and electro(photo)catalysis. While major advances have been achieved in understanding the influence of lone pair electrons on material characteristics, research on this effect in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials is in its initial stage. In this work, we successfully obtained a novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional material incorporating Ge with 4s2 lone pair electrons, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8208;H2O (MeHDabco=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (1). Driven by the stereochemically active lone pair electrons on the Ge2+, 1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21 at room temperature and exhibits good second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Interestingly, 1 also shows electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the existence of lone pair electrons on Ge2+ cations. The electrochemical experiment combined with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the lone pair electrons act as both an active site for proton adsorption and facilitate the ionization of water. This work not only emphasizes the important role of lone pair electrons in material properties and functions but also provides new insight for designing novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid materials.

         <title>What Determines the Lewis Acidity of a Bismuthane? Towards Bi&#8208;Based FLPs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures and reactivities of (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiX2 (X=Cl, I, C2F5) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. It turned out that the construction of functional Lewis acidic sites based on neutral bismuthanes requires substituents with a high ionic character and electronegativity, and at the same time they should not contain atoms in &#945;&#8208;position or lone pairs that are capable of undergoing effective negative hyperconjugation.







Abstract
Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8722;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital.

In this work, photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride formed a transient charge&#8208;transfer complex with NXS (X=Br, I) in acetonitrile, acting as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. This facilitated Ce(III) ion light absorption, creating halide radicals that converted N&#8208;propargylamides to oxazole aldehydes. Experiments confirmed a single electron transfer pathway. The CeCl3 was reusable with minimal decomposition.







Abstract
In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push&#8208;Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesize new push&#8211;pull compounds characterized by naphthalimide as electron acceptor and by different electron donors such as tetraphenylethylene, triphenylamine and phenothiazine. Our time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic results show that TADF is occurring in the yellow and orange&#8211;red ranges of the visible. Fluorescence quantum yields are surprisingly large, triggered by the conjugation enhancement achieved through the synthetic effort.







Abstract
In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures.

     alt="Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push-Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we synthesize new push&#8211;pull compounds characterized by naphthalimide as electron acceptor and by different electron donors such as tetraphenylethylene, triphenylamine and phenothiazine. Our time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic results show that TADF is occurring in the yellow and orange&#8211;red ranges of the visible. Fluorescence quantum yields are surprisingly large, triggered by the conjugation enhancement achieved through the synthetic effort.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures. The structure&#8211;property relationships are investigated through a joint experimental time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic and computational TD&#8211;DFT study. The femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8211;conversion experiments reveal ultrafast photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. This is likely the key factor leading to efficient spin&#8211;orbit CT&#8211;induced intersystem crossing for the TPA&#8211; and PTZ&#8211;derivatives as well as to small singlet&#8211;to&#8211;triplet energy gap. Consequently, evidence for a delayed fluorescence component is found together with the main prompt emission in the fluorescence kinetics both in solution and in thin film.

A mild and facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite leading to organic nitrate esters has been developed at room temperature in air. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds smoothly to afford the corresponding organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air the green oxidant.

         <dc:description>
Novel nanotubes of ca. 4&#8197;nm in diameter self&#8208;assembled in water from custom&#8208;tailored amphiphiles are able to selectively encapsulate apolar molecules within their lipophilic lumen.







Abstract
The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials. Here, we have further developed a bioinspired methodology for the formation of aqueous nanotubes of well&#8208;defined dimensions and pore coating through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles that are chemically programmed with complementary nucleobases. These nanotubes are endowed with a hydrophobic lumen, whose diameter can be expanded as a function of the monomer length, in which apolar dyes can be efficiently encapsulated.

A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composite material (MZT) adsorbent for V(V) adsorption. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole and enhanced natural photocatalytic degradation Rhodamine B. The study proposes a resourceful, effective method for repurposing waste via natural photocatalytic reactions leveraging clean energy, potentially contributing to environmental preservation and presenting innovative avenues for spent adsorbent recovery.







Abstract
Spent adsorbents for recycling as catalysts have drawn considerable attention due to their environmentally benign chemistry properties. However, traditional thermocatalytic strategies limit their applications. Here, we developed an enhanced photocatalytic strategy to expand the range of their applications. A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composites (MZT) for V(V) adsorption, which were prepared using chitosan, ZrO2 and Fe3O4 by one&#8208;pot synthesis. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, yielding up to 89.7&#8201;%. It also was implemented to photocatalysis reactions for recycle. The discolored rates of rhodamine B (RhB) were 72.3&#8201;% and 97.4&#8201;% by new and spent MZT, respectively. The new and spent MZT showed the forbidden bands were 251&#8197;nm and 561&#8197;nm, respectively. The result displayed spent MZT red shifted to the cyan light region. The mechanism of catalysis also has been studied in detail.

A novel series of vinylene bridged heteroaryls is presented and studied by computational methods. Calculated structural and optoelectronic properties are discussed in order to identify viable molecular designs. Notably, one candidate exhibits a narrow band gap, longer absorption wavelengths, low BLA and reorganization energy. These findings suggest its potential use as a precursor of advanced conjugated materials for organic electronics.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers are of great importance for the fabrication of organic photonic and electronic devices. To this end, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers need to meet both optoelectronic and key structural properties in order to fulfill their implementation as active components. In particular, they need to possess low bandgap and high thermal, conformational, and photochemical stabilities. So far, several strategies have been developed to attain such requirements including the covalent and non&#8208;covalent rigidification concepts of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. On the basis of these findings, we describe herein the theoretical studies of novel series of covalently bridged derivatives demonstrating the benefits of the strategy. Comparison of these derivatives with compounds previously described in the literature highlights enhanced optoelectronic properties and behaviors that would be beneficial for the construction and development of new linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers.

         <title>Synthesis and Analysis of (&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) Aryl Ethers as a Polar Fluoroaliphatic Motif</title>

(&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers are prepared as a new motif from tosylate 3. The motif has a preferred &#8216;propellar&#8217; conformation which can adopt left or right handed twists. LogP's are lower than tert&#8208;butyl analogues. Interactions between TFNP groups in the solid state are shown to also anchor supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
A route is developed to (&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8722;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their neopentyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

         <title>Merging of a Supramolecular Ligand with a Switchable Luminophore &#8211; Light&#8208;Responsiveness, Photophysics and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission is reported. The design concept is based on merging of cyanostilbenes with guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrroles yielding hybrid luminophores, capable to undergo photoisomerization and are able to be used in biomedical imaging.







Abstract
In this contribution we report on a novel approach towards luminescent light&#8208;responsive ligands. To this end, cyanostilbene&#8208; guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole hybrids were designed and investigated. Merging of a luminophore with a supramolecular bioactive ligand bears numerous advantages by overcoming the typical drawbacks of drug&#8208;labelling, influencing the overall performance of the active species by attachment of a large luminophore. Here we were able to establish a simple and easily accessible synthesis route to different cyanostyryl&#8208;guanidininiocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (CGCP) derivatives. These compounds were investigated regarding their light&#8208;responsive double bond isomerisation, their molecular structures in single crystals by means of X&#8208;ray diffractometry, their emission properties by state of the art photophysical characterisation as well as bioimaging and assessment of cell toxicity.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Crystalline Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Surfactant Complex with Chiral Supramolecular Structure and Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal with a helical structure and tunable CPL was fabricated by a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation. This material exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and a helical structure without inherent chirality. Chiral solvation imparts TPE&#8208;DHAB with a preferred handedness, enabling tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) when using a chiral solvent.







Abstract
A novel room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal of tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8208;DHAB) was synthesized using an ionic self&#8208;assembly strategy. The TPE&#8208;DHAB complex exhibits typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties and a unique helical supramolecular structure. Moreover, the generation and handedness inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) can be achieved through further chiral solvation, providing a facile approach to fabricate room&#8208;temperature liquid crystalline materials with controllable supramolecular structures and tunable CPL properties through a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation process.

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium incorporation onto already electron&#8208;deficient benzene diimides is demonstrated here. In the solid state, these compounds engage in interesting anion&#8211;&#960; interactions and H&#8722;bonding patterns. Injection of electrons is facile (ca. &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) and results in species with NIR absorption maxima (&#955;max up to 821&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8211;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8211;water H&#8722;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.

A new sustainable method for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;N,S&#8208;heterocycles, including 1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;imines and 4,5&#8208;dihydrothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines is reported. This innovative approach offers considerable shorter reaction times with higher yields, reduced energy consumption, and the elimination of hazardous chemicals. Moreover, the process is scalable, as demonstrated by the reaction conducted on a 10&#8197;mmol scale. This method represents a significant advancement in producing pharmacologically relevant compounds.







Abstract
This study introduces a sustainable and pioneering cascade synthesis of 1,3&#8208;thiazolidine derivatives under eco&#8208;friendly conditions. The methodology transcends traditional approaches yielding complex novel compounds with unique N,S&#8208;heterocyclic structures. By operating at room temperature, utilizing green solvents, and minimizing excess of reactants, this procedure offers an innovative pathway for sustainable chemical development. Notably, this method not only prioritizes sustainability but also delivers high&#8208;purity products with exceptional yields. The simplicity of the process, requiring only a simple filtration and featuring short reaction times, underscores its efficiency and utility.

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple model to explain the preferred geometry for tricoordinate pnictogen pincer complexes is proposed based on competing &#960; and &#963; effects to make sense of the variable structures reported in the literature. This model is supported by density functional theory calculations of more than 1300 structures, determining the energy of 64 compounds spanning geometries from planar to pyramidal.







Abstract
Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Oxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides and oxamates yields N&#8208;aryloxamates in moderate to excellent yields, especially when oxamates bear bulky tertiary alkyl groups. These oxamates are hydrolyzed to oxamic acids, then converted into urethanes using PIDA or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and oxamates is shown to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryloxamates with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, when the oxamate precursor incorporates a bulky tertiary alkyl group effectively preventing product degradation under the strongly basic reaction conditions. The final oxamic acids are then generated through the acid hydrolysis of the oxamate in high yields. These acids were then converted into urethanes using PIDA under thermal conditions or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process. While electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;aryl oxamic acids provide urethanes with high efficiencies, electron&#8208;rich counterparts led to diminished yields due to aryl group over&#8208;oxidation induced by PIDA.

The glycosyl phosphate repeating units found in the lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) of Leishmania and the capsular polysaccharides of some bacteria play immunologically important roles. In this Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401226), K. Kawato, K. Sato, and T. Wada report the &#945;&#8208;selective solid&#8208;phase synthesis of glycosyl phosphate structures of up to 15 repeating units with glycosyl boranophosphates as stable intermediates. The cover art shows the structure of synthesized disaccharide 1&#8208;phosphate repeating units that is found in LPGs of Leishmania donovani.

This study dives into the electrochemical secrets of the Allende CV3 meteorite, checking out its potential as a Fe&#8208;based catalyst from Mackinawite iron sulfide to turn nitrogen into ammonia. Along the way, we found compounds like CN&#8722;, sulfur/H2S, H2, and carbonyls, and even discovered polypeptides like Gly3. These findings suggest that space rocks might be busy cooking up amino acids, giving us a cosmic clue about how life's building blocks might be scattered across the universe.

Metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk phases of ionic liquids are within reach of molecular dynamics simulations. In their Concept (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402036), S. Trzeciak and D. Zahn discuss the charge equilibration (QEq) method for dynamically adjusting atom&#8208;centred partial charges to model changes in local environments. Insights encompass the effect of molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltages&#8212;thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8208;)catalysis from molecular modelling.

Artificial metallonucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic agent. This review introduces concepts core to this area such as DNA structure, AMN design, and cleavage mechanisms. We also describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities.







Abstract
Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as DNA molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic with high clinical potential. This review provides a primary level of exploration on the concepts key to this area including an introduction to DNA structure, function, recognition, along with damage and repair mechanisms. Building on this foundation, we describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide molecular scissors with enhanced or sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities. As this research field continues to evolve, understanding the applications of AMNs along with synthetic conjugation strategies can provide the basis for future innovations, particularly for designing new artificial gene editing systems.

Electrochemistry and photochemistry join forces in the booming field of electrophotocatalysis. Electrophotocatalytic activation is suitable to engage even previously inaccessible compounds in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herin we provide an overview of recent developments in this field.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) has evolved as a new scientific discipline around the boundary of highly active fields: electrochemistry and photocatalysis. EPC allows us to combine the energy of light and electric potential to activate previously inaccessible compounds via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Herein, we review the most essential applications of EPC to the C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules. This work discusses mechanisms that can be encountered when designing such processes and analyzes technical aspects of performing EPC reactions in the laboratory.

Since the synthesis of heptacene in 2006, the race to obtain and study the properties of largest acenes resulted in the development of innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to on&#8208;surface chemistry. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of large acenes, up to tridecacene, highlighting the newest studies.







Abstract
Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of large acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.

         <title>Mechanochemical Diversity in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural parameters are known to govern covalent polymer mechanochemistry, but the complexity increases when chemically different chains are linked by covalent bonds, as in block copolymers (BCPs). This review highlights studies trying to define structure&#8208;activity relationship in the mechanochemistry of BCPs in various states, with an emphasis on the influence of their morphologies.







Abstract
Covalent polymer chains are known to undergo mechanochemical events when subjected to mechanical forces. Such force&#8208;coupled reactions, like C&#8722;C bond scission in homopolymers, typically occur in a non&#8208;selective manner but with a higher probability at the mid&#8208;chain. In contrast, block copolymers (BCPs), composed of two or more chemically distinct chains linked by covalent bonds, have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different mechanochemical reactivities and selectivities. These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self&#8208;assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force&#8208;sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.

These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self-assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non-covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force-sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trance Amount of Ir Decorated NiFe Phosphide In&#8208;Situ Grown on Carbon Cloth as Cost&#8208;Effective Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is a key constituent to establish the balance of cost and catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water electrolysis in the area of energy conversion and storage. NiFe phosphide decorated with trace amount of iridium (Ir) species in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth was prepared by a facile wet chemistry approach followed by a phosphorization post&#8208;treatment at a relative low temperature. The optimal electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, exhibits excellent OER activity, with an low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for alkaline OER, and a desirable long&#8208;term durability over 90 h. The outstanding OER performance stems from the structural evolution via phosphorization process, Ir decoration with more high&#8208;valence stated Ir4+ species, and tight connection between individual components of the electrode, which gives rise to the strong activity to the active sites and faster reaction kinetics in the alkaline OER process. Mover, the Ir loading was as low as approximately ~1.7 wt% (0.29 mg cm&#8208;2), showing promissing propective in cost&#8208;effective OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition and optimisation of amorphous NixSy catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyser has shown its potential in green hydrogen production. One of the crucial tasks is discover novel cost&#8208;effective and sustainable electrocatalyst materials. In this study, a low&#8208;cost Ni&#8208;S&#8208;based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction was prepared via a simple electrodeposition process from a modified Watts bath recipe. Physical characterisation methods suggest this deposit film to be amorphous. Optimisation of the electrodeposition parameters of the NixSy catalyst was carried out using a rotating disk electrode setup. The optimised catalyst exhibited excellent catalytical performance in 1 M KOH on a microelectrode, with overpotentials of 41 mV, 111 mV and 202 mV at 10, 100 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 with Tafel slope of 67.9 mV dec&#8208;1 recorded at 333 K. Long&#8208;term testing of the catalyst demonstrated steady performance over a 24 h period on microelectrode at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 with only 71 mV and 37 mV overpotential increase at 293 K and 333 K respectively. Full cell testing with the optimised NixSy as cathode and NiFe(OH&#173;)2 as anode showed 1.88 V after 1 h electrolysis at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 in 1 M KOH under 333 K with FAA&#8208;3&#8208;30 membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromatic Natural Terpenes as Unusual &#8220;Slingshot&#8221; Antioxidants with Promising Ferroptosis Inhibition Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism based on extensive cellular membrane peroxidation, implicated in neurodegenerative and other diseases. The essential oil component &#947;&#8208;terpinene, a natural monoterpene with a unique highly oxidizable pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene skeleton, inhibits peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipid in model heterogeneous systems (micelles and liposomes). Upon H&#8208;atom abstraction, an unstable &#947;&#8208;terpinene&#8208;derived peroxyl radical is formed, that aromatizes to p&#8208;cymene generating HOO&#8226; radicals. As HOO&#8226; are small and hydrophilic radicals, they quickly diffuse outside the lipid core, blocking the radical chain propagation of polyunsaturated lipids. This unprecedented antioxidant &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism explains why &#947;&#8208;terpinene shows a protective activity against ferroptosis, being effective at submicromolar concentrations in human neuroblastoma (SH&#8208;SY5Y) cells</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Cleavage of Double&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) to Single&#8208;Stranded DELs with Compounds at the 3' End: Its Application in Photo&#8208;crosslinking Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology is a crucial tool in pharmaceutical research, rapidly identifying compounds that bind to a target of interest from an extensive pool of compounds. In this study, we propose a new method for generating single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end. The introduction of uniquely designed hairpin&#8208;shaped headpieces containing deoxyuridine (NC&#8208;HP) and the use of a cleavage enzyme facilitate the conversion from double&#8208;stranded DELs (dsDELs) to such ssDELs. Moreover, Klenow fill&#8208;in provides the dsDELs with photo&#8208;crosslinkers covalently linked to the coding region, which exhibit durability even under stringent washing conditions and enable photo&#8208;crosslinking with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, as also confirmed in cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking selections.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Isomeric Co&#8208;CPs for Luminescence Recognition and Catalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two Co&#8208;based supramolecular isomers were synthesized from a fluorinated carboxylic acid ligand under hydrothermal conditions at varying temperatures. Both exhibited similar one&#8208;dimensional chain structures while different bending connections of the aromatic rings led to different supramolecular structures, namely CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2, respectively. The structural differences of two isomers resulted in discrepant performance with regards to luminescence sensing and catalysis. CoCP&#8208;1 demonstrated more significant luminescence quenching activity toward biomarkers 2,6&#8208;dipyridinoic acid (DPA) and high vanilloid acid (HVA), which could be distinguished in the presence of Eu3+. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 3.4 and 1.3 &#956;M, respectively. The recovery rate of for HVA and DPA was within the range of 89.6&#8208;101.2% and 99.7&#8208;117.9% in simulated urine and serum, respectively, indicating potential reliability in monitoring these two analytes in real samples. Notably, CoCP&#8208;2 exhibited catalytic activity for the oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Our finding here suggests that the coordination conformation of the ligands within supramolecular isomers plays a pivotal role in determining the structure and luminescence sensing/catalysis performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Design and Self&#8208;assembly of pH&#8208;Responsive Multidomain Peptides Incorporating Non&#8208;natural&#160;Ionic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides, particularly pH&#8208;responsive variants, hold significant promise in biomedical and technological applications by leveraging the broad pH spectrum inherent to biological environments. However, the limited number of natural pH&#8208;responsive amino acids within biologically relevant pH ranges presents challenges for designing rational pH&#8208;responsive peptide assemblies. In our study, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating a library of non&#8208;natural amino acids featuring chemically diverse tertiary amine side chains. Hydrophobic and ionic properties of these non&#8208;natural amino acids facilitate their incorporation into the assembly domain when uncharged, and electrostatic repulsion promotes disassembly under lower pH conditions. Furthermore, we observed a direct relationship between the number of substitutions and the hydrophobicity of these amino acids, influencing their pH&#8208;responsive properties and enabling rational design based on desired transitional pH ranges. The structure&#8208;activity relationship of these pH&#8208;responsive peptides was evaluated by assessing their antimicrobial properties, as their antimicrobial activity is triggered by the disassembly of peptides to release active monomers. This approach not only enhances the specificity and controllability of pH responsiveness but also broadens the scope of peptide materials in biomedical and technological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Aromatic Substitution: A Study on Guanidino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic substitution of redox&#8208;active aromatic compounds could be initiated by a preceding redox step. We report on the different reaction pathways of such redox&#8208;induced substitution (RIAS) reactions between a redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecule (GFA) and an amine or guanidine. Oxidation of the GFA leads to an umpolung of the guanidine from a nucleophile to an electrophile and thereby enables addition of the amine or guanidine. Several examples are given, demonstrating the use of redox substitution in synthetic chemistry, e.g. for the convenient synthesis of novel N&#8208;heteropolycyclic molecules and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Fortuitous Enantiomeric Self&#8208;Rectification of an Unreported Partial Racemisation in the Synthesis of a Chiral Phosphoric Acid: A Warning to Practitioners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Racemisation without Consequence: MOM deprotection of an ether intermediate during a routine synthesis of phosphoric acid 1 promoted partial racemisation of the product BINOL 5. Surprisingly, however, after phosphorylation of the partially racemised BINOL, enantiopure acid 1 was isolated. Further inspection revealed that during phosphorylation, unhydrolysed racemic phosphorochloridate 6 precipitated, thus restoring homochirality in the product phosphoric acid 1. Moreover, MOM deprotection partial racemisation was avoided by conducting reactions at lower temperatures for no longer than the required deprotection time, and/or by application of other deprotection conditions from the literature.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determination of partial orders of reactions in kinetics is a general entry step for any mechanistic investigation; recently, considerable attention has been given to the benefits of using visual methods to help in this task, such as easy utilization and data&#8208;efficiency. In this respect, we here revisit and improve the classic method by Powell and Margerison for kinetic analysis. For the first time, analytical equations for a bimolecular reaction have been worked out for all values of partial orders of reactions, and the solutions have been implemented in a free, open&#8208;access and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use Web&#8208;application, named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, which also allows estimation of the errors on the kinetic constant, and residual standard error on concentrations. Several examples, taken from reference teaching experiences and from recent literature in catalysis show the efficacy and accuracy of our approach, which also has the advantage of requiring less experimental runs than other visual methods currently available.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformations of solid samples under solvent&#8208;free or minimal solvent conditions set the future trend and define a modern strategy for the production of new materials. Of the various technologies tested in recent years, the mechanochemical approach seems to be the most promising.&#160;The aim of this review article is to present the current state of art in solid state research on binary systems, which have found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical and materials science industries. This article is divided into three sections. In the first part, we describe the new equipment improvements.&#160;A brief description of techniques dedicated to ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ studies of progress and the mechanism of solid matter transformation&#160; is presented. In the second section, we discuss the problem of cocrystal polymorphism highlighting the issue related with correlation between mechanochemical parameters (time, temperature, energy, molar ratio,&#160;liquid assistant, surface energy, crystal size, crystal shape) and preference for the formation of requested polymorph. The last part is devoted to the description of the processes of coformer exchange in binary systems forced by mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. The influence of the thermodynamic factor on the selection of the best&#8208;suited partner for the formation of a two&#8208;component&#160; structure is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Titanate Perovskites in the Oxidation of Amines to Imines via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering that structural differences could affect the photocatalytic efficiency of titanate perovskites, cubic SrTiO3 (STO) and tetragonal CaTiO3 (CTO) were synthesised as models to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. STO and CTO materials were produced through hydrothermal approaches, adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure to optimise material purity. Among the perovskite photocatalysts, two stand out for their exceptional photocatalytic capacity and crystalline purity: CaTiO3, prepared at 180 &#186;C for 36 h, and SrTiO3, synthesised at 200 &#186;C for 24 h. Notably, we explore the selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine (BZA) to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BZI), with CaTiO3 emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction. The CTO material prepared at 180 &#186;C for 36 h (CTO180T&#8208;36) achieved a peak BZI production of 0.5 mM, with a total conversion of BZA after 7 h of irradiation. This study also emphasises the crucial role of reaction conditions and perovskite morphologies in fine&#8208;tuning photocatalytic performance. These findings highlight opportunities for developing efficient and selective photocatalytic processes, holding the compromise for applications in organic synthesis and sustainable green chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering interfacial molecular interactions on Ag Hollow fibre gas diffusion electrodes for high efficiency in CO2 conversion to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) occurs at the nanoscale interface of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte. Therefore, tailoring the interfacial properties in the interface microenvironment provides a powerful strategy to optimise the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards the desired products. Here, the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface of the flow&#8208;through Ag&#8208;based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO2 mass transfer and the formation of the triple&#8208;phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long&#8208;alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB&#8208;containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95 % in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO2/H2O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR.</dc:description>

Here, the microenvironment at the electrode-electrolyte interface of the flow-through Ag-based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO2 mass transfer and the formation of the triple-phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long-alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB-containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95 % in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO2/H2O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclization by Intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring systems of all sizes are frequent core or substructures in natural products and they are important elements of many drug molecules, as they often confer high binding affinity to and selectivity for disease&#8208;relevant biological targets. A uniform key transformation in the synthesis of such structures is the cyclization step. Among the various approaches that have been developed for ring closure, the intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has emerged as a powerful option for the construction of normal&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized rings as well as macrocycles, due to its stereospecificity, the mild reaction conditions, and the non&#8208;toxic nature of the boron by&#8208;products. In this review, we summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of the application of intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in the construction of (macro)cyclic frameworks of natural products and bioactive molecules of synthetic origin, covering (mostly) examples that have been reported since 2015. Target molecules prepared via intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling as a key step range from natural products / natural product analogs to synthetic drug candidates, featuring ring sizes from 4 to &gt;&gt;12. We highlight the utility, scope, and limitations of the reaction for different ring sizes and arrays of functional groups. Where possible, comparisons with other methods of cyclization are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Toughening Healable Supramolecular Double Polymer Networks Based on Hydrogen Bonding and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double polymer networks (DNs) consist of two interpenetrating polymer networks and can offer properties that are not merely a sum of the parts. Here, we report an elastic DN made from two supramolecular polymers (SMPs) that consist of the same poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (BA) backbone. The two polymers feature different non&#8208;covalent binding motifs, which form dynamic, reversible cross&#8208;links. The polymers were prepared by reversible addi&#173;ti&#173;on&#8722;frag&#173;mentation chain&#8208;transfer polymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate and either the self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyri&#173;mi&#173;dinone, or the 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#173;benz&#173;&#173;imidazolyl)&#173;pyridine ligand, which forms complexes with metal ions. The supramolecular DN made by these components combines features of the single networks, including high thermal stability and resistance to creep. The DN further exhibits excellent healability and displays a higher extensibility and a higher toughness than its constituents. The mechanical characteristics of the DN can be further enhanced by selectively pre&#8208;stretching one of the networks, which is readily possible due to the reversible formation of the supramolecular cross&#8208;links and their orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsive&#173;ness.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented cubic mesomorphic behaviour of crown&#8208;ether functionalized amphiphilic cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic supramolecular materials based on biodegradable cyclodextrins (CDs) have been known to self&#8208;assemble into different types of thermotropic liquid crystals, including smectic and hexagonal columnar mesophases. Previous studies on amphiphilic CDs bearing 14 aliphatic chains at the primary face and 7 oligoethylene glycol (OEG) chains at the secondary face showed that the stability of the mesophase can be rationally tuned through implemation of terminal functional groups to the OEG chains. Here, we report the syntheses of first examples of crown ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic cyclodextrins that unexpectedly form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic phases. This constitutes the first reported examples of cyclodextrins forming such phases, which are potentially capable of 3D ion transport. Lithium composites were made to assess lithium conduction in the material. XRD revealed the added lithium salt destabilizes the cubic phase in favour of the smectic phase. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies showed that these materials conduct lithium ions with a very low activation energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Aromatic C&#8722;O Linkages by Oxoammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8211;O bond is important to the conversion of biomass and plastic wastes into value&#8208;added chemicals. Here we put forward the oxidative cleavage of para&#8208;C&#8211;O bonds in phenolic compounds in use of oxoammonium salts as oxidant and water as the oxygen source. The mechanism is that oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct and thus realizes the ipso&#8208;substitution of 4&#8208;alkoxyphenol, which is proved by substituent effect, isotope labelling experiments, and kinetic analysis. Furthermore, this protocol is successfully applied into the depolymerization of both lignin model compounds with &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;5 and 4&#8208;O&#8208;5 linkages and polyphenylene oxide (PPO).</dc:description>

Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed template&#8208;assisted m&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization reaction of arylmethane sulfonates has been reported. The methodology has been found to be compatible with naphthoquinones and various maleimides and thus further generated the desired product in good yields with a very high meta&#8208;selectivity.

Abstract
An efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted aryl naphthoquinones via a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed template&#8208;assisted m&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization reaction of arylmethane sulfonates have been demonstrated. The method involves usage of less expensive and abundant pharmacologically important scaffold naphthoquinone. A wide range of arylmethane sulfonates were examined and found to be compatible with the protocol. The protocol has also been further extended to the synthesis of various substituted aryl maleimide scaffolds. A plausible reaction mechanism has also been proposed to account for the selective distal m&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization reaction.

A plausible reaction mechanism has also been proposed to account for the selective distal &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond functionalization reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Phi29&#8208;DNAP Variants for Customized DNA Hydrogel Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA hydrogels, which hold potential for use in medicine, biosensors, and tissue engineering, can be produced through enzymatic rolling circle amplification (RCA) using phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP). This paper introduces new DNAP variants designed for RCA&#8208;based DNA hydrogel production, featuring enzymes with modified DNA binding, enhanced thermostability, reduced exonuclease activity, and protein tags for fluorescence detection or specific immobilization. We evaluated these enzymes by quantifying DNA output via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and assessing hydrogel mechanical properties through micromechanical indentation. The results showed that most variants generated similar DNA amounts and hydrogels with comparable mechanical properties. Additionally, all variants successfully incorporated non&#8208;natural nucleotides, such as base&#8208;modified dGTP derivatives and 2'&#8208;fluoro&#8208;dGTP, during RCA. This study's robust analytical approach offers a strong foundation for selecting new enzymes and producing DNA hydrogels with tailored material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic [4+2] Annulation for S&#8208;Heterocycle Assembly Enabled by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of isothiochromenes by PCET&#8208;accelerated photoelectrocatalytic intermolecular dehydrogenative [4+2] C&#8722;S/C&#8722;C annulation was developed. The resource&#8208;economic photoelectrosynthesis obviated transition&#8208;metal catalysts, oxidation reagents, and high reaction temperatures.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) present an efficient strategy for the assembly of biorelevant heterocycles, but are thus far largely limited to toxic transition metals and rather harsh reaction conditions. In sharp contrast, we, herein report on a mild photoelectrocatalyzed CDC&#8208;[4+2] annulation enabling the synthesis of functionalized isothiochromenes enabled by a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) strategy. The transformative photoelectrocatalysis obviated toxic transition&#8208;metal, high reaction temperatures, and stoichiometric chemical redox reagents. This approach was characterized by exceedingly mild conditions, ample substrate scope, and a commercially available catalyst. Gram&#8208;scale reactions and a telescoped synthesis route reflected the unique potential in the green synthesis of important S&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Tutorial Review on the Set&#8208;Up and Running of Quantum Mechanical Cluster Models for Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Tutorial Review gives an overview on the set&#8208;up of QM cluster models that can be used for calculations on the mechanism of enzymatic reaction processes. Furthermore, recent examples are given that highlight the accuracy and reproducibility of the models and recommendations are given on best practice.







Abstract
Enzymes turnover substrates into products with amazing efficiency and selectivity and as such have great potential for use in biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. However, details of their catalytic cycles and the origins surrounding the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity of enzymatic reaction processes remain unknown, which makes the engineering of enzymes and their use in biotechnology challenging. Computational modelling can assist experimental work in the field and establish the factors that influence the reaction rates and the product distributions. A popular approach in modelling is the use of quantum mechanical cluster models of enzymes that take the first&#8208; and second coordination sphere of the enzyme active site into consideration. These QM cluster models are widely applied but often the results obtained are dependent on model choice and model selection. Herein, we show that QM cluster models can give highly accurate results that reproduce experimental product distributions and free energies of activation within several kcal mol&#8722;1, regarded that large cluster models with &gt;300 atoms are used that include key hydrogen bonding interactions and charged residues. In this tutorial review, we give general guidelines on the set&#8208;up and applications of the QM cluster method and discuss its accuracy and reproducibility. Finally, several representative QM cluster model examples on metal&#8208;containing enzymes are presented, which highlight the strength of the approach.

         <title>Unraveling the Source of Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism in Chiral Dipeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy and computational analysis shed light on the SIDA (Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism) phenomenon occurring in non&#8208;racemic mixtures of chiral dipeptide derivatives. Self&#8208;assembly in solution gives rise to diastereomeric homochiral and heterochiral adducts tightly associated, which can be differentiated by proton NMR analysis based on their different chemical shift, due to a different stereochemical arrangement.







Abstract
Mastering of analytical methods for accurate quantitative determinations of enantiomeric excess is a crucial aspect in asymmetric catalysis, chiral synthesis, and pharmaceutical applications. In this context, the phenomenon of Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism (SIDA) can be exploited in NMR spectroscopy for accurate determinations of enantiomeric composition, without using a chiral auxiliary that could interfere with the spectroscopic investigation. This phenomenon can be particularly useful for improving the quantitative analysis of mixtures with low enantiomeric excesses, where direct integration of signals can be tricky. Here, we describe a novel analysis protocol to correctly determine the enantiomeric composition of scalemic mixtures and investigate the thermodynamic and stereochemical features at the basis of SIDA. Dipeptide derivatives were chosen as substrates for this study, given their central role in drug design. By integrating the experiments with a conformational stochastic search that includes entropic contributions, we provide valuable information on the dimerization thermodynamics, the nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions leading to self&#8208;association, and the differences in the chemical environment responsible for the anisochronism, highlighting the importance of different stereochemical arrangement and tight association for the distinction between homochiral and heterochiral adducts. An important role played by the counterion was pointed out by computational studies.

         <title>Synthesis of Amorphous Nickel&#8208;Cobalt Hydroxides for Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrothermal route for synthesizing amorphous Ni&#8722;Co hydroxide (NC(OH)) and in the subsequent step crystalline NiCo2O4 (NCO) using water as the solvent is reported for nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. The presence of Ni and Co in hydroxide form reduced crystalline having rod&#8208;like morphology and shows improved electrochemical activity of 268&#8197;mAh/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g over the NCO electrode.







Abstract
In this work we developed a hydrothermal method for synthesizing amorphous Ni&#8722;Co hydroxide (NC(OH)) and in the subsequent step crystalline NiCo2O4 (NCO) has been produced using water as the solvent. For nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, NC(OH) was found to have superior performance to its NCO prepared by two&#8208;step process. The thermal stability analysis exhibited the optimum temperature to obtain the NC(OH), and NCO electrode materials. The XRD pattern showed mixed phases containing both Ni and Co hydroxides (during the initial step) and in the subsequent step (calcined) the formation of cubic spinel structure was noticed. For NC(OH), aggregated particles with irregular morphology were observed while clustered nanorod&#8208;like shapes were noticed for NCO samples. To be noted, that the nanorod morphology was obtained through a facile approach without employing any structure&#8208;directing agent. Both NC(OH) and NCO were employed as cathodes for Ni&#8722;Zn battery studies against Zn foil anode with a polyamide&#8208;based separator soaked in 6&#8197;M KOH saturated with ZnO additive was used as electrolyte. The Ni&#8722;Zn cell was fabricated in CR2032 coin cell configuration. The electrochemical studies such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed the characteristic redox peaks for NC(OH) sample exhibiting high peak current compared to its NCO counterpart. The NC(OH) had a capacity of 268&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 against 120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 for NCO at a current density of 1&#8197;Ag&#8722;1. The cell was able to retain 85&#8201;% of the capacity at the end of 500 cycles and showed remarkable rate capability. The Ni&#8722;Zn battery presents energy and power densities of 428.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&#8722;1 and 2.68&#8197;kW&#8201;Kg&#8722;1, respectively surpassing the normal values reported for aqueous rechargeable batteries. Owing to the presence of Ni and Co in hydroxide form (reduced crystallinity) the NC(OH) sample showed improved electrochemical activity. This work provides a facile approach and effective strategy for developing bimetallic hydroxides for optimal energy storage performance.

The cell was able to retain 85&#8201;% of the capacity at the end of 500 cycles and showed remarkable rate capability. The Ni&#8722;Zn battery presents energy and power densities of 428.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2.68&#8197;kW&#8201;Kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively surpassing the normal values reported for aqueous rechargeable batteries. Owing to the presence of Ni and Co in hydroxide form (reduced crystallinity) the NC(OH) sample showed improved electrochemical activity. This work provides a facile approach and effective strategy for developing bimetallic hydroxides for optimal energy storage performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organoboron Polymorphs with Different Molecular Packing Modes for Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organoboron compound and its polymorphic crystals with different packing modes are developed. Narrowband photoluminescence spectra with the FWHM of less than 30&#8197;nm are obtained in solution, thin film and microcrystals, while TADF and optical waveguide properties are also demonstrated in microcrystals.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds offer a new strategy to design optoelectronic materials with high fluorescence efficiency. In this paper, the organoboron compound B&#8208;BNBP with double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine bearing four fluorine atoms as core unit is facilely synthesized and exhibits a narrowband emission spectrum and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 86.53&#8201;% in solution. Its polymorphic crystals were controllable prepared by different solution self&#8208;assembly methods. Two microcrystals possess different molecular packing modes, one&#8208;dimensional microstrips (1D&#8208;MSs) for H&#8208;aggregation and two&#8208;dimensional microdisks (2D&#8208;MDs) for J&#8208;aggregation, owing to abundant intermolecular interactions of four fluorine atoms sticking out conjugated plane. Their structure&#8208;property relationships were investigated by crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculation. Strong emission spectra with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 30&#8197;nm can also be observed in thin film and 2D&#8208;MDs. 1D&#8208;MSs possess thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) property and exhibit superior optical waveguide performance with an optical loss of 0.061&#8197;dB/&#956;m. This work enriches the diversity of polymorphic microcrystals and further reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship in organoboron micro/nano&#8208;crystals.

         <title>N&#8208;doped Porous Carbon Derived from the Pyrolysis of a Polydopamine&#8208;coated Hypercross&#8208;linked Polymer for Enhanced CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous carbon materials can simultaneously capture and convert carbon dioxide, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and using carbon dioxide as a feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals or fuel. In this work, a series of N&#8208;doped porous carbons (PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T) was prepared; the CO2 adsorption capacity of the prepared PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T was enhanced by coating polydopamine (PDA) on a hypercross&#8208;linked polymer (HCP) and then adjusting the mass ratio of PDA to HCP and the carbonization temperature. The results showed that the prepared PDA@HCP(1:1)&#8208;850 exhibited a high CO2 adsorption capacity due to abundant micropores (0.6762 cm3/g), a high specific surface area (1220.8 m&#178;/g), and moderate surface nitrogen content (2.75%). Notably, PDA@HCP(1:1)&#8208;850 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 6.46 mmol/g at 0 &#176;C and 101 kPa. Critically, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons can also be used as catalysts for the reaction of CO2 with epichlorohydrin to form chloropropylene carbonate, with chloropropylene carbonate yielding up to 64% and selectivity of the reaction reaching 94%. As a result, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons could serve as potential candidates for CO2 capture and conversion due to their high reactivity, excellent CO2 uptake, and good catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here in, we have designed two new unfused non&#8208;fullerene small molecules based on asymmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3.4&#8208;b', 6,5&#8208;b"]trithiophene (BTT) central donor core and different terminal units, i.e. 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (NFA&#8208;4) and 1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioxodi hydropyrimidine&#8208;4,6(1H,5H)&#8208;dione (NFA&#8208;5) and their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. Employing a wide band&#8208;gap copolymer D18, the binary D18: NFA&#8208;4 and D18:NFA&#8208;5 bulk heterojunction&#8208;based organic solar cells realized an overall power conversion efficiency of about 17.07% and 11.27 %, respectively. The higher value of power conversion efficiency for the NFA&#8208;4&#8208;based organic solar cells, as compared to the NFA&#8208;5 counterpart, is attributed to the enhanced values of short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor. After the incorporation of NFA&#8208;5 into the binary bulk heterojunction D18:NFA&#8208;4, the ternary organic solar cells attained a power conversion efficiency of 18.05 %, which is higher than that for the binary counterparts and attributed to the increased values of short circuit current, fill factor, and open circuit voltage. The increased value of short circuit current is associated with the effective utilization of excitons through the energy transfer from the NFA&#8208;5 to NFA&#8208;4 as the NFA&#8208;4 exhibits a more significant dipole moment than the NFA&#8208;5 and is effectively dissociated into a free charge carrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Dysprosium Compounds: The Importance of Rigid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis, structures and magnetic behaviour of two isostructural dinuclear Dy3+ complexes where the metal ions of a previously reported monomeric building block are connected by a peroxide (O22&#8208;) or a pair of fluoride (2 x F&#8208;) bridges. The nature of the bridge determines the distance between the metal ion dipoles leading to a dipolar coupling in the peroxido bridged compound of only ca. 70% of that in the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged dimer. The sign of the overall coupling between the metals is antiferromagnetic for the peroxido bridged compound and ferromagnetic for the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged complex. This in turn influences the magnetisation dynamics. We compare the relaxation characteristics of the dimers with those of the previously reported monomeric building block. The relaxation dynamics for the bis&#8208;fluorido system are very fast. On the other hand, comparing the properties of the monomer, the peroxido bridged sample and the corresponding Y&#8208;doped sample show that the relaxation properties via a Raman process have very similar parameters. We show that a second dysprosium is important for either tuning or detuning the Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) properties of a system.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Modulating of W 18 O 49 &#160;Nanospheres by Niobium Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient electrocatalysts to reduce HER overpotential is vital to enhance hydrogen production efficiency and minimize energy consumption. Adjusting the electronic structure of transition metal oxides via elemental doping is a potent strategy to improve the effectiveness of electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. In this work, we synthesized a set of niobium&#8208;doped tungsten oxides (Nbx&#8208;W18O49) under anoxic conditions using a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal approach. After doping Nb, the oxygen vacancy content inside W18O49&#160;was increased, which induced a synergistic effect with the active sites of tungsten. In acidic environments, the hydrogen evolution activity of the Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49&#160;electrocatalyst is second&#160;only by 20 wt% Pt/C. It attains a current density of &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;at an overpotential of 102 mV. By comparison with W18O49, Nb0.4&#8208;W18O49&#160;and Nb0.5&#8208;W18O49, Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49&#160;demonstrates a reduced charge transfer resistance, which significantly enhances its conductivity and the speed of electron movement across interfaces. Coupled with this feature are notably faster HER kinetics. Additionally, it exhibits excellent stability, meaning it maintains its performance and structural integrity over prolonged periods and under various operational conditions. This article provides a new perspective for discovering inexpensive and efficient hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation, structure, reactivity, Lewis acidic and fluorescence properties of arylpyridine based boron C,N&#8208;chelates featuring weakly coordinating anions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the preparation of a series of electronically and/or sterically distinct borenium&#8208;type species based on a simple 2&#8208;arylpyridine scaffold. Corresponding arylpyridine was firstly subjected to electrophilic borylation (BBr3 / i&#8208;Pr2NEt) and formed BBr2 chelate was reduced with LiAlH4 to yield arylpyridine boron dihydride. Elimination of one hydride led to Lewis acidic borenium&#8208;like products. Four methods of hydride elimination were evaluated and influence of counterions on reactivity, Lewis acidic and luminescent properties was assessed both experimentally and computationally. Arylpyridine chelates featuring weakly coordinating counterions exhibit fluorescent properties upon UV irradiation. Several general trends were inferred to modulate emission wavelength and fluorescence quantum yield. Based on our observations, we have devised and prepared borenium&#8208;type fluorophores with yellow&#8208;green fluorescence and quantum yields up to 93%.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Peptide Binding Motifs for Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate Using&#160;Phage Display</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective control over crystallization in complex multicomponent systems such as hydrating cements is a key issue in modern material science. In this context, rational selection&#8208;based approaches appear highly promising in the quest for new additive chemistries. Here we have used phage display to identify peptide structures showing high affinity to adsorb on the surfaces of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (also referred to as bassanite), an important hydraulic binder employed in large scales by the construction industry. The results suggest a triplet of amino acids consisting of aspartic acid, serine and leucine, to maintain strong interactions with the surfaces of hemihydrate particles. This notion is confirmed by actual hydration experiments, in which the identified peptide motif provides strictly selective effects during the transformation of bassanite into more stable gypsum. Our work thus contributes to a better understanding of hydraulic binders and their required improvement for a sustainable future.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions with Guanidino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) reactions are of importance for the construction of new carbon&#8208;element bonds in synthetic organic chemistry. In this work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of several redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecules (GFAs) for use in DC (C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O) reactions. In a systematic approach, we first characterize the new DC reagents in all relevant redox and protonation states, and compare their performance in competitive test proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Then, their use in four different DC reactions with different mechanisms is evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocompatible Flash Chemiluminescent Assay Enabled by Sterically Hindered Spiro&#8208;Strained&#8208;Oxetanyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dioxetane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminescence is the emission of light that occurs as a result of a chemical reaction. Depending on the rate of chemiexcitation, light emission can occur as a long&#8208;lasting,&#160;glow&#8208;type reaction or a rapid, highly intense flash&#8208;type reaction. Assays using a flash&#8208;type mode of action provide enhanced detection sensitivity compared to those using a glow&#8208;type mode. Recently, our group discovered that applying spiro&#8208;strain to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes significantly increases their chemiexcitation rate. However, further examination of the structure&#8208;activity relationships revealed that the spiro&#8208;strain severely compromises the chemical stability of the 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. We hypothesized that a combination of spiro&#8208;strain, steric hindrance, and an electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, will result in a chemically stable spiro&#8208;strained dioxetane with an accelerated chemiexcitation rate. Indeed, spiro&#8208;fused tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl exhibited a 128&#8208;fold faster chemiexcitation rate compared to adamantyl while maintaining similar chemical stability, with a half&#8208;life of over 400 hours in PBS 7.4 buffer at room temperature. Turn&#8208;on probes composed of tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl spiro&#8208;dioxetane exhibited significantly improved chemical stability in bacterial and mammalian cell media compared to previously developed dioxetane probes fused to a cyclobutyl unit. The superior chemical stability enables a tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl dioxetane probe to detect &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity with enhanced sensitivity in E. coli&#160;assays and leucine aminopeptidase activity in cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Phase Transfer of Oppositely Charged FeII4L6 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination cages and their encapsulated cargo can be manoeuvred between immiscible liquid layers in a process referred to as phase transfer. Among the stimuli reported to drive phase transfer, counterion exchange is the most widespread. This method exploits the principle that counterions contribute strongly to the solubility preferences of coordination cages, and involves exchanging hydrophilic and hydrophobic counterions. Nevertheless, phase transfer of anionic cages remains relatively unexplored, as does selective phase transfer of individual cages from mixtures. Here we compare the phase transfer behaviour of two FeII4L6 cages with the same size and geometry, but with opposite charges. As such, this study presents a rare example wherein an anionic cage undergoes phase transfer upon countercation exchange. We then combine these two cages, and demonstrate that their quantitative separation can be achieved by inducing selective phase transfer of either cage. These results represent unprecedented control over the movement of coordination cages between different physical compartments, and are anticipated to inform the development of next&#8208;generation supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Phototoxicity in BODIPY&#8208;perylene Charge Transfer Dyads by Combined Iodination and Mesylation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uptake and phototoxicity of a family of BODIPY&#8208;perylene charge transfer dyads are compared in live cancer non&#8208;cancer cell lines to evaluate their performance in Imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The impact of iodination and mesylation of the meso position of the compounds on their optical properties, cell uptake and toxicity are compared. Notably, across all derivatives the probes were minimally dark toxic up to 50 &#181;M, (the maximum concentration tested), but exhibited outstanding phototoxicity with nanomolar IC50 values and impressive phototoxic indices (PI, ratio of dark IC50 to light IC50), with best performance for the mesylated iodinated derivative. This compound, MB2PI had a PI of &gt;218 and &gt;8.9 in MCF&#8208;7 cells and in tumor spheroids respectively. This is significantly higher than non&#8208;iodinated analogue, M2P, in MCF&#8208;7 cells with an observed PI of &gt;109 and slightly higher than MB2PI in spheroids with a PI of &gt;8.. This compound also showed interesting emission spectral variation with localisation that responded to stimulation of inflammation. Additional studies confirmed efficient singlet oxygen generation by the BODIPYs, suggesting a Type II mechanism of phototoxicity. Overall, the data indicates that combining charge transfer and iodination is an effective strategy for enhancing phototherapeutic capacity of &#160;BODIPY PS.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organomercury contamination in wastewater is a longstanding global concern, prompting the establishment of the Mi&#8208;namata Convention in 2013, following the tragic Minamata Bay incident in Japan. Despite numerous proposed solutions, the development of an affordable and convenient adsorbent remains a challenge. Sulfur, being one of the most abundant elements globally, has shown promise in mercury adsorption in previous research. This study delves into the influence of light exposure on the process of mercury adsorption. Our findings reveal that exposure to UV&#8208;A wavelengths (315 nm &#8211; 400 nm), in combination with the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2), enhances the adsorption capacity of a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer. The maximum observed adsorption capacity reached 47 mg/g under these conditions. Notably, the presence of TiO2 and UV exposure did not significantly impact the adsorption of inorganic mercury and gold.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Chemical and Electrochemical Limitations in Sulfide Solid State Electrolytes: A Critical Review on Current Status and Manufacturing Scope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have gained recognition for their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, issues such as safety concerns, dendrite formation, and limited operational temperatures necessitate alternative solutions. A promising approach involves replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes (SEs). SEs represent a transformative shift in battery technology, offering stability, safety, and expanded temperature ranges. They effectively mitigate dendrite growth, enhancing battery reliability and lifespan. SEs also improve energy density, making them crucial for applications like portable gadgets, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage. However, challenges such as ionic conductivity, chemical and thermal stability, mechanical strength, and manufacturability must be addressed. This review paper briefly identifies SE types, discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and explores ion transport fundamentals and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) production challenges. It comprehensively analyzes sulfide SEs (SSEs), focusing on recent advancements, chemical and electrochemical challenges, and potential future improvements. Electrochemical reactions, electrolyte materials, compositions, and cell designs are critically assessed for their impact on battery performance. The review also addresses challenges in ASSB production. The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of SSEs, laying the groundwork for advancing sustainable and efficient energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Assembly of Three&#8208;component Coordination Polymers as Heterogeneous Catalysts for CO2 Cycloaddition and Cyanosilylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new coordination polymers based on 5&#8208;(((1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)amino) isophthalic acid (H3L) and auxiliary ligands (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), namely, {[Zn(HL)(phen)(H2O)]&#183;2H2O}n (CP 1), {[Ni(HL)(phen)(H2O)]}n (CP 2), {[Ni(HL)(2,2'&#8208;bpy)(H2O)]&#183;2H2O}n (CP 3) and {[Cd(HL)(4,4'&#8208;bpy)0.5(H2O)]&#183;2H2O}n (CP 4) were rationally assembled. Furthermore, these four CPs were screened as heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition and cyanosilylation reactions under mild conditions. The catalytic experiments showed that CP 1 had the better catalytic performance, excellent substrate tolerance and recyclability for the above two reactions. It is speculated that the excellent activity of CP 1 may be due to the open Lewis base site and the Lewis acidic characteristics of the zinc (II) center. After five cycles, the catalytic activities of CP 1 did not significantly decrease, and the structures remained unchanged. Therefore, the CP 1 was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A Type [7]Helicene&#8208;like Imide Derivatives with Tunable Photophysical Properties and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes and their derivatives show great application prospects as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, but their fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FLs) need a breakthrough urgently. Herein, we reported a series of D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A type helical luminescent emitters by combining the [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor with five different donors. The obtained five emitters display blue&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence and markedly enhanced &#934;FL. Notably, TPA&#8208;NiBTI exhibits the maximum &#934;FL in solution, while TPE&#8208;NiBTI achieves a maximum &#934;FL in the solid state. Their two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit remarkable CPL activities, and their doped PS film both displayed doubled &#934;FLs. Among them, [(P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI]&#8208;doped PS film exhibits the maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) value of 9.0&#215;10&#8722;4 and the maximum &#934;FL of 22%. This molecular design strategy presents a promising approach to improving the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives, thereby facilitating their potential application into chiral optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity in Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Aniline&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes induced by d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers has traditionally been associated with the vinylidene pathway. However, recent evidence suggests that d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers can also activate alkynes through non&#8208;vinylidene pathways. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation into the reactions between the Ru(II) complex [Ru([9]aneS3)(bpy)(OH2)]2+ and 2&#8208;alkynylanilines. Our study revealed that the selectivity between the vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways can be tuned by reaction temperature, substrate, and solvent polarity. This strategic control allows for the preferential formation of either C2&#8208; or C3&#8208;metalated indole zwitterion complexes. Additionally, we identified a rare decyclization mechanism that enables the conversion of C2&#8208;metalated indoles to C3&#8208;metalated indoles, underscoring the significance of product stability in these pathways. Overall, this work demonstrates practical approaches to control the preference between vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways, which is crucial for the design of new catalysts and metalated heterocyclic complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Innovative On&#8208;Resin and in Solution Peptidomimetics Synthesis via Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays, peptidomimetics are widely studied, being useful tools in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. The coupling between a carboxylic acid with an amine to form a peptide bond is the most common reaction to obtain peptides/peptidomimetics. In this work, we have investigated an innovative metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed carbamoylation to form peptidomimetics thanks to the reaction between dihydropyridines functionalized with amino acids (or peptide sequences) and differently functionalized imines. As the organic photocatalyst, we used 4CzIPN, a donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene vastly used in photoredox catalysis. By easily modulating the amino acid (or peptide sequence), which is directly attached to the dihydropyridine, we proposed this key&#8208;reaction as new valuable method to obtain peptidomimetics, in situ building the not&#8208;natural portion of the sequence. Moreover, we successfully employed this methodology in solid phase peptide synthesis, both inserting the new photoredox&#8208;generated amino acid at the end or in the middle of the sequence. Peptides with different lengths and secondary structures were prepared, proving the success of this approach, even in sterically hindered environment. Herein, to the best of our knowledge, we describe the first photocatalytic protocol which allows the building of the peptide backbone, with the possibility of simultaneously inserting a non&#8208;coded amino acid in the sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of BODIPY and Bis(BF2) Chromophores by Using Arylazosulfones in a Sunflow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the importance of BODIPYs and BIS(BF2)&#8208;based chromophores for biological applications and the limited related synthetic strategies toward functionalization, we report an environmentally friendly and practical protocol to promote their direct arylation under sunlight with arylazosulfones as aryl radical surrogates. In total, twenty&#8208;two arylated compounds were obtained under the established conditions including the chromophores BODIPY and BOPPY.

BODIPYs have a well&#8208;established role in biological sciences as chemosensors and versatile biological markers due to their chemical reactivity, which allows for fine&#8208;tuning of their photophysical characteristics. In this work, we combined the unique reactivity of arylazo sulfones with the advantages of a &#8220;sunflow&#8221; reactor to develop a fast, efficient, and versatile method for the photochemical arylation of BODIPYs and other chromophores. This approach resulted in red&#8208;shifted emitting fluorophores due to extended electronic delocalization at the 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of the BODIPY core. This method represents an advantageous approach for BODIPY functionalization compared to existing strategies.

&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of BODIPYs and BIS(BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-based chromophores for biological applications and the limited related synthetic strategies toward functionalization, we report an environmentally friendly and practical protocol to promote their direct arylation under sunlight with arylazosulfones as aryl radical surrogates. In total, twenty-two arylated compounds were obtained under the established conditions including the chromophores BODIPY and BOPPY.

         <title>Review on Catalytic Meinwald Rearrangement of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review encapsulates the applications of Meinwald rearrangement and the rearranged products as precursors of carbonyl compounds for the further transformations. It is expected that this review can inspire chemists to continuously contribute to this field and further promote the development of Meinwald rearrangement, and provide efficient access to high&#8208;value molecules.







Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed tremendous development within epoxides. Among the many known reactions involving epoxide, Meinwald rearrangements represent one of the most important and attractive approaches, which can transform epoxides into versatile carbonyl compounds. Given the high efficiency of this protocol, substantial efforts have been made by researchers by utilizing multiple catalyst systems. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the Meinwald rearrangement (from 2014 onward), along with detailed discussions on mechanistic insights. This review aims to highlight the importance and value of these methodologies, thereby promoting further investigation and application.

         <title>Synergistic Nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8208;Co Heterojunctions for Boosting the Selectivity in Hydrogenation of Nitrostyrenes and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;metal oxide interface catalysts are in high demand for advanced catalytic applications due to their multi&#8208;component active sites, which facilitate synergistic cooperation where a single component alone cannot effectively promote the desired reaction. Demonstrated herein graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8208;Co as highly efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of nitro styrenes/nitro arenes to amino styrenes/arenes under mild reaction conditions (0.5 MPa and 100 &#176;C in 1:1 THF/water). Charge relocalization at the Co&#8208;CoO&#8208;Mn3O4 heterojunction interfaces, primarily driven by Mn3O4, significantly improves reaction selectivity. Replacing Mn3O4 with MnO or using other supported bimetallic CoMnOx catalysts decreases selectivity, leading to the formation of a mixture of products. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable selectivity in converting nitro groups to amines, even in the presence of highly reactive functional groups such as C=C, O&#8208;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. It also exhibited high yields, multiple reusability, and a broad substrate scope. This study demonstrates how Mn3O4, in synergy with CoO&#8208;Co, fine&#8208;tunes selectivity, paving the way for the development of advanced metal&#8208;metal oxide interface catalysts to enhance both selectivity and efficiency in organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of dissolving metal electrodes for the direct electrochemical synthesis of metal complexes has been used widely in the last decade. A major benefit of the electrochemical approach is the minimal by&#8208;products resulting from the synthesis. As such, metal complexes can be produced on&#8208;demand and used directly in catalysis without the need for purification. Furthermore, the electrochemical method enables the production of metal complexes that cannot be synthesized using other methods, including those with base&#8208;sensitive ligands. General principles of the electrochemical method and recent advances in the field are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Silica Film with a TGBA* Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Twisted grain boundary (TGB) phases exhibit highly frustrated and complex liquid crystal structures, and have attracted enormous interest because of their unique internal structure, textures and properties. However, among the few real concerns related to these interesting structures, applying them to prepare polymer&#8208;stabilized colored liquid crystal films has been challenging. Herein, the organic&#8722;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure were prepared using two organosilanes and one chiral additive under an acidic condition. The structural color of the films can be adjusted by varying the polycondensation temperature and the concentration of the chiral additive. A structurally colored pattern was prepared by the inject printing, which was suitably applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination or Not in Small Molecule Solar Cells: Achieving a Higher Efficiency with Halogen&#8208;free End Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorination is an efficient strategy for improving organic solar cells (OSCs) efficiency, particularly by fluorinating the end group of emerging nonfullerene acceptors. Here, the fluorination effect was investigated by using small molecule donors with fluorine&#8208;free (SBz) and fluorinated (SBz&#8208;F) end groups, paired with the emerging nonfullerene acceptor Y6. Interestingly and unexpectedly, fluorination of the end group negatively affects OSCs efficiency, with fluorine&#8208;free SBz:Y6 OSCs achieving a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.05% compared to the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8208;F:Y6 blends (PCE = 9.61%). Analysis of space&#8208;charge limited currents reveals lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobility in SBz&#8208;F:Y6 compared to the SBz:Y6 blends. These findings are further supported by charge recombination dynamics and donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Photoactivatable Green&#8208;Emitting BODIPY Based on Directed Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Activation and its Application to Live Dynamic Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable fluorescent probes are valuable tools in bioimaging for tracking cells down to single molecules and for single molecule localization microscopy. For the latter application, green emitting dyes are in demand. We herein developed an efficient green&#8208;emitting photoactivatable furanyl&#8208;BODIPY (PFB) and we established a new mechanism of photoactivation called Directed Photooxidation Induced Activation (DPIA) where the furan is photo&#8208;oxidized in a directed manner by the singlet oxygen produced by the probe. The efficient photoconverter (93&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 510 nm, 49% yield conversion) is functionalizable and allowed targeting of several subcellular structures and organelles, which were photoactivated in live cells. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of PFB in super&#8208;resolution imaging by performing PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Access to Terminal Nitroalkanes via Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydronitration and Hydronitroalkylation of Alkenes Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The evolution of catalysis and functional group transfer reagents play a significant role in the development of anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, facilitating the access to value&#8208;added molecules. We herein report the first rational design of a modular intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitration of alkenes, enabling the direct synthesis of terminal nitroalkanes under visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. By employing the redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide, the produced nitryl radicals, in the presence of an olefin and a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediator, lead to an anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition with complete regioselectivity. Furthermore, we present results demonstrating the use of this catalytic system for chain expansion via anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition, utilizing substituted bromonitroalkanes as commercially available reagents. These transformations effectively address a gap in synthetic chemistry, enabling the direct synthesis of nitroalkanes from a variety of unactivated ole&#64257;ns in both complex molecules and unfunctionalized commodity chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aldehydes with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives is described using nickel&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;couplings between various alkyl/aryl aldehydes and aryl iodides. Performed in an electrochemical cell equipped with an iron anode and a nickel cathode, this electrocatalytic variant led to the scalemic targeted products in the presence of 2,2&#8208;bis((4R,5S)&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetonitrile (L2), as enantiopure cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of a pre&#8208;catalyst, for instance the [Ni(II)(L2)2] complex, with L2 as an anionic bisoxazolinate ligand, confirms the chemical formulation of one nickel surrounded by two ligands. The redox behavior of the new Ni complexes generated in situ was first assessed by cyclic voltammetry showing a redox wave at ca. &#8208;1.5 V that can be assigned to the two&#8208;electron reduction of the Ni(II) center to the Ni(0) state. Oxidative addition between the electrogenerated Ni(0) complex and aryl iodide was evidenced. An intense current was observed in presence of a mixture of the two substrates pertaining an electrocatalytic process. Interestingly, we found that the sacrificial iron anode plays a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving the Structure of a Guanine Quadruplex in TMPRSS2 Messenger RNA by Circular Dichroism and Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of a guanine quadruplex in the opening reading frame of the messenger RNA coding for the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) may pave the way to original anticancer and host&#8208;oriented antiviral strategy. Indeed, TMPRSS2 in addition to being overexpressed in different cancer types, is also related to the infection of respiratory viruses, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, by promoting the cellular and viral membrane fusion through its proteolytic activity. The design of selective ligands targeting TMPRSS2 messenger RNA requires a detailed knowledge, at atomic level, of its structure. Therefore, we have used an original experimental&#8208;computational protocol to predict the first resolved structure of the parallel guanine quadruplex secondary structure in the RNA of TMPRSS2, which shows a rigid core flanked by a flexible loop. This represents the first atomic scale structure of the guanine quadruplex structure present in TMPRSS2 messenger RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Reduction of NOx by NH3 with Unity Conversion on Nanofilament MnO2/Activated Semi&#8208;Coke Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique nanofilament MnO2 grown on activated semi&#8208;coke demonstrates a marked 100&#8201;% conversion rate of NO at low temperatures down to 70&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C in NH3, resulting from the promoted interaction of NO with NH3 on the catalytic sites.







Abstract
Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with NH3 at low temperatures remains a crucial goal for industrial applications. However, effective catalysts operating at 70&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C are rarely reported, limiting SCR scenarios to high&#8208;temperature conditions. Herein, we report a unique MnO2 nanofilament catalyst grown on activated semi&#8208;coke synthesized via a one&#8208;step in&#8197;situ hydrothermal approach, which exhibits a stable and marked 100&#8201;% conversion rate of NO to N2 with 100&#8201;% selectivity at 90&#8201;&#176;C, superior to the other prepared structures (nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes). Temperature&#8208;programmed desorption shows a large number of acid sites on MnO2(NFs)/ASC, benefiting the formation of NH4+ ions. Meanwhile, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals the activation of NO with O2 to form bidentate nitrate/bridging nitrate NO2 intermediates via bidentate nitrate species, triggering the Fast SCR with NH3 at low temperatures. Such an effective, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and low&#8208;cost catalyst paves a new pathway for low&#8208;temperature SCR for a wide range of application scenarios.

         <title>Ficini Reaction with Acrylates for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Aminocyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe herein the first catalytic Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates. This approach enables the formation of stable tri&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and subsequent selective synthesis of aminocyclobutanes with unique stereochemical patterns.







Abstract
The first Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates is reported herein. The reaction is catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 acting as a Lewis acid and is giving access to stable tri&#8208;substituted aminocyclobutenes in high yield. The resulting products can be hydrogenated and epimerized under basic conditions or in presence of a Lewis acid, providing two distinct trans&#8208; aminocyclobutane monoester stereoisomers in high yield and diastereoisomeric ratio (up to quantitative yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).

         <title>Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for NADH Regeneration by Hydrogen in a Redox Flow Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores enhancing NADH regeneration for industrial chemical production by immobilizing [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ onto a 3D metal&#8208;organic framework (NU&#8208;1000) on graphite felt and utilizing a gas diffusion electrode to efficiently oxidize H2, enabling effective NADH regeneration and highly efficient enzymatic synthesis of L&#8208;lactate in a flow bioreactor. This method achieves significant turnover numbers (TTN) and turnover frequencies (TOF), providing valuable insights for building efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.







Abstract
The electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ holds significant promise for the industrial synthesis of chiral chemicals. However, challenges persist due to the high consumption of NADH and the limited efficiency of its cyclic regeneration, which currently hinder widespread application. To address these obstacles, based on in&#8208;situ growth of 3D ordered metal&#8208;organic framework (NU&#8208;1000) on the surface of graphite felt, [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ were immobilized on the Zr6 nodes of NU&#8208;1000 by solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation (SALI), and applied in a flow bioreactor. Moreover, we employ a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to oxidize H2, providing a clean proton source for the electrochemical regeneration of NADH. Consequently, highly efficient enzymatic electrocatalytic synthesis of L&#8208;lactate was achieved when coupled with L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a model reaction, and the total turnover number (TTN) reached 19600 and 1750 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+ after 48&#8197;h, corresponding to a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2350&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 210&#8197;h&#8722;1 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+, respectively. This work provides new insights for the construction of efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.

To address these obstacles, based on in-situ growth of 3D ordered metal-organic framework (NU-1000) on the surface of graphite felt, [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; were immobilized on the Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nodes of NU-1000 by solvent-assisted ligand incorporation (SALI), and applied in a flow bioreactor. Moreover, we employ a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to oxidize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, providing a clean proton source for the electrochemical regeneration of NADH. Consequently, highly efficient enzymatic electrocatalytic synthesis of L-lactate was achieved when coupled with L-lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a model reaction, and the total turnover number (TTN) reached 19600 and 1750 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; after 48&#8197;h, corresponding to a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2350&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 210&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This work provides new insights for the construction of efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binary and Ternary Deep Eutectic Solvents for Methylene Green Electropolymerization on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes: Optimization, Characterization and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary deep eutectic solvent is used for the electropolymerization of methylene green on carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes. Modified electrode characterization is by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. It is successfully used as a sensor for simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid and acetaminophen in pharmaceutical samples by differential pulse voltammetry.







Abstract
Choline chloride (ChCl) based binary and ternary deep eutectic solvents (DES) were evaluated for methylene green electropolymerization with oxalic acid (OA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as hydrogen bond donors. Binary DES ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;OA in molar ratios 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;EG 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 and ternary DES (tDES) in different molar ratios and percentages of water were evaluated. The highest polymer growth was in ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;OA&#8201;:&#8201;EG&#8208;tDES with 13% added water, that had a lower viscosity and higher ionic conductivity when associated with HCl as dopant. This enhanced the formation of more cation radicals and, consequently, more polymer formation. The PMG/MWCNT/GCE&#8208;tDES sensor was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) by differential pulse voltammetry in the concentration range 1&#8197;&#956;M&#8211;200&#8197;&#956;M, with detection limits of 0.37&#8197;&#956;M and 0.49&#8197;&#956;M for 5&#8208;ASA and APAP, respectively. The sensor demonstrated good repeatability, reproducibility and stability, and was successfully applied in pharmaceutical formulations.

         <title>The Solid&#8208;State Multi&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching from a [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Based Triarylborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based triarylborane, which is modified by an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino (NMe2) and an electron&#8208;accepting [(2&#8208;dimesityllboryl)phenyl]ethynyl at the pseudo&#8208;gem position of [2.2]paracyclophane skeleton, can be switched among four bright fluorescent colors in the solid state (&#934;F=0.31&#8211;0.87) by combination of the tricolor mechanochromic fluorescence and acidochromic fluorescence.







Abstract
The fluorophores, the fluorescence of which can be switched between multi bright colors in the solid state, show promising applications not only in the sophisticated multicolor display but also in the advanced encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems. However, it is very challenging to obtain such fluorophores. Herein, we disclose such an example, g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp, which contains an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino (NMe2) and an electron&#8208;accepting [(2&#8208;dimesitylboryl)phenyl]acetyl at the pseudo&#8208;gem position of [2.2]paracyclophane skeleton. This molecule can display tricolor mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) due to the different responses of the mechanically ground amorphous state to heating and solvent&#8208;fuming. Owing to the absence of intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions in the solid state, the fluorescence efficiency is very high irrespective of its morphological state (&#934;F=0.60&#8211;0.87). Moreover, this molecule also displays reversible acidochromic luminescence (ACL) by protonation and deprotonation of NMe2 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylamine (TEA), respectively. The protonated sample fluoresces (&#934;F=0.31) at much shorter wavelength due to the interruption of intramolecular charge transfer process. Therefore, with the combination of tricolor MCL and ACL properties, the solid&#8208;state emission of g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp can be switched among four bright fluorescence colors of yellow, green, cyan and blue via treatment with appropriate stimulus.

         <title>Dual Aliovalent Dopants Cu, Mn Engineered Eco&#8208;Friendly QDs for Ultra&#8208;Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell quantum dots (QDs) with Cu and Mn tailors their optical properties for anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The engineered QDs exhibit bright orange photoluminescence at 606&#8197;nm with improved color purity and stability. Integrated into PMMA, they create durable luminescent inks suitable for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Doping in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using optically active dopants tailors their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties beyond what is achieved by controlling size, shape, and composition. Herein, we synergistically modulated the optical properties of eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell QDs by incorporating Cu&#8208;doping and Mn&#8208;alloying into their core and shell to investigate their use in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. The engineered &#8220;Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe&#8221; core/shell QDs exhibit an intense bright orange photoluminescence (PL) emission centered at 606&#8197;nm, with better color purity than the undoped and individually doped core/shell QDs. The average PL lifetime is significantly extended to 201&#8197;ns, making it relevant for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. PL studies reveal that in Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe, the photophysical emission arises from the Cu state via radiative transition from the Mn 4T1 state. Integration of Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs into poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) serves as versatile smart concealed luminescent inks for both writing and printing patterns. The features of these printed patterns using Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs persisted after 10&#8197;weeks of water&#8208;soaking and retained 70&#8201;% of PL emission intensity at 170&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This work provides an efficient approach to enhance both the emission and the stability of eco&#8208;friendly QDs via dopant engineering for fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Regulated Formation of Metal/Metal&#8208;Oxo Nodes in Two Indium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Syntheses, Structures, Selective Gas Adsorption and Fluorescence Sensor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear and multinuclear indium&#8208;based MOFs with water stability were synthesized by using DMA and DMF/DMSO/H2O mixed solvent, respectively. Two MOFs both exhibit good sensing properties for acetone and Fe3+ ions. Meanwhile, the multinuclear indium&#8208;based MOF also demonstrates exceptional CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity.







Abstract
Two water&#8208;stable indium metal&#8208;organic frameworks, (NH2Me2)3[In3(BTB)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) and (NH2Me2)9[In9O6(BTB)8(H2O)4(DMSO)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;27DMSO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;21H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2) (BTB=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzoate) with 3D interpenetrated structure has been constructed by regulating solvents. Structure analysis revealed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 has a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure with a single metal core, while In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 features an octahedron cage constructed by three kinds of metal clusters to further form a 3D structure. The fluorescence investigations showed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 are potential MOF&#8208;based fluorescent sensors to detect acetone and Fe3+ ions in EtOH or water with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, recyclability and a low limit of detection. Moreover, the fluorescence mechanisms of In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 toward acetone and Fe3+ ions were further explained. In addition, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 has higher thermal and framework stability than In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. The activated In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 presents a high BET surface area of 998.82&#8197;m2g&#8722;1 and a pore size distribution of 8 to 16&#8197;&#197;. At the same time, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 exhibits high selective CO2 adsorption for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption sites and adsorption isotherms were predicted using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and the adsorption energy of the lowest&#8208;energy adsorption configuration was calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

&lt;p&gt;Mononuclear and multinuclear indium-based MOFs with water stability were synthesized by using DMA and DMF/DMSO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mixed solvent, respectively. Two MOFs both exhibit good sensing properties for acetone and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Meanwhile, the multinuclear indium-based MOF also demonstrates exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity and selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two water-stable indium metal-organic frameworks, (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[In&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BTB)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;b&gt;(In-MOF-1)&lt;/b&gt; and (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;[In&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(BTB)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;27DMSO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;21H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;b&gt;(In-MOF-2)&lt;/b&gt; (BTB=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;-benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoate) with 3D interpenetrated structure has been constructed by regulating solvents. Structure analysis revealed that &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-1&lt;/b&gt; has a three-dimensional (3D) structure with a single metal core, while &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-2&lt;/b&gt; features an octahedron cage constructed by three kinds of metal clusters to further form a 3D structure. The fluorescence investigations showed that &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-2&lt;/b&gt; are potential MOF-based fluorescent sensors to detect acetone and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in EtOH or water with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, recyclability and a low limit of detection. Moreover, the fluorescence mechanisms of I&lt;b&gt;n-MOF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-2&lt;/b&gt; toward acetone and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were further explained. In addition, &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-2&lt;/b&gt; has higher thermal and framework stability than &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-1&lt;/b&gt;. The activated &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-2&lt;/b&gt; presents a high BET surface area of 998.82&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a pore size distribution of 8 to 16&#8197;&#197;. At the same time, &lt;b&gt;In-MOF-2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits high selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption sites and adsorption isotherms were predicted using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and the adsorption energy of the lowest-energy adsorption configuration was calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Active Immobilized Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization: Neutral Single Site Y(III) Complex Bearing Bulky Silylallyl Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing of a highly active neutral yttrium supported catalyst for ethylene polymerization can be achieved by electronic and steric tuning of the ligand attached to the yttrium metal. This catalyst was implemented at a pre&#8208;industrial scale, demonstrating unprecedented activity and the desired high&#8208;density polyethylenes (HDPE) with a broad molar mass distribution, which is advantageous for resin processing.







Abstract
Exploring the surface organometallic chemistry on silica of highly electrophilic yttrium complexes is a relatively uncommon endeavor, particularly when focusing on tris&#8208;alkyl complexes characterized by Y&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;alkyl bonds. A drawback with this class of complexes once grafted on silica, is the frequent occurrence of alkyl transfer by ring opening of siloxane groups, resulting in a mixture of species. Herein, we employed a more stable homoleptic yttrium allyl complex bearing bulky &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl ligand to limit this transfer reaction. This strategy has been validated by comparing the reactivity between [Y{ &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] and [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] with SiO2&#8211;700, where the undesired alkyl transfer reaction occurred for [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] leading to a bipodal [(&#8801;SiO)2Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)] as major surface species, 2, while [Y{ &#951; 3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] resulted selectively in a monopodal species, [(&#8801;SiO)Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}2], 1. The materials obtained were characterized by DRIFT, solid state NMR, mass balance analysis and EXAFS. Catalyst 1 showed high activity compared to 2 in ethylene polymerization. The catalytic performance of this neutral catalyst 1 was extended to pre&#8208;industrial scale in the presence of hydrogen and 1&#8208;hexene. An unprecedented activity, up to 7400&#8197;gPE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was obtained even with very low concentration of scavenger AliBu3 (TIBA/Y=1.2). The obtained HDPE exhibited desired spherical particle morphology with broad molar mass distribution.

         <title>Effects of Ring Functionalization in Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclophanes on the Binding Properties Toward Nucleotides and DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared and studied for binding of nucleoside triphosphates and double&#8208;stranded DNA. While the ortho&#8208;phenyl derivative showed high affinity for nucleoside triphosphates, the meta&#8208;derivative demonstrated GC&#8208;selectivity and an intercalation binding mode with DNA.







Abstract
Supramolecular recognition of nucleobases and short sequences is an emerging research field focusing on possible applications to treat many diseases. Controlling the affinity and selectivity of synthetic receptors to target desired nucleotides or short sequences is a highly challenging task. Herein, we elucidate the effect of substituents in the phenyl ring of the anthracene&#8208;benzene azacyclophane on the recognition of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and double&#8208;stranded DNA. We show that introducing phenyl rings increases the affinity for NTPs 10&#8208;fold and implements groove and intercalation binding modes with double&#8208;stranded DNA. NMR studies and molecular modeling calculations support the ability of cyclophanes to encapsulate nucleobases as part of nucleotides.

         <title>Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes Based on Xylenylamino Linked Dual Pyrazolate Chelates for Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional tetradentate chelates composed of two pyrazolate chelates and one xylenylamino linker were employed in preparation of Pt(II) complexes showing efficient ligand&#8208;centered &#960;&#960;* transition characteristics. Upon fabrication of OLED devices, Pt4N2 and Pt4N3 based devices delivered efficient cyan and green emission, with an EQEmax of 15.2&#8201;% and 11.2&#8201;%, respectively, affirming the successfulness of the tetradentate chelating strategy.







Abstract
In this work, we report the syntheses of three Pt(II) emitters, namely, Pt4N1, Pt4N2, and Pt4N3, to which their tetradentate chelates were assembled by linking two pyrazolate chelates with a single xylenylamino entity. Functionalization of Pt4N1 was achieved upon the addition of electronegative CF3 substituent on pyridinyl groups and switching to more electron&#8208;deficient pyrazinyl groups in giving Pt4N2 and Pt4N3, respectively. The vertically arranged xylenylamino entity has effectively suppressed the inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction, as shown by the single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses.

Abstract
Mild and inexpensive copper&#8208;catalyzed aromatization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening amination and oxygenation of spiro dihydroquinazolinones are presented, respectively. These protocols provide facile and atom&#8208;economical access to the aminated and the carbonyl&#8208;containing quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones in good yields with good functional group compatibility, which are difficult to obtain by conventional methods. Remarkably, a telescoped procedure involving the condensation and the ring&#8208;opening/functionalization for simple cycloalkanone was found to be accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway for this transformation.

         <title>Modification of an AIE Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Polarity of Lipid Droplets Based on a Series of Synthesized Aryl Naphthalizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluorescent probes were designed based on the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism to target LDs and detected cell polarity. The probes were modified using oligo&#8208;oligomeric PEG to increase biocompatibility, and the triphenylamine moiety enabled the probes to exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties. The Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited a high degree of sensitivity to polarity.







Abstract
Lipid droplets (LDs) are subcellular organelles that are dynamic and play a central role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. They also contribute to the transport and maturation of cellular proteins and are closely associated with several diseases. The important role of the cellular microenvironment in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Changes in cell polarity, particularly in organelles, have been found to be strongly linked to inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other illnesses. It is essential to check the polarity of the LDs. A series of arylated naphthalimide derivatives were synthesized using the Suzuki reaction. Modification of synthesized aryl naphthalimides using oligomeric PEG based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. A series of fluorescent probes were designed to target LDs and detect their polarity. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high sensitivity to polarity. The addition of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the probe not only significantly improved its solubility in water, but also effectively reduced its cytotoxicity. In addition, the probe exhibited excellent aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties and solvent discolouration effects. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high Pearson correlation coefficient (0.957163) in lipid droplet co&#8208;localization in cells. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 could be used as an effective hand tool to monitor cell polarity.

         <title>Fabrication of a Multi&#8208;Functional Separator Incorporating Crown ether&#8208; Polyoxometalate Supramolecular Compound for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP separator demonstrated the ability to synergistically capture and expedite the rapid conversion of lithium Polysulfides (LiPSs) during electrochemical processes. Moreover, the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular complex, through its crown ether array, has shown a notable degree of success in preventing POM catalyst leaching. This augmentation markedly enhances the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. As a result, the capacity remained significant even after 160 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C at a high sulfur loading density of 3.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, decreasing from 543.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8211;487.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a capacity decay rate of merely 0.006&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
Recently, research on polyoxometalates (POMs) has gained significant momentum. Owing to their properties as electronic sponges, POMs catalyst harbor substantial potential in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery research. However, POMs undergo a transformation into reduced heteropoly blue (HPB) during electrochemical reactions, which then dissolve into the electrolyte, resulting in catalyst loss. In this research, we amalgamated 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (CR6) with K3PW12O40, (KPW), synthesized a novel POM&#8208;based supramolecular compound, and integrated it with graphene oxide (GO) to fabricate a multi&#8208;functional composite polypropylene (PP) separator KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP. The crown ether array was employed to immobilize POM and construct ion transport channels, thereby enhancing the Li+ migration rate and capturing polysulfides. Subsequently, leveraging the stable structure and redox properties of POM, the polysulfide is catalyzed to transform and inhibit the shuttle effect, thereby protecting the Li anode. The lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular compound separators, exhibit enhanced capacity and stability (1073.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;C, and 81.5&#8201;% retention rate after 250 cycles). The battery (S loading: 3.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) presents an initial specific discharge capacity of 543.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C, with 89.8&#8201;% of the capacity retained after 160 cycles. This underlines the practical application potential of Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular materials in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Multilevel Dynamic System as Molecular Morning&#8208;After Timer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systems chemistry aims to develop molecular systems that display emerging properties arising from their network and absent in their individual constituents. Employing reversible chemistry under thermodynamic control represents a valuable tool for generating dynamic combinatorial libraries of interconverting molecules, which may exhibit intriguing collective behaviour. A simple dynamic combinatorial library was prepared using dithioacetal / thiol / disulfide exchanges. Because of the relative reactivities of these reversible reactions, the library constitutes a two&#8208;layer dynamic system with one layer active in an acid medium (thiol/dithioacetal exchange) and one layer active in a basic medium (thiol/disulfide exchange). This property enables the system to respond to momentary changes in acidity of the medium by activating different network regions, channeling some building blocks from one layer to another through shared thiol reagents (nodes). This momentaneous change in wiring affects the final steady state composition of the library, measured the next day, even though the event that caused it vanishes without leaving any residue. Therefore, the final composition of this dynamic system provides information about this transient past perturbation in the environment such as: when it occurred, how long it was, or how intense it was.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonization Synthesis of N, S Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Materials Derived from Agricultural Waste Peanut Shells for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass carbon has the advantages of wide source, low cost and environmental protection, and has been widely used in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this work, N and S co&#8208;doped carbon materials were prepared by using peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. When the peanut shell and activator were 2 g and 4 g, respectively, the prepared NSPC&#8208;4 had the largest specific surface area and special pore structure. Elemental analysis showed that the activator introduced more N, S and O atoms to the carbon material, and more heteroatoms helped to improve the surface structure of the carbon material and provide additional pseudocapacitance. In addition, NSPC&#8208;4 contains a short&#8208;range ordered graphite structure, which can provide excellent electrical conductivity. The electrochemical test results show that NSPC&#8208;4 has the largest specific capacitance. When the mass of the activator is higher than or below 4 g, the electrochemical performance of the carbon material will be reduced. The symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) assembled by NSPC&#8208;4 has an energy density of 8.3 Wh kg&#8208;1 when the power density is 350 W kg&#8208;1. The synthesis method is not only simple, green and economical, but also has important application value.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis of Luminescent Imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural variability of a compound class is an important criterion for the research into phosphor host lattices for phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). Especially, nitridophosphates and the related class of imidonitridophosphates are promising candidates. Recently, the ammonothermal approach has opened a systematic access to this substance class with larger sample quantities. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+. Its crystal structure is solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in space group Cc (no.&#160;9) with lattice parameters a&#160;=&#160;12.5250(3), b&#160;=&#160;12.5566(4), c&#160;=&#160;7.3882(2)&#160;&#197; and &#946;&#160;=&#160;102.9793(10)&#176;. For the first time, adamantane&#8208;type (imido)nitridophosphate anions [P4N8(NH)2]8&#8722; are observed next to metal ions other than alkali metals in a compound. The presence of imide groups in the structure and the identification of preferred positions for the hydrogen atoms are performed using a combination of quantum chemical calculations, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Eu2+ doped samples exhibit cyan emission (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;498&#160;nm, fwhm&#160;=&#160;50&#160;nm/1981&#160;cm&#8722;1) when excited with ultraviolet light with an impressive internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 41&#160;%, which represents the first benchmark for imidonitridophosphates and is promising for potential industrial application of this compound class.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoenabled self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic algaecides generated photosynthetic inhibition and oxidative stress for sustainable food security</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving food sustainability is one of the biggest challenges in the new millennium. Plant factory cultivation systems provide an alternative for food sustainability, while they often suffer from algal blooms. The overuse of conventional algaecides has caused significant environmental pollution and concerns about food security. Here, we design a nanoenabled metal&#8208;organic algaecide that is self&#8208;assembled from natural polyphenols and two functional metal ions for providing shading effects and delivering active ingredients synergistically to suppress algal blooms. Black wattle tannin (BWT) and Fe3+ ions are utilized to develop self&#8208;assembled FeBWT nanoalgaecides with significant shading effects for decreasing light transmission (up to 97%) and effectively inhibiting algal photosynthesis. Further, the FeBWT is functionalized with Cu2+ ions (bimetallic Cu/FeBWT) to target the algal cells and release Cu2+ ions via phenolic&#8208;mediated cell surface interactions, thus enhancing the inhibition efficiency. Importantly, the biosafety of Cu/FeBWT is demonstrated through toxicity tests on zebrafish and NIH3T3 cells. In our real&#8208;world field test, the Cu/FeBWT demonstrates high algal inhibition performance (&gt; 95%, over 30 days), and enhances the accumulation of food nutrients in model plant lettuces. Collectively, the supramolecular metal&#8208;organic nanoalgaecide provides a promise for nanoagrochemical application and promoting food sustainability and security.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;dependent Copper Nanoparticles Supported on Carbon Nanotubes with Balanced Cu+ and Cu0 Dual Sites for the Selective Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic carbonate hydrogenation offers an alternative for the efficient indirect CO2 utilization. In this study, a series of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported xCu/CNTs catalysts with different Cu loadings were fabricated using a convenient impregnation method, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate to methanol and ethylene glycol. The structural and physicochemical properties revealed that acid treatment of CNTs resulted in plentiful oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for copper species. The calcination process conducted under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of ternary CuO, Cu2O, and Cu composites, enhancing the metal&#8208;support interaction and facilitating the formation of balanced Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites as well as high active surface area after reduction. Contributed to the synergetic effect of balanced Cu+ and Cu0 species proved by density functional theory calculation and the electron&#8208;rich CNTs surface, the 40Cu/CNTs catalyst achieved strengthened catalytic performance with methanol yield of 83%, ethylene glycol yield of 99% at ethylene carbonate conversion of &gt;99%, and 150 h of long&#8208;term running stability. Consequently, CNTs supported Cu serve as efficient non&#8208;silica based catalyst for ester hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Photocatalytic CO 2 &#160;Reduction and&#160;H 2 O Oxidation&#160;under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of&#160;CO2,&#160;H2O,&#160;and solar energy is regarded as a sustainable route for converting CO2&#160;into chemical feedstocks,&#160;paving the way for carbon neutrality and reclamation. However, the simultaneous photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction and&#160;H2O oxidation&#160;under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is&#160;still&#160;a&#160;significant challenge. Researchers have carried out extensive exploration and achieved dramatic&#160;developments&#160;in this area. In this review, we first&#160;primarily elucidate the principles of&#160;two half&#8208;reactions&#160;in&#160;the photocatalytic conversion of CO2&#160;with H2O, i.e., CO2&#160;reduction&#160;by the photo&#8208;generated electrons and protons, and&#160;H2O oxidation&#160;by the photo&#8208;generated holes&#160;without sacrificial agents. Subsequently,&#160;the strategies to promote two half&#8208;reactions are summarized, including the vacancy/facet/morphology&#160;design, adjacent redox site&#160;construction, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction&#160;development. Finally, we present the advanced&#160;in situ characterizations and future perspectives in&#160;this field. This review aims&#160;to provide&#160;fresh insights into&#160;effectively&#160;simultaneous photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction and&#160;H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Preferential Formation of Three&#8208;layered Host&#8211;Guest Complexes of a Planar Dinuclear Metallohost with Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a planar macrocyclic dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost from the corresponding macrocyclic imine ligand containing two N2O2&#160;chelate coordination sites and an O6&#160;cation binding site like 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as well as peripheral hexyl groups. Due to the lipophilic nature of the hexyl groups, the metallohost was soluble in less polar media where its interaction with alkali metal ions was enhanced. The binding studies by NMR spectroscopy clearly showed its strong tendency to form multi&#8208;layered structures. The metallohost formed 2:1 and 1:1 (host/guest) complexes with Na+&#160;with the two&#8208;step binding constants of logK1&#160;= 6.6 and logK2&#160;= 3.0. In contrast, its complexation with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) preferentially gave 3:2 (host/guest) complexes when 2/3 equiv of the guest was present. The three&#8208;layered structures of these 3:2 complexes were well characterized by mass spectrometry and 2D COSY/ROESY experiments as well as DFT calculations, elucidating their unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost. Therefore, the three&#8208;layered structures were preferentially formed when larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) were complexed with the metallohost.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of Copper(II)&#8211;Nitrite Core Towards Nitric Oxide Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insights into the molecular mechanism and factors affecting nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at transition metal sites are essential for developing sustainable technologies relevant to NO&#8208;based therapeutics, waste water treatment, and agriculture. A set of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes&#160;1&#8211;4&#160;have been isolated employing tridentate pincer&#8208;type ligands (quL,&#160;pyL,&#160;ClArOL&#8211;,&#160;PhOL&#8211;) featuring systematically varied donors. Although the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the copper(II)&#8211;nitrite cores in&#160;1&#8211;4&#160;are comparable, electrochemical studies on complexes&#160;1&#8211;4&#160;reveal that redox properties of these complexes differ due to the changes in the&#160;s&#8208;donor abilities of the&#160;phenolate / N&#8208;heterocycle based donor sites.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insights into the molecular mechanism and factors affecting nitrite-to-NO transformation at transition metal sites are essential for developing sustainable technologies relevant to NO-based therapeutics, waste water treatment, and agriculture. A set of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes&#160;1&#8211;4&#160;have been isolated employing tridentate pincer-type ligands (quL,&#160;pyL,&#160;ClArOL&#8211;,&#160;PhOL&#8211;) featuring systematically varied donors.

         <title>Surface Modification of Gold Nanorods: Multifunctional Strategies and Application Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanorods (AuNRs), as an important type of gold nanomaterials, have attracted much attention in the nano field. Compared with gold nanoparticls, AuNRs have broader application potential due to their tunable localized surface plasmon resonance properties and anisotropic shapes. Yet, conventional synthesis methods using surfactants have limited the use of AuNRs in a variety of fields such as biomedical applications, plasma&#8208;enhanced fluorescence, optics and optoelectronic devices. To solve this problem and improve the stability and biocompatibility of AuNRs, researchers in recent years have used surface modification and functionalization to modify AuNRs, among which the introduction of organic ligands to prepare organic/gold hybrid nanorods has become an effective strategy. Organic materials have better toughness and easy processing, and by introducing organic ligands into the surface of AuNRs, the molecular&#8208;level composite of organic and inorganic materials can be realized, thus obtaining hybrid nanorods with excellent properties. This paper reviews the research progress of hybrid nanocomposites, and introduces the synthesis methods of AuNRs and the development of surface ligand modification, then summaries the applications of a wide variety of ligands. Also, the advantages and disadvantages of different ligands and their roles in further self&#8208;assembly processes are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Functionalized Triphenylmethyl Radicals Showing High Stability and Reversible Electrochemical Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a series of triphenylmethyl monoradicals incorporating varying numbers of peripheral perylene bisimide (PBI) substituents (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#183;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#183; and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#183;). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing PBI substituents significantly enhances the stability of these carbon radicals, enabling them to display exceptional electrochemical redox reversibility. Notably, the electronic interplay between the PBI substituents and the central triphenylmethyl core facilitates unique and reversible multi&#8208;step redox reactions. Among the reported redicals, the tris&#8208;PBI functionalized radical (3PBI&#8208;TTM&#183;) demonstrates the remarkable ability to accommodate up to seven electrons under negative potentials, forming high valence anions. This research pioneers the development of highly stable carbon radicals with superior electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction processes, presenting promising avenues for the advancement of electric energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical oxidation of UV filters: A first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A theoretical model is proposed to study the oxidation mechanisms of the organic UV filters BP3 and BP4 during electrochemical water treatment utilizing Car&#8208;Parrinello molecular dynamics. Factors such as the amount of solvent to be included and how to design the system with the least possible intervention are discussed. The stages of the proposed model consist of the optimization of the geometries by density functional theory methods, the equilibration of the structure immersed in a water box, the inclusion of the reactive species, and the analysis of the reaction energies of each reaction pathway. The ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations lead to several products, and some trends can be identified, in accordance with the well&#8208;known reactivity rules of organic chemistry. The products proposed in this work are intermediates in longer oxidative pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>The Changing Phases of Bromopentafluorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As part of a much larger study on non&#8208;covalent interactions in binary adducts, we have explored the solid&#8208;state structures of bromopentafluorobenzene (C6F5Br) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;PXRD), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXD). DSC data initially indicated a single solid&#8208;state phase below the freezing point, but revealed additional weak transitions upon heating. The crystal structures of three solid&#8208;state phases have been solved. The SXD data showed that phases I and IV are centrosymmetric, whilst phase II is polar. However, the structure of phase III remains elusive due to the changing phase behaviour of C6F5Br that is determined as much as by kinetics as thermodynamics. The results underline the need for multiple analytical techniques to study non&#8208;covalent interactions and offer valuable data for refining computational models in crystal structure prediction and machine learning. A comparison with the iodinated counterpart is also made.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlining Thionyl Tetrafluoride (SOF4) and Pentafluorooxosulfate [OSF5]&#8211; Anions Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one pot room temperature synthesis of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) from elemental fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) is reported. The selective decagram scale process (100 mmol) allows a quantitative preparation of SOF4 with high purity. The solid&#8208;state structure has also been elucidated and compared with the reported gas&#8208;phase one. The use of this reagent for the formation of the emerging pentafluorooxosulfate [cat][OSF5] anions led to the preparation of multiple ion&#8208;pairs (cat = Ag, NEt3Me, PPN, PPh4) in different organic solvents. The SuFEx reservoir ability of this anion was studied and by tuning the solvent system, the reactivity of pure thionyl tetrafluoride was observed using Ag[OSF5] in THF and acetone.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of fluorinated benzenesulfonamides were synthesized and characterized by their anti&#8208;amyloid potential. We investigated compound structure relationship for inhibiting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) aggregation, which is considered to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized molecules were effective at slowing down the A&#946; aggregation by extending its nucleation phase and reduced aggregate toxicity to SHSY&#8208;5Y cells.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide aggregation process by more than three&#8208;fold. We synthesized a series of ortho&#8208;para and meta&#8208;para double&#8208;substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross&#8208;sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;Earth Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphic depicts RE&#8208;CU&#8208;45, a rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;organic framework, which features 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid linkers and hexanuclear RE(III) clusters (RE(III)=Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Tm(III), Yb(III), Lu(III), and Y(III)). The MOF linker can be excited at 290&#8197;nm and, through the antenna effect, promote energy transfer to the RE(III) ions, leading to emission in the visible and/or near&#8208;infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.







Abstract
In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE=Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

         <title>Tetrel Bond Affects the Self&#8208;Assembly of Acetylcholine and its Analogues and is an Ancillary Interaction in Protein Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical findings show that the C atoms of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety of acetylcholine and some analogues form tetrel bonds that are robust enough to assemble cations into supramolecular infinite chains; similar tetrel bonds are present also in substrate/protein adducts, specifically they act as ancillary interactions in the binding of these &#8722;N+(CH3)3 containing compounds to proteins.







Abstract
The &#8722;N+(CH3)3 residue is present in acetylcholine (ACh) and in many of its analogues which are used as selective ACh agonist or antagonists for human therapy. The X&#8208;ray structures of four ACh derivatives show the presence of short and linear contacts between the C atoms of &#8722;N+(CH3)3 groups and lone pair possessing atoms. These contacts can be rationalized as tetrel bonds (TtBs) thanks to their geometric features. Interrogation of the Protein Data Bank suggests that similar &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts affect the details of the binding of ACh and its derivatives to proteins. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules, noncovalent interaction plot, and natural bond orbital analyses consistently confirm that the &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts observed in small molecule crystals and in substrate/protein complexes are attractive in nature and can be rationalized as TtBs. TtBs involving methyl groups of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety can be proposed as a new item in the palette of interactions allowing the compounds containing this pharmacophoric unit to bind to their target protein and/or to express their biological/pharmacological properties.

         <title>Tracking Microenvironmental Response on Self&#8208;Assembled Phthalocyanine Systems &#8211; Adaptive and Non&#8208;Adaptive Antibacterial Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, we investigate how self&#8208;assembled photosensitizers respond to changes in molecular crowding and presence of different bacteria. We observed that certain systems exhibit adaptive behavior and alter their photoinduced activity, while others do not, highlighting the impact of confined environments and intermolecular interactions on the relaxation pathways of excited states in photoactive molecules.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are accomplished.







Abstract
Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions.

     alt="Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N-Fused Cobalt Porphyrins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New single-site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N-fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro-reduction are accomplished.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure-activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy-consuming Haber-Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six-electron, six-proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N-fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Contrary to this, much harder-to-reduce N-fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CoNHF(PE)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single-site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported in comparison with the empty C360 and C362&#8722; cages. Among all [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6 6] C&#8722;C bonds the [5&#8208;5] bond is the most reactive bond in both the empty C36 and metallofullerene M@C36.







Abstract
Understanding the exohedral reactivity of metallofullerenes is crucial for its application in various fields. By systematically controlling the trapped species inside the fullerene its reactivity can be tamed. In this work we report the preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral reactivity in comparison with the neutral and the dianionic cage. The Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and all non&#8208;equivalent [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6&#8208;6] C&#8722;C bonds on the fullerene cage was considered for the analysis, by using density functional theory at the S12g/TZ2P level including COSMO solvation model to elucidate the complete mechanistic pathways. Our results indicate that the preferential position of the metal ion is at the position close to the upper hexagon, and that the general trend in the reactivity of bonds follows the order [5&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;6]. Moreover, the encapsulation of metal atoms further enhances the reactivity of these bonds, by lowering the LUMOs of the cage, hence maximizing the orbital interactions.

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Donepezil: A Green and Sustainable Strategy Featuring Heterogeneous Catalysis and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical, sequential, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil was developed using inexpensive precursors. Key elements included highly functional heterogeneous catalytic processes for condensation and hydrogenation, with water as the sole byproduct. Additionally, in&#8208;line treatments eliminated inhibitory factors, enabling seamless integration of the multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow reactions.







Abstract
An atom&#8208;economical sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil, a widely prescribed drug for Alzheimer's disease, was accomplished using inexpensive, commercially available precursors. This achievement was made possible by reconfiguring the synthetic route to include only heterogeneous catalytic addition and condensation reactions, with a particular emphasis on skeletal transformation and bond formation through hydrogenation processes. Notably, water was the sole byproduct in this synthesis. A crucial aspect of this work was the development of appropriate continuous&#8208;flow processes to achieve a one&#8208;flow synthesis. This was accomplished by implementing in&#8208;line treatments of the main reaction stream to eliminate inhibitory factors that could affect catalyst performance in the hydrogenation steps.
