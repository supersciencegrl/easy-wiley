         <title>Alkoxyphosphorane/Borane Cooperative Alkylations: A Frustrated Lewis Pair Version of the Mitsunobu Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkoxyphosphoranes, Ph2P(OR)(O2C6Cl4) and the borane B(C6F5)3 generate zwitterions which act as FLPs to effect the alkylation of nucleophiles affording C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;H and C&#8722;Cl coupling products. A DFT study confirms these reactions proceed via FLP activation pathway, generating an alkoxyphosphonium intermediate and effecting alkylation of the nucleophiles, akin to the Mitsunobu reaction.







Abstract
The combination of the alkoxyphosphoranes, Ph2P(OR)(O2C6Cl4) and the borane B(C6F5)3 generates the zwitterions 3 which act as FLP to effect the alkylation of several nucleophiles affording C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;H and C&#8722;Cl coupling products. A DFT study shows the reaction proceeds via an FLP activation pathway generating an alkoxyphosphonium intermediate which effects the alkylation of the nucleophiles, akin to the Mitsunobu reaction.

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution from Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Triply Donor&#8208;Substituted Tristriazolotriazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accelerating effect of heavy sulfur atoms on intersystem crossing leads to phosphorescence at room temperature even in solution from tristriazolotriazines decorated via thiophene bridges with three bulky peripheral donor units.







Abstract
Most organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters do not show their RTP in solution. Here, we incorporated sulfur&#8208;containing thiophene bridges between the donor and acceptor moieties in D3A&#8208;type tristriazolotriazines (TTTs). The thiophene inclusion increased the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated with the radiative T1&#8594;S0 pathway, allowing RTP to be observed in solution for all compounds, likely assisted by protection of the emissive TTT&#8208;thiophene core from the environment by the bulky peripheral donors.

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Alkaline&#8208;Earth Metal Amides Applying the In Situ Grignard Reagent Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. In addition, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups proved to be beneficial for the synthesis of calcium bis(amides). The addition of hydryl bromides or iodides to suspensions of calcium and imines in THF allows straightforward conversion to silyl&#8208;free calcium bis(amides) with bulky substituents.







Abstract
Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. For the synthesis of bulky amides alternative strategies are required and in the past, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups have been used to ease metalation reactions. The in&#8197;situ Grignard reagent formation in stirred suspensions of magnesium or calcium with hydryl halide and imine in THF allows the synthesis of a plethora of amides with bulky silyl&#8208;free substituents. Ball milling protocols partially favor competitive side reactions such as aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reactions. Calcium is the advantageous choice for the in&#8197;situ Grignard reagent formation and subsequent addition onto the imines yielding bulky calcium bis(amides) whereas the stronger reducing heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metals strontium and barium are less selective and hence, the aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reaction becomes competitive. Exemplary, the solid&#8208;state molecular structures of [(Et2O)Mg(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] and [(Et2O)2Ca(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] have been determined.

This straightforward catalytic protocol works under mild conditions resulting indole alkaloids in excellent yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This transformation demonstrates a practical and adaptable approach to produce a highly effective gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine and enables the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.</dc:description>

         <title>An Air&#8208; and Moisture&#8208;stable Zinc(II) Carbene Dithiolate Dimer Showing Fast Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Dexter Energy Transfer Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steric protection of the Zn&#8208;Carbene bond by a bridging coordination mode of 1,2&#8208;dithiolate ligands leads to air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable complexes. Efficient TADF with high radiative rate constants at room temperature is observed from 1/3LL/LMCT states according to variable temperature, transient absorption and DFT/MRCI studies. Application in Dexter energy transfer catalysis is demonstrated, exemplifying the potential of this new class of abundant 3d photoactive systems.







Abstract
A dimeric ZnII carbene complex featuring bridging and chelating benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiolate ligands is highly stable towards air and water. The donor&#8208;Zn&#8208;acceptor structure leads to visible light emission in the solid state, solution and polymer matrices with &#955;max between 577&#8211;657&#8197;nm and, for zinc(II) complexes, unusually high radiative rate constants for triplet exciton decay of up to kr=1.5&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 at room temperature. Variable temperature and DFT/MRCI studies show that a small energy gap between the 1/3LL/LMCT states of only 79&#8197;meV is responsible for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Time&#8208;resolved luminescence and transient absorption studies confirm the occurrence of long&#8208;lived, dominantly ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states in solution, allowing for application in Dexter energy transfer photocatalysis.

         <title>Diquat Based Dyes: A New Class of Photoredox Catalysts and Their Use in Aerobic Thiocyanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From diquat to dye&#8208;cat: More than just a herbicide, the reversibly reducible diquat moiety now harnesses the power of the sun. Incorporated into donor&#8211;acceptor dyes we developed, as well as into charge&#8211;transfer complexes we observed, diquat is enabled to absorb visible light. This allowed the use of these systems in the photocatalytic thiocyanation of various indoles and pyrroles, with air as the oxidant. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Wilhelm and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203541).

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete, Homochiral FeII2L3 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What does it take to make Homochiral Cages by sub&#8208;component Self&#8208;Assembly? If the cage is small enough, only limited number of chiral ligands are required because of communication by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which also results in narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior.







Abstract
Coordination chemistry is a powerful method to synthesize supramolecular cages with distinct features that suit specific applications. This work demonstrates the synthesis of discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages via chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, the installation of chirality &#8211; at both the vertices and ligand backbones &#8211; allows the formation of discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages of different sizes via stereochemical control of the iron(II) centers. We observed that larger cages require multiple chiral centra (chiral ligands and vertices). In contrast, the formation of smaller cages is stereoselective with solely chiral ligands. The latter cages can also be formed from two chiral subcomponents, but only when they have matching chirality. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of these smaller FeII2L3 cages revealed several non&#8208;covalent interactions as a driving force for narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. This expected behavior was confirmed utilizing the shorter ligands in racemic form, yielding discrete, homochiral FeII2L3 cages formed in enantiomeric pairs.

         <title>Quantum Yield of DNA Strand Breaks under Photoexcitation of a Molecular Ruby</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen sensitized by the molecular ruby [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ under excitation with UV/Vis light induces DNA strand breaks. Utilization of the DNA origami technology together with atomic force microscopy enabled the quantification of the quantum yield of strand breaks to 1&#8211;4&#8201;%, revealing the promising potential of using [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ as photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) used for treating cancer relies on the generation of highly reactive oxygen species, for example, singlet oxygen 1O2, by light&#8208;induced excitation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of molecular oxygen, inducing DNA damage in close proximity of the PS. Although many precious metal complexes have been explored as PS for PDT and received clinical approval, only recently, the potential of photoactive complexes of non&#8208;noble metals as PS has been discovered. Using the DNA origami technology that can absolutely quantify DNA strand break cross sections, we assessed the potential of the luminescent transition metal complex [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) to damage DNA in an air&#8208;saturated aqueous environment upon UV/Vis illumination. The quantum yield for strand breakage, that is, the ratio of DNA strand breaks to the number of absorbed photons, was determined to 1&#8211;4&#8201;%, indicating efficient transformation of photons into DNA strand breaks by [Cr(ddpd)2]3+.

         <title>Solvato&#8208;Controlled Assembly and Structural Transformation of Emissive Poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;Based Organometallic Cages and Their Applications in Amino Acid Sensing and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvato&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly gives a water&#8208;soluble Ag8L4 cage (A) and an Ag4L2 cage (B) produced from the same sulfonate&#8208;pendant tetraphenylethene (TPE) bridged tetrakis&#8208;(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) ligand. Both cages show interesting solvent&#8208;responsive reversible structural transformations that can be tracked with fluorescence. Furthermore, cage A shows unique properties in thermochromism, thiol amino acid detecting, and subcellular imaging in aqueous media.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;induced structural transformation of supramolecular cages has drawn increasing attention because of their sensitive feature to external variations as model systems to simulate biological processes. However, combining structural transformation and useful functions has remained a difficult task. This study reports the solvato&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of two unique topologies with different emission characteristics, a water&#8208;soluble Ag8L4 cage (A) and an Ag4L2 cage (B), produced from the same sulfonate&#8208;pendant tetraphenylethene (TPE) bridged tetrakis&#8208;(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) ligand. Both cages show interesting solvent&#8208;responsive reversible structural transformation, and the change of fluorescence signals can efficiently track the process. Additionally, water&#8208;soluble cage A exhibits unique properties in thermochromism, thiol amino acid sensing, and subcellular imaging in aqueous media.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsive Hydrocarbons Designed by &#960;&#8208;Extension of Indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pgra]perylene at the 1,2,12&#8208;Positions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three &#960;&#8208;extended indenoperylene derivatives, i.&#8201;e., an indenonaphthoperylene, an indenoterrylene, and a diindenoterrylene were synthesized. The indenonaphthoperylene exhibits red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (620&#8211;850&#8197;nm), which is rare for conjugated hydrocarbons, while the indenoterrylene and diindenoterrylene exhibit NIR absorption tailing to 870 and 940&#8197;nm, respectively. The effect of &#960;&#8208;extending indenoperylenes was evaluated, which lead to the proposal of design guidelines to narrow the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap in such conjugated hydrocarbons.







Abstract
The relationship between the overall electronic structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and the arrangement of their constituent elements is of fundamental importance. Establishing rational design guidelines for conjugated hydrocarbons with narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps is useful to develop near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsive dyes and redox&#8208;active materials. This study describes the synthesis and properties of three conjugated hydrocarbons, i.&#8201;e., an indenonaphthoperylene, an indenoterrylene, and a diindenoterrylene. These molecules exhibit NIR absorption despite the absence of significant antiaromaticity and diradical character. Notably, the indenonaphthoperylene exhibits red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission in the 620&#8211;850&#8197;nm region. The indenoterrylene and the diindenoterrylene exhibit NIR absorption tailing to 870 and 940&#8197;nm, respectively. Moreover, the effect of the &#960;&#8208;extension of indenoperylene is disclosed in order to propose guidelines for achieving a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap with negligible antiaromaticity and diradical character.

This study describes the synthesis and properties of three conjugated hydrocarbons, i.&#8201;e., an indenonaphthoperylene, an indenoterrylene, and a diindenoterrylene. These molecules exhibit NIR absorption despite the absence of significant antiaromaticity and diradical character. Notably, the indenonaphthoperylene exhibits red-to-NIR emission in the 620&#8211;850&#8197;nm region. The indenoterrylene and the diindenoterrylene exhibit NIR absorption tailing to 870 and 940&#8197;nm, respectively. Moreover, the effect of the &#960;-extension of indenoperylene is disclosed in order to propose guidelines for achieving a narrow HOMO-LUMO gap with negligible antiaromaticity and diradical character.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Introducing Aliphatic Fluoropeptides: Perspectives on Folding Properties, Membrane Partition and Proteolytic Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based fluorooligomers bearing fluorinated amino acids as main components are reported. Fluorine&#8208;induced alterations on the intrinsic hydrophobicity, &#946;&#8208;strand to &#945;&#8208;helix transitions in membrane&#8208;mimicking environments and proteolytic digestion are discussed







Abstract
A de novo designed class of peptide&#8208;based fluoropolymers composed of fluorinated aliphatic amino acids as main components is reported. Structural characterization provided insights into fluorine&#8208;induced alterations on &#946;&#8208;strand to &#945;&#8208;helix transition upon an increase in SDS content and revealed the unique formation of PPII structures for trifluorinated fluoropeptides. A combination of circular dichroism, fluorescence&#8208;based leaking assays and surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy served to examine the insertion and folding processes into unilamellar vesicles. While partitioning into lipid bilayers, the degree of fluorination conducts a decrease in &#945;&#8208;helical content. Furthermore, this study comprises a report on the proteolytic stability of peptides exclusively built up by fluorinated amino acids and proved all sequences to be enzymatically degradable despite the degree of fluorination. Herein presented fluoropeptides as well as the distinctive properties of these artificial and polyfluorinated foldamers with enzyme&#8208;degradable features will play a crucial role in the future development of fluorinated peptide&#8208;based biomaterials.

         <title>Tailoring Galactose Oxidase for Self&#8208;Powered Benzyl Alcohol Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;smart&#8221; test strip for benzylalcohol is fabricated via rationally engineering a galactose oxidase and combining a bioelectrocatalytic anode and an electrochromic Prussian blue cathode. The detection is sensitive, cost/time&#8208;efficient, and convenient.







Abstract
Benzyl alcohol (BnOH) is a widely&#8208;used preservative in a variety of cosmetics, but the excess addition (&#8805;1.0&#8201;%) may cause strong symptoms such as nausea, gastrointestinal irritation, convulsion, even death, making it crucial to monitor and control the addition quantity. Herein, we have developed a test&#8208;strip&#8208;like BnOH detection method via tailoring a galactose oxidase (GOase) towards BnOH oxidation and preparing a self&#8208;powered electrochromic strip for BnOH concentration visualization. A double&#8208;substituted GOase variant (Y329S/R330F), on the basis of the reported GOase M1, has been obtained by semi&#8208;rational design with a 24.6&#8208;fold improved activity towards BnOH compared to GOase M1. The GOase Y329S/R330F electrode has a response to BnOH with a linear range of 0.04 to 3.25&#8197;mM (R2=0.9985), a sensitivity of 122.78&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a detection limit of 0.03&#8197;mM (S/N=3). Coupling an electrochromic Prussian blue (PB) cathode helps the successful sensing visualization without any further power supply. The present sensing is more convenient and user&#8208;friendly than the generally used gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and brings a more accessible solution to the field of quality controlling.

         <title>Activatable Fluorescent Probes Targeting Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor on the Cell Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable fluorescent probes consisting of a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based fluorophore conjugated with the uPAR&#8208;binding AE105 peptide effectively monitor uPAR levels in a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; mode. The application of the fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes is demonstrated in the imaging of uPAR overexpressed on the membrane of cancer cells and in a cell&#8208;based uPAR inhibitor assay.







Abstract
Urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a glycolipid&#8208;anchored protein located on the cell surface that is implicated in the promotion of metastasis. New fluorescent probes for the detection of uPAR expression that feature a rapid &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response are reported here. They consist of a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based fluorophore conjugated with a uPAR&#8208;binding AE105 peptide. The resulting AE105&#8208;coupled uPAR&#8208;targeting probes are weakly emissive in aqueous buffer solutions; however, a fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signal is instantly triggered upon specific binding to uPAR (KD=63.2&#8197;nM for P1 and 49.5&#8197;nM for P2), which restricts the rotational deactivation of the fluorophore. Applications of the probes were demonstrated in the imaging of uPAR overexpressed on the membrane of cancer cell and in a cell&#8208;based uPAR inhibitor assay.

         <dc:description>A tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208; or tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from the Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#183;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp&#8208;lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.</dc:description>

Established Tyr- and Trp-selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys-Tyr stapling and Trp-lipidation of glucagon-like peptides in a one-pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital- and charge-controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of the Safe and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Aldehyde and Ketoamide Mpro inhibitors Derived from the Constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA Peptide Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is still wreaking havoc all over the world with surging morbidity and high mortality. The main protease (Mpro) is essential in the replication of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, enabling itself an active target for antiviral development. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a new class of peptidomimetics&#8208;constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AApeptides, based on which a series of aldehyde and ketoamide inhibitors of the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were prepared. The lead compounds showed excellent inhibitory activity in the FRET&#8208;based Mpro enzymatic assay not only for the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 but also for SARS&#8208;CoV and MERS&#8208;CoV, along with HCoVs like HCoV&#8208;OC43, HCoV&#8208;229E, HCoV&#8208;NL63 and HKU1. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic results demonstrated that our compounds form a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys145. They also demonstrated effective antiviral activity against live SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Overall, the results suggest that &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AApeptide could be a promising molecular scaffold in designing novel Mpro inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other coronaviruses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8208;H Olefination Strategy and Its Application Towards Global Proteome Profiling of &#8710;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such a strategy required innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture, and its dependence on classical alkylation/acylation strategies to install reporter tags has restricted its applications on non&#8208;covalent compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8208;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H olefination with a arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#8710;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4db, a &#8710;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with probe 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#8710;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8208;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale probing of the supramolecular assembly in a two&#8208;component gel by near&#8208;field infrared spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self&#8208;assembly. We introduce here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two&#8208;component supramolecular gel to assess the system&#180;s heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far&#8208;field IR spectroscopy, near&#8208;field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions at three distinct nano&#8208;locations of the gel network. A &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an &#945;&#8208;helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the &#946;&#8208;sheet motif is observed, with an intense &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking contribution. Near&#8208;field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non&#8208;covalent interactions, while is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides Enabled by Selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dual catalytic approach combining photocatalyst and selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid synergy has been used to cyclized of N&#8208;propargylamides. This method offers readily access to oxazole aldehydes under chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions with low catalyst loadings, where air acts as a terminal and gratuitous oxidant. The reaction is demonstrated with a range of substrates, including aryl and alkyl propargyl amides, and in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several amide&#8208;containing drug molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the acridinium catalyst is able to oxidize diselenide and generate singlet oxygen (1O2), which is responsible for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exchange Interactions and Magnetic Properties of a Molecular Mn18&#8208;Ring Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#183;xAcOH (x = 6&#8211;9) represents a rare example of a compound containing molecular Mn18&#8208;rings. These are formed by Mn3(&#181;3&#8208;O) subunits in which the high&#8208;spin Mn(III) centers are bridged by three pairs of acetate anions (AcO&#8722;). An AcOH molecule coordinates to one of the Mn atoms leading to [Mn3(&#181;3&#8208;O)(&#181;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units, designated in short as Mn3&#8208;units, that are interconnected by acetate anions via the other two Mn atoms to form Mn18&#8208;rings. Magnetic measurements show weak ferromagnetic interactions between them that are suppressed in strong magnetic field. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on Mn3 model complexes using independently DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) show a correlation between the orientation of the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller axes of pairs of Mn(III) magnetic centers and corresponding exchange coupling energies. Weak coupling between Mn3&#8208;units within the Mn18&#8208;ring allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility vs temperature dependence in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;unit within the ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxanorbornene&#8208;Fused Phenazine&#8211;Pyrene Scaffolds with Different Configurations</title>

         <dc:description>New molecular scaffolds of C&#8208;, Z&#8208; and box&#8208;shaped configurations are constructed by fusing phenazine and pyrene units with oxanorbornene. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups, and the box&#8208;shaped molecule accommodates two chloroform molecules in the cavity and forms H&#8208;bonds with another four molecules of chloroform. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped molecules as a pair of diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer between pyrene (&#960;&#8208;donor) and phenazine (&#960;&#8208;acceptor) is not dependent on the overall molecular geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactivities of Triazolium&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salts are precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which have been extensively used as effective catalysts and ligands for both asymmetric and non&#8208;enantioselective reactions. Nevertheless, they are also a kind of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that possess amphipathic properties. The unique chemical and physical properties of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts have received significant attention from scientists focusing on the development of novel bioactive molecules as pesticides and medicines. It is timely and meaningful to summarize the bioactivities of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt derivatives against various bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and other pathogens in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts was also summarized. The prospective on the future development and applications of triazolium salts as agrichemicals or human drugs have been presented here on my own opinions of the end of this concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Aromaticity of an Unusual Cyclo[18]carbon Precursor, C18Br6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the electronic structure and bonding character of the stable cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursor, C18Br6, are thoroughly characterized by molecular orbital (MO), density of states (DOS), bond order (BO), and interaction region indicator (IRI) analyses. The delocalization characters of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;electrons (labeled as &#960;out&#8208; and &#960;in&#8208;electrons, respectively) in bonding regions are examined using localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF). Then, the aromaticity is addressed via the molecular magnetic response to external magnetic field by computing the magnetically induced current density (Jind), iso&#8208;chemical shielding surface (ICSS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD), and the induced magnetic field (Bind). All these analyses indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than C18, and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208; conjugation (labeled as &#960;in&#8208;conjugation) by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>De&#8208;risking S&#8208;F bond formation:A gas cylinder&#8208;free strategy to access S(IV) and S(VI) fluorinated compounds.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;fluorine partnership occupies a privileged position in fluorine chemistry given the functional versatility that it imparts to organic structures. Despite this, available methodologies to forge S&#8211;F bonds are limited compared to C&#8211;F bond formation. Here, we describe a synthetic protocol that selectively enables the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic thiols to their corresponding SF4Cl, SO2F and SF3 derivatives. Selective oxidation of thiols to either S(IV)&#8211;F or S(VI)&#8211;F compounds is achieved by employing bench&#8208;stable calcium hypochlorite as chlorine surrogate (CLOgen), in the presence of KF as fluoride source. DFT calculations provided insight into the mechanistic aspects of the transformation and rationalized the observed isomeric preference towards the SF4Cl derivatives. Ultimately, this glovebox&#8208;free method selectively dispatches three classes of compounds upon reaction condition fine&#8208;tuning. Furthermore, first&#8208;in&#8208;class transformations are reported, including the preparation of aliphatic SF4Cl intermediates, their transformation into aliphatic sulfur pentafluoride analogs, and post&#8208;transformations that allow accessing highly complex SF4&#8208;bridged scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Parameters by Rapid Colorimetric Assessment: Evaluation of Structural Components Found in Biological Ligands and Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonding is a key molecular interaction in biological processes, drug delivery, and catalysis. This report describes a high throughput UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity using a pyrazinone sensor. This colormetric sensor reversibly binds to a hydrogen bond donor, resulting in a blue shift as additional equivalents of donor are added. Titration with excess equivalents of donor is used to determine the binding coefficient, ln(Keq). Over 100 titrations were performed for a variety of biologically relevant compounds. This data enabled development a multiple linear regression model that is capable of predicting 95% of ln(Keq) values within 1 unit, allowing for the estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement. To show the effectiveness of the single point measurements, hydrogen bond strengths were obtained for a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres. The values from the single point measurements were validated with full titrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Organic Radicals Participation in Charge Transfer: A New Strategy toward Molecular Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable organic radicals can serve as ideal building blocks for the construction of molecular functional materials due to their unique open&#8208;shell structures. In this Concept, both recent experimental progress and design strategies of stable organic radicals participating in charge transfer as open&#8208;shell donors, acceptors, and dimers to construct functional materials are discussed.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer (CT) engineering with inter&#8208;/intramolecular CT interactions by simple compositions has emerged as a universal and efficient way to construct organic functional materials. Stable organic radicals with unique physicochemical properties that cannot be realized in closed&#8208;shell molecules, have been widely demonstrated to be ideal building blocks to construct versatile organic CT materials. This concept article provides a brief overview of the advances in the design, structure and property of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT molecular functional materials, and the strategy for the generation of these materials is also highlighted. First, radicals are introduced as open&#8208;shell donors or acceptors, with a focus on their importance and uniqueness in improving electrical, magnetic and optical properties of CT functional materials. Additionally, CT interactions in stable radical dimers and trimers are further discussed systematically. Finally, the challenges are summarized and perspectives for future development of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT functional materials are provided.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Expanding Rearrangement of Benzo&#8208;Fused Tris&#8208;Cycloheptenylenes towards Nonplanar Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a benzannulated tris&#8208;tropone, a hexabrominated precursor containing three heptagons connected by a benzene ring was accessible in one step. Subsequent &#960;&#8208;extension afforded four negatively curved and overcrowded PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring&#8208;expanding 1,2&#8208;rearragement during the Suzuki couplings.







Abstract
A strongly twisted benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene, containing three dibenzosuberenone units fused to a common benzene ring, was subjected to Ramirez olefination and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acids. The high steric demand within the overcrowded, benzene&#8208;rich benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylenes enforced an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;rearrangement upon &#960;&#8208;extension during the Suzuki coupling reaction. According to crystal structure analysis, the resulting negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consist of two heptagons and one octagon surrounding a central benzene ring as a result of strain release. In the solid state, the materials exhibit a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence with increased quantum yields and a hypsochromic shift of the emission maxima compared to their respective solutions.

         <title>Reversing the Bond Length Alternation Order in Conjugated Polyenes by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond lengths are widely utilised as observable structure parameters to estimate the contributions of particular resonance structures. Herein, it is demonstrated that outstandingly strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can reverse the textbook bond&#8208;length alternation order in polyene systems. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the neutral Lewis resonance form.







Abstract
We have synthesised several push&#8208;pull substituted conjugated polyenes and determined their accurate C&#8722;C bond lengths and charge&#8208;density distributions by utilising quantum crystallographic techniques. In a series of alkene, dienes, and triene bearing two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (triflyl) groups on the terminal carbon atom, unique reversal of the bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) order has been observed. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the Lewis&#8208;structure&#8208;based neutral resonance structure. Such reversal of BLA order has not been observed in push&#8208;pull compounds bearing conventional electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and cyano groups instead of triflyl groups. Bonding behaviour of both normal and reversed bond length alternating systems has been revealed by complementary bonding analysis using several bond descriptors based on the experimentally fitted wavefunctions.

         <title>PIDA&#8208;mediated Oxidative Decarboxylation of Oxamic Acids. The Role of Radical Acidity Enhancement.</title>

         <dc:description>
An expedient thermal protocol to decarboxylate oxamic acids is found to have contrasting behaviour with its photochemical alternative. The enhanced radical acidity of a carbamoyl intermediate is shown to be key in the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative decarboxylation of oxamic acids in the presence of alcohols is shown to afford the corresponding urethanes under thermal conditions. Computational and experimental mechanistic exploration allows to rationalize the different reactivity of PIDA as compared to related cyclic BI&#8208;OAc and highlights the importance of the enhanced acidity of the proton in the carbamoyl radical intermediate.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diradical&#8208;Mediated ipso&#8208;Cyclization towards Double Dearomative [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition or Smiles&#8208;Type Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
Diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization involving dearomatizing spiro&#8208;intermediates of aromatic compounds towards divergent reaction pathways deserves investigation but has been rarely reported so far. By tuning the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage in the key dearomatizing spiro intermediate, a chemical divergent reaction of (hetero)aryl sulfonamides has been achieved in a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced energy transfer reaction pathway involving diradical species.







Abstract
When mono&#8208;radical ipso&#8208;cyclization of aryl sulfonamides tend to undergo Smiles&#8208;type rearrangement through aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;S bond cleavage, diradical&#8208;mediated cyclization must perform in a distinct reaction pathway. It is interesting meanwhile challenging to tune the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage to achieve a chemically divergent reaction of (hetero) aryl sulfonamides in a visible&#8208;light induced energy transfer (EnT) reaction pathway involving diradical species. Herein a chemically divergent reaction based on the designed indole&#8208;tethered (hetero)arylsulfonamides is reported which involves a diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization and a controllable cleavage of an inherent C&#8722;S bond. The combined experimental and computational results have revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond in these substrates can be controlled by tuning the heteroaryl moieties: a) If the (hetero)aryl is thienyl, furyl, phenanthryl, etc., the radical coupling of double dearomative diradicals (DDDR) precedes over C&#8722;S bond cleavage to afford cyclobutene fused indolines by double dearomative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition; b) if the (hetero)aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl, indolyl etc., the cleavage of C&#8722;S bond in DDDR is favored over radical coupling to afford biaryl products.

The combined experimental and computational results have revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond in these substrates can be controlled by tuning the heteroaryl moieties: a) If the (hetero)aryl is thienyl, furyl, phenanthryl, etc., the radical coupling of double dearomative diradicals (DDDR) precedes over C&#8722;S bond cleavage to afford cyclobutene fused indolines by double dearomative [2+2]-cycloaddition; b) if the (hetero)aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl, indolyl etc., the cleavage of C&#8722;S bond in DDDR is favored over radical coupling to afford biaryl products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermoresponse of Odd&#8208;Even Effect in n&#8208;Alkanethiolate Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on Gold Substrates
</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in alkanethiolate SAMs is investigated with contact&#8208;angle goniometry and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy. The thermoresponse significantly depends on the supramolecular packing feature of SAMs, and the opposite conformational change is observed for odd and even carbon numbers.







Abstract
This study examines thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n&#8208;alkanethiolates (SCn, n=3&#8211;18) formed on template&#8208;stripped gold (AuTS) using macro&#8208; and microscopic analytical techniques, contact angle goniometry (CAG) and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, respectively. Both CAG and VSFG analyses showed that the odd&#8208;even effect in liquid&#8208;like SAMs (n=3&#8211;9) disappeared upon heating at 50&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the heating led to increased structural disorder regardless of odd and even carbon numbers. In contrast, the opposite thermoresponse was observed for odd and even SCn molecules in wax&#8208; and solid&#8208;like SAMs (n=10&#8211;18). Namely, temperature&#8208;dependent orientational change of terminal CH3 relative to the surface normal was opposite for the odd and even molecules, thereby leading to mitigated odd&#8208;even effect. Our work offers important insights into thermoresponse of supramolecular structure in condensed organic matter.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization Triggered by Iminium&#8208;Enamine Activation: Access to Complex Cyclohepta[b]indoles</title>

Organocatalysis: Asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones has been developed by using organocatalytic iminium&#8208;enamine activation. The reaction provides an access to bicyclic enones with excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation to afford highly strained and complex cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres.







Abstract
The expeditious construction of complex molecules having multiple stereocentres is highly desirable in organic chemistry. In the present communication, we report the development of an organocatalytic asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones via the C3&#8208;selective Friedel&#8722;Crafts alkylation of indoles triggered by LUMO&#8208;lowering iminium activation/HOMO&#8208;raising enamine activation. The reaction provides access to bicyclic enones, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation from C2&#8208;position to afford highly strained cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres and three new C&#8722;C bonds in excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Guanidine&#8208;Functionalized Fluorescent sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Sensing and Capture of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) Ions</title>

Ultra&#8208;sensitive detection, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions by guanidine&#8208;modified fluorescent sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework is reported.







Abstract
Palladium is a key element in fuel cells, electronic industries, and organic catalysis. At the same time, chromium is essential in leather, electroplating, and metallurgical industries. However, their unpremeditated leakage into aquatic systems has caused human health and environmental apprehensions. Herein, we reported the development of an sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated fluorescent covalent organic framework with a guanidine moiety (sp2c&#8208;gCOF) that showed excellent thermal and chemical stability. The sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed effective sensing, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, which could be due to the highly accessible pore walls decorated with guanidine moieties. The fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed higher selectivity for Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.7 and 3.2&#8197;nM, respectively. The analysis of the adsorption properties with a pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model showed that sp2c&#8208;gCOF could successfully and selectively remove both Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The polymer also showed excellent capture efficacy even after seven consecutive adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Hence, this study reveals the potential of fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF for detecting, removing, and recovering valuable metals and hazardous ions from wastewater, which would be useful for economic benefit, environmental safety, human health, and sustainability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification of sp2c&#8208;COF with suitable functionalities could also be useful for sensing and extracting other water pollutants and valuable materials from an aqueous system.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation at Single or Multiple Positions to Control Sugar&#8208;Protein Connectivity in Glycoconjugate Vaccine Candidates</title>

Antigen&#8208;carrier connectivity, if controlled, can help improving immunological response to glycoconjugate vaccines. In this work, it is shown that a site&#8208;selectively triple conjugated vaccine candidate against Streptococcus pneumoniae presents a better antigenicity than its randomly conjugated counterpart.







Abstract
In cellulo site&#8208;specific unnatural amino acid incorporation based on amber stop codon reassignment is a powerful tool to modify proteins at defined positions. This technique is herein applied to the selective functionalization of the Pneumococcal surface adhesin A protein at three distinct positions. N&#1013;&#8208;propargyloxycarbonyl&#8208;l&#8208;lysine residues were incorporated and their alkyne groups reacted using click&#8208;chemistry with a synthetic azido&#8208;functionalized tetrasaccharide representative of one repeat unit of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide. Anti&#8208;PsaA antibody response induced in mice by the trivalent glycoconjugate was determined in comparison with corresponding monovalent and randomly functionalized conjugates. Our results suggest that controlled was superior to random conjugation for preserving antigenicity. In definitive, the reported strategy offers a unique opportunity to study the impact of carbohydrate antigen&#8208;carrier protein connectivity on immunogenicity.

A set of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT statistical copolymers containing hydroxyl groups attached to the P3HHT components was synthesized by KCTP polymerization. They occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on manner at 150&#8201;&#176;C, while losing the ordered packing at 300&#8201;&#176;C. The cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device&#8208;related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208;stat&#8208;poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross&#8208;linkable hydroxyl groups is synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT thin films in their as&#8208;cast state crystallize well in an edge&#8208;on orientation. During annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C, these P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high&#8208;temperature annealing at 300&#8201;&#176;C, their edge&#8208;on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross&#8208;linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state. The correlation between different P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT and their charge mobilities is scrutinized. These cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in OFETs. Conceptually, such side&#8208;chain functionalization approach to improve the stability of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT can be conveniently extended to other conjugated polymers for diverse optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis: Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cyclocondensation of (in situ Generated) Aryl Imines with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluronium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were prepared, and their ability to drive chalcogen bonds with ketones and imines was demonstrated in the solid state and in solution. These strong &#963;&#8208;hole bond donors were able to efficiently catalyze the Povarov reaction through chalcogen bond activation of imines and subsequent reaction with alkenes. The title reaction was found to be as efficient with pre&#8208;formed or in situ generated imines.







Abstract
In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron&#8208;rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium&#8208;based derivatives and their use in different applications, such as organocatalysis. In this context, the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction is presented herein. Different dienophiles, as well as imines of variable electronic nature, efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three&#8208;component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR spectroscopy. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N&#8208;phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22&#8211;38&#8197;M&#8722;1 were measured in dichloromethane.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenative Borylation of Ketones and Aldehydes with Bis(catecholato)diborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on the deoxygenative triboration/monoboration of ketones and aldehydes with B2cat2 revealed that the in&#8197;situ formed 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 rather than 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 is the key borylation intermediate. The solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide plays an important role in the isomerization from 1,1&#8208; B2cat2 to 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and promotes some intermediate processes.







Abstract
The mechanisms of direct deoxygenative borylation of acetone and benzaldehyde with bis(catecholato)diborane (B2cat2) in the solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) are investigated through detailed density functional theory calculations. These calculations show that the isomer 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 in&#8197;situ generated from 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 induced by DMA is the reactive boron intermediate for the reactions. The addition of the B&#8722;B bond of 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 to the C=O bond of acetone or benzaldehyde via a concerted [2&#963;+2&#960;]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;like transition state is the rate&#8208;limiting step for both the triboration reaction of acetone and the monoboration reaction of benzaldehyde. DMA not only acts as the solvent but also promotes the structural isomerization of B2cat2, the deoxygenation of acetone to form the vinyl boronate intermediate and subsequent diboration of vinyl boronate with 1,2&#8208;B2cat2, as well as the protodeboronation of the gem&#8208;diboronate intermediate in the deoxygenative borylation of benzaldehyde. The presented computational results can explain the observed experimental facts and provide insight into the roles of the isomeric 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and the solvent DMA in related reactions.

Lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones. Various functionalities are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).







Abstract
We demonstrate that lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones to afford stilbenes. Various functionalities (halogen, OCF3, amide, Me, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, SMe, and SPh) are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).

         <title>Supramolecular Aggregation Control in Polyoxometalates Covalently Functionalized with Oligoaromatic Groups</title>

The synthesis of Dawson type molecular metal oxides covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups is reported using a facile CLICK chemistry approach. The supramolecular chemistry of these organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids as well as their interactions with model photosensitizers are studied as basis for photoinduced electron transfer and storage systems.







Abstract
CLICK&#8208;chemistry has become a universal route to covalently link organic molecules functionalized with azides and alkynes, respectively. Here, we report how CLICK&#8208;chemistry can be used to attach oligoaromatic organic moieties to Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates. In step one, the lacunary Dawson anion [&#945;2&#8208;P2W17O61]6&#8722; is functionalized with phosphonate anchors featuring peripheral azide groups. In step two, this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid undergoes microwave&#8208;assisted CLICK coupling. We demonstrate the versatility of this route to access a series of Dawson anions covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups. The supramolecular chemistry and aggregation of these systems in solution is explored, and we report distinct changes in charge&#8208;transfer behavior depending on the size of the oligoaromatic &#960;&#8208;system.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Sensitive On&#8208;Surface Ladderization by Non&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heterocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>

On&#8208;surface non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization leads to low&#8208;temperature formation of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomer with an unprecedented high ratio of nitrogen and carbon of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4. The reaction barrier of the ladderization is sufficiently low as the small segment of the ladder units already appeared at 40&#8201;&#176;C. However, once the long linear oligomer as the intermediate is synthesized, the reaction barrier significantly increases since the orientation of the unit has to be rotated, which is the origin of the strain&#8208;sensitive on&#8208;surface ladderization.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation recently became an important reaction to planarize &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and oligomers. However, the high&#8208;activation barrier to cleave the C&#8722;H bond often requires high&#8208;temperature annealing, consequently restricting structures of precursor molecules and/or leading to random fusion at their edges. Here, we present a synthesis of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomers from 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane molecules on Ag(111) with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy. This non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization between pyrazine and ethynylene/cumulene groups has a low&#8208;activation barrier for forming intermediary dimeric oligomer containing dipyrazinopyrrolopyrrolopyrazine units, thus giving new insight into the strain&#8208;sensitive in ladder&#8208;oligomer formation.

         <title>Guided Isolation of An Uncommon Cembranoid Orthoester, Sarcotortin A, and Three Skeletal Diverse Terpenoids from the Hainan Soft Coral Sarcophyton tortuosum Based on Molecular Networking Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical study on the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum under the guidance of emerging molecular networking strategy led to the isolation and full characterization of an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8).







Abstract
Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3&#8211;6 and 9&#8211;13 were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. Compound 9 showed interesting cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA&#8208;MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

Oligofuran. A series of coplanar polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties. These novel &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s have good hole transport capacity and can function as hole&#8208;transporting layers in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is indicative of significant breakthrough in the application of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans materials in OLEDs. And our findings offer an avenue for the ingenious use of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans as p&#8208;type organic semiconductors for OLEDs.







Abstract
Tuning the photophysical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers by functionalization of skeleton, to achieve an optically and electronically advantageous building block for organic semiconductor materials is a vital yet challenging task. In this work, a series of structurally well&#8208;defined polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers for the first time. This new synthetic strategy nicely circumvents the cumbersome substituent introduction process in the later stage by the preinstallation of the desired aryl groups in the starting material. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties.

         <title>Green and Fast Strategies for Energy&#8208;Efficient Preparation of the Covalent Organic Framework TpPa&#8208;1</title>

Optimized synthesis for sustainable TpPa&#8208;1. Three strategies for organic solvent&#8208;free syntheses of covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 have been developed. Improved textural properties and yields were achieved through a modified two&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis. The water&#8208;based solvothermal synthesis with reaction times reduced more than 100&#8208;fold by microwave assistance makes it a more energy&#8208;efficient and less expensive process.







Abstract
Three synthesis procedures for the covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) TpPa&#8208;1 are studied with the purpose of setting up the most promising one in a fast and green way, leading to a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process. With conventional heating, good crystallinity and a high BET specific surface area (SSA) of up to 1007&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 are achieved at 170&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;days using water as the quintessential green solvent. However, the application of microwave radiation in the synthesis for this crystalline porous polymer allows reaction times to be shortened to 30&#8197;min while maintaining structural and textural properties (BET SSA of 928&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and obtaining yields close to 98&#8201;% (vs. 90&#8201;% in the hydrothermal synthesis). The water&#8208;assisted mechanochemical synthesis is also an environmentally friendly synthetic approach; with heating at 170&#8201;&#176;C in a two&#8208;step process (10+10&#8197;min), high crystallinity is achieved, a BET SSA of 960&#8197; m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a yield of 98&#8201;% for TpPa&#8208;1.

         <title>Enantioselective and Chemoselective Phosphine Oxide&#8208;catalyzed Aldol Reactions of N&#8208;Unprotected Cyclic Carboxyimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides has been achieved. Silicon tetrachloride acts in&#8197;situ as a protecting and mediating reagent and is converted to a nucleophilic species for the aldol reaction. The use of a chiral phosphine oxide catalyst can achieve enantioselective aldol reactions (up to 91/9 dr and 97/3 er) of various N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides, including succinimides, hydantoins and glitazones.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic transformations of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides such as succinimides, hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, and glitazones, is a powerful way of directly accessing variety of biologically valuable chiral compounds. Herein, a bis(trichlorosilyl) nucleophilic intermediate formed from cyclic carboxyimides was reacted with aldehydes via (S)&#8208;SEGPHOS dioxide (SEGPHOSO), proceeding the aldol reaction in highly enantioselective fashion through a cyclic transition state. Furthermore, N&#8208;unprotected carboxyimides were chemoselectively activated, even in the presence of N&#8208;alkylated carboxyimides, to undergo stereoselective and chemoselective aldol reactions via in&#8197;situ silicon tetrachloride activation. The functionalized cyclic carboxyimides is readily derived to the several synthetic units derivatization to various chiral building blocks without unnecessary protection/deprotection steps.

         <title>Coordination and Stabilization of a Lithium Ion with a Silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization effect: We have synthesized and characterized a silylene stabilized lithium ion 1. Compound 1 exhibits presence of two four&#8208; membered and one six&#8208; membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Compound 2 shows unusual dissociation of carbodiimide to give two four&#8208;membered rings containing a penta&#8208;coordinated silicon as a central atom. Furthermore, the bond nature and stabilization of compound 1 were confirmed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of lithium&#8208;ion as the source of lithium to use as a trans&#8208;metalation reagent [{PhC(NtBu)2Si(tBu)Li}2I(tBuN)2CPh] (1). The reaction of 3 equivalents of the LSitBu (L=PhC(NtBu)2) and lithium iodide at low temperature leads to a silylene stabilized lithium&#8208;ion with an additional coordination of amidinate ligand. Compound 1 shows two four membered and one six membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Whereas the reaction of the LSiCl with 1.5 equivalents of carbodiimide (CyN)2C at room temperature affords compound [PhC(NtBu)2Si(Cl)(NCy)2NCy] (2) with the CN2SiN2C skeleton containing silicon as a central atom. Both the compounds were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and quantum mechanical calculations.

         <title>Biomineralized Piezoelectrically Active Scaffolds for Inducing Osteogenic Differentiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bone tissue engineering scaffold was developed. The scaffold was realized by coupling porous poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) coating and calcium phosphate (CaP) coating. Piezoelectric effects can be produced by low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, the self&#8208;motion of the animal body. Through the coupling of piezoelectric effect and physicochemical properties, the scaffold has good osteoinductive ability.







Abstract
There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self&#8208;powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three&#8208;dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three&#8208;dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating. The preferred scaffold has an open circuit voltage and short circuit current output of 5&#8197;V and 200&#8197;nA. Combining the physical and chemical properties of the CaP coating, the piezoelectric signal of PVDF&#8208;HFP and the three&#8208;dimensional structure of PUF, the scaffold exhibits superior promotion of cell osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation in&#8197;vivo. The mechanism is attributed to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to chemical and piezoelectric stimulation with the material. This research not only paves the way for the application of piezoelectric scaffolds to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation in&#8197;situ, but also lays the foundation for the clinical treatment of long&#8208;term osteoporosis.

         <title>Paramagnetic Liquid Crystals With Close &#960;&#8211;&#960; Packing: The Effect of Blatter Radical Planarization on Behavior of Bent&#8208;Core Mesogens</title>

A diphenol containing 19&#8208;&#960; delocalized electrons was developed as a general intermediate to paramagnetic columnar and lamellar liquid crystals with close &#960;&#8211;&#960; contacts for electronic applications.







Abstract
A new, 19 &#960;&#8208;delocalized electrons planar Blatter radical building block was developed and used to obtain paramagnetic bent&#8208;core liquid crystals. The mesogens were investigated by optical, thermal, powder XRD and DFT methods in the pure form and as binary mixtures. Comparison of their properties with those of the classical Blatter radical analogues revealed that planarization of the central angular element results in a significantly higher stability of the mesophases and increased molecular organization suitable for the formation of ordered banana and columnar mesophases with tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results indicate access to a new, potentially rich class of functional paramagnetic soft materials.

         <title>A Conformal Carbon Nanolayer Coated Fe2O3 Cocatalyst for the Promoted Activity of Plasma&#8208;Sputtered BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>

Team work: Simultaneous improvement of activity and stability on BiVO4 photoanode was achieved by the simple H2 plasma treatment and a C&#8722;Fe2O3 oxygen evolution catalyst loading.







Abstract
To simultaneously improve the hole extraction ability of the BiVO4 photoanode and accelerate the surface reaction kinetics, herein, a carbon nanolayer conformally coated Fe2O3 (C&#8722;Fe2O3) as oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is loaded on the H2 plasma treated nanoporous BiVO4 (BVO(H2)) surface by a hydrothermal reaction. It is found that the H2 plasma induced vacancies in BVO remarkably increases the conductivity, and the C&#8722;Fe2O3 enables hole extraction from the bulk to the surface as well as efficient hole injection to the electrolyte. As a result, the C&#8722;Fe2O3/BVO(H2) photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 4.4&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an ABPE value of 1.5&#8201;% at 0.68&#8197;V vs. RHE, which are 4.8&#8208;fold and 13&#8208;fold higher than that of BVO photoanode, respectively.

A four&#8208;step approach to a presilphiperfolanol: Allylation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pulegone followed by an alkylation renders a trisubstituted cyclohexanone, which leads to a bridged bicyclo[4.3.1]undecen&#8208;one by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The embedded alkene&#8208;ketone functionalization is key for the metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) intramolecular &#8220;alkene first&#8221; radical process leading to the epimer at C&#8208;4 of presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;ol.







Abstract
From an (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;pulegone&#8208;derived building block that incorporates the stereo&#8208;defined tertiary carbon bearing a methyl group, as found in the targeted sesquiterpenoid, a four&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;4&#8208;epi&#8208;presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ol was achieved. The key processes involved are a ring&#8208;closing metathesis leading to a bridged alkene&#8208;tethered ketone and its subsequent FeIII&#8208;mediated metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) transannular cyclization. This synthetic method, implying an irreversible addition of a carbon&#8208;centered radical upon a ketone by means of a hydrogen atom transfer upon the alkoxy radical intermediate, was also applied in the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused hydrindanols structurally related to botrydial compounds.

Synthesis of overcrowded negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A hexabrominated benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene was &#960;&#8208;extended by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling to afford PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring&#8208;expanding 1,2&#8208;rearragement. This is due to the high steric demand. The title compounds display a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence and increased emission intensity as well as hypsochromic shifts in the solid state. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. M&#252;llen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203735).

A hexabrominated benzo-fused tris-cycloheptenylene was &#960;-extended by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling to afford PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring-expanding 1,2-rearragement. This is due to the high steric demand. The title compounds display a blue to blue-green fluorescence and increased emission intensity as well as hypsochromic shifts in the solid state.

         <title>Frontispiece: Stable Organic Radicals Participation in Charge Transfer: A New Strategy toward Molecular Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable organic radicals can serve as ideal building blocks for the construction of molecular functional materials due to their unique open&#8208;shell structures. In this Concept, both recent experimental progress and design strategies of stable organic radicals participating in charge transfer as open&#8208;shell donors, acceptors, and dimers to construct functional materials are discussed.

Isocyanides, thanks to their multiple reactivities, are the main players in multicomponent reactions. While traditional approaches exploit their two&#8208;electrons reactivity, they are currently &#8220;on stage&#8221;, shining in a new light thanks to the development of visible light photochemical reaction conditions. For more information, see the Review by Gian Cesare Tron and Mariateresa Giustiniano et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203150).

Nontoxic and energy&#8208;efficient COF synthesis: Covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 has been successfully obtained in a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis, replacing the traditional organic&#8208;based solvent with water and reducing reaction times from several days to 30&#8197;minutes. High&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis resulted in higher BET specific surface areas (compared to traditional solvothermal processes), improved material yields, and excellent textural properties.

Isocyanide&#8208;based Multicomponent Reactions in a new light! A review about challenges, potentialities, new trends, and future directions of exploiting isocyanide unique reactivity features under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions claim a one century&#8208;old history of flourishing developments. On the other hand, the enormous impact of recent progresses in visible light photocatalysis has boosted the identification of new straightforward and green approaches to both new and known chemical entities. In this context, the application of visible light photocatalytic conditions to multicomponent processes has been promoting key stimulating advancements. Spanning from radical&#8208;polar crossover pathways, to photoinduced and self&#8208;catalyzed transformations, to reactions involving the generation of imidoyl radical species, the present literature analysis would provide a general and critical overview about the potentialities and challenges of exploiting isocyanides in visible light photocatalytic multicomponent reactions.

         <title>Advances in Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Alkynes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 15, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a potential candidate to traditional thermocatalytic process. Alkynes adsorption, hydrogenation and alkenes desorption intrinsically determine the activity and alkene selectivity. In this review, the advances in electrocatalysts and electrolyzers for selective hydrogenation of alkynes are focused.







Abstract
Selective electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive and high&#8208;cost thermocatalytic hydrogenation. However, the systematic summary on the electrocatalysts and electrolyzers remains lacked. Herein, we demonstrate a comprehensive review about recent achievements in the electrocatalysts including noble metal and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal materials. Several effective strategies of catalyst design were developed to improve alkyne conversion, and alkene selectivity, for example, accelerating the formation of active hydrogen species, enhancing alkyne adsorption and suppressing the side reactions. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of various electrolyzers are systematically discussed. Accordingly, major challenges and future trends in this field are proposed.

Several effective strategies of catalyst design were developed to improve alkyne conversion, and alkene selectivity, for example, accelerating the formation of active hydrogen species, enhancing alkyne adsorption and suppressing the side reactions. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of various electrolyzers are systematically discussed. Accordingly, major challenges and future trends in this field are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Binders Compatible with Ionic Liquid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suitability of aqueous binders for aluminum ion batteries (AIBs), especially the compatibility with ionic liquids and the distribution on the cathode surface, is systematically investigated. Typically, AIBs with sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) as binder exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability.







Abstract
The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8722;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation Relay (CHAR) of Proline Ester Derivatives Promoted by In Situ Triarylamine Radical Cation: Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Bromopyrrole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR) of proline esters was realized by the in&#8197;situ generated tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)amine radical cation, selectively constructing the skeleton of 4&#8208;bromopyrrole under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Using the in&#8197;situ generated triarylamine radical cation as an initiator, the sp3 C&#8722;H bond of proline esters was smoothly oxidized and brominated through C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR), giving a series of 4&#8208;bromopyrroles in good yields with high regioselectivity. The mechanistic study revealed that the oxidation of the active C&#8722;H bond initiated the followed 1,5&#8208;HAT and bromination, which provides a new method to realize the functionalization of the remote C&#8722;H bond.

         <title>The Aldol&#8208;Tishchenko Reaction of Butanone, Cyclobutanone and a 3&#8208;Pentanone Derived Sulfinylimine and DFT Calculations of the Stereo&#8208;determining Step</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantio&#8208; and diastereoenriched 1,3&#8208;aminoalcohols are a highly versatile class of molecules in organic synthesis. However, most of the current syntheses involve a multi&#8208;step approach and the stepwise introduction of the chiral centres. Herein, we describe a one&#8208;step, highly diastereoselective method to furnish derivatives of these compounds via a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of cyclic and acyclic chiral sulfinylimines.







Abstract
Herein, we present a highly diastereoselective method to furnish acyclic 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diol derivatives using a tandem double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko protocol (dr up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1) using a butanone derived sulfinylimine. In most cases only 1 diastereomer predominates, from a possible 16. The reaction is also regioselective. In addition, the highly challenging cyclobutanone and 3&#8208;pentanone derivatives are also amenable to a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction, although the dr values are modest. Despite that, clean single diastereomers can be isolated, which should prove very useful in medicinal chemistry and other areas. Detailed DFT calculations support the observed stereoselectivities in all cases, providing a rationale for the excellent dr values in the butanone series and the moderate values for the 3&#8208;pentanone class.

         <title>Tris(boranil) Columnar Liquid Crystalline Fluorophores: pseudo&#8208;Triphenylene Boron(III) Complexes with Peripheral N&#8722;B&#8722;O Linkages</title>

Photoluminescent tris(boranil) discotics derived from tris&#8208;anils exhibit room temperature columnar mesomorphism, and redox behavior.







Abstract
The borate complexes derived from salicylaldimine ligands, called boranils, possess a wide range of photophysical and electronic characteristics intrinsically. The unique combination of molecular rigidity, rendered by four&#8208;coordinate boron bridges, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation enable them to serve as technically feasible fluorescent materials (dyes). The incorporation of liquid crystallinity in these boron(III) complexes, especially the columnar (Col) mesomorphism, which is overlooked hitherto, would provide a new dimension to these complexes. Herein, we report the first examples of tris(boranil) discotic liquid crystal (LC) dyes that have been readily synthesized by treating tris(N&#8208;salicylideneaniline)s, (TSAN)s, with BF3.Et2O in the presence of an acid quencher. These C3&#8208;symmetric borate complexes self&#8208;assemble into the Col phase, existing over a wide thermal span including room temperature. The 2D periodic order of the Col phases shows dependence on the length of the peripheral tails. The photophysical measurements reveal the fluorescence emission in their two condensed states viz., solid and Col phase, and in solution. Their electrochemical, two&#8208;step oxidation process coupled with the aforesaid features upholds their significance in applied research.

         <title>Distinct Reactivity of Trimethylytterbium toward AlMe3 and GaMe3: Synthesis of Donor&#8208;Stabilized Dimethylytterbium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;stabilized dimethylytterbium: Readily available donor&#8208;stabilized trimethylytterbium reacts with AlMe3 under reduction via a methyl radical pathway to divalent bis(tetramethylaluminato) ytterbium. Contrary to this, addition of GaMe3 affords trivalent adduct [(Me3TACN)YbMe2(&#956;&#8208;Me)GaMe3], which reacts with KC8 in THF to the first donor&#8208;stabilized dimethylytterbium complex.







Abstract
Me3TACN (1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane)&#8208;stabilized trimethylytterbium was obtained via a salt&#8208;metathesis protocol employing [(Me3TACN)YbCl3] and methyllithium. Complex [(Me3TACN)YbMe3] seems not to engage in redox chemistry with potassium graphite and is thermally quite stable in the solid state. Treatment of trivalent [(Me3TACN)YbMe3] with 3&#8197;equiv. of AlMe3 afforded divalent tetramethylaluminate complex [(Me3TACN)Yb(AlMe4)2]. The reaction of [(Me3TACN)YbMe3] with GaMe3 in THF gave trivalent ion pair [(Me3TACN)YbMe2(thf)][GaMe4], which is susceptible to reduction with KC8. The thermally very labile divalent [(Me3TACN)YbMe(&#956;&#8208;Me)]2 is the first discrete donor adduct of a divalent dimethyl rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complex.

         <title>Induced CPL&#8208;Active Materials Based on Chiral Supramolecular Co&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular assembly processes can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. This review summarizes the related advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral co&#8208;assembly system, their research status and application prospects in CP&#8208;EL field, and current challenges.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. As known, dissymmetry factor (gem) of CPL is one essential factor for evaluating the features of CPL&#8208;active materials. Much attention has focused on how to increase the gem value, which is one of the most important issues for CPL practical applications. Recently, more and more works have demonstrated that chiral supramolecular could provide the significant strategy to improve the gem value through the orderly helical superstructure of chiral building blocks. Normally, this kind of chiral supramolecular assembly process can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. In this review, we fully summarized recent advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies, their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and current challenges.

         <title>Mesoporous CuFe2O4 Photoanodes for Solar Water Oxidation: Impact of Surface Morphology on the Photoelectrochemical Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic comparison of distinct surface morphologies of sol&#8208;gel&#8208;derived CuFe2O4 for solar water splitting shows that high&#8208;surface&#8208;area photoelectrodes are preferred for driving thermodynamically favorable reactions, such as sulfite oxidation, while lower surface area photoabsorbers are beneficial for driving thermodynamically uphill processes like the water oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Metal oxide&#8208;based photoelectrodes for solar water splitting often utilize nanostructures to increase the solid&#8208;liquid interface area. This reduces charge transport distances and increases the photocurrent for materials with short minority charge carrier diffusion lengths. While the merits of nanostructuring are well established, the effect of surface order on the photocurrent and carrier recombination has not yet received much attention in the literature. To evaluate the impact of pore ordering on the photoelectrochemical properties, mesoporous CuFe2O4 (CFO) thin film photoanodes were prepared by dip&#8208;coating and soft&#8208;templating. Here, the pore order and geometry can be controlled by addition of copolymer surfactants poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(propylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (Pluronic&#174; F&#8208;127), polyisobutylene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (PIB&#8208;PEO) and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (Kraton liquid&#8482;&#8208;PEO, KLE). The non&#8208;ordered CFO showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.2&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE for sulfite oxidation, but the least photocurrent density for water oxidation. Conversely, the ordered CFO presented the best photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. These differences can be understood on the basis of the high surface area, which promotes hole transfer to sulfite (a fast hole acceptor), but retards oxidation of water (a slow hole acceptor) due to electron&#8208;hole recombination at the defective surface. This interpretation is confirmed by intensity&#8208;modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and vibrating Kelvin probe surface photovoltage spectroscopy (VKP&#8208;SPS). The lowest surface recombination rate was observed for the ordered KLE&#8208;based mesoporous CFO, which retains spherical pore shapes at the surface resulting in fewer surface defects. Overall, this work shows that the photoelectrochemical energy conversion efficiency of copper ferrite thin films is not just controlled by the surface area, but also by surface order.

         <title>Traceless N&#8208;Polyfluoroalkylation of Weakly Nucleophilic Nitrogen Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report an efficient access to high&#8208;value N&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and N,N&#8209;bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via N&#8209;polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). The in situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8209;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8209;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.</dc:description>

The in situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8209;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N-sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N-(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8209;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidation State Tuning of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Phenothiazine and Phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic dimers consisting of combinations of butterfly&#8208;shaped phenothiazine (PTZ) and its chemically oxidized form phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (PTZSO2) have been synthesized. A twist is imposed across the dimers by ortho&#8208;substituents including methyl ethers, sulfides and sulfones. X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy, underpinned by computational studies, have been employed to study the interplay between the oxidation state, conformational restriction, and emission mechanisms including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). While the PTZSO2 dimers are simple fluorophores, the presence of PTZ induces triplet&#8208;mediated emission with a mixed PTZ&#8208;PTZSO2 dimer displaying concentration dependent hallmarks of both TADF and RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural complexity in the apparently simple crystal structure of Be2Ru</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural features of the hexagonal layered crystal structure of Be2Ru (a = 5.7508(3) &#197;, c = 3.0044(2) &#197;, space group P &#8208;62m) were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The residual electron density and high&#8208;resolution TEM images show that the real structure can be described as an intergrowth of the main hexagonal matrix of the Fe2P type with minor orthorhombic inclusions of its stacking variants. Such atomic arrangement is stabilized by the charge transfer from Be to Ru and by a system of polar three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic bonds involving both components. The calculated electronic density of states (DOS) of Be2Ru revealed, contrarily to typical intermetallic compounds, a pseudo gap (dip) in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of Be2Ru shows metal behavior in agreement with the non&#8208;zero DOS at the Fermi level.</dc:description>

         <title>HAV&#8208;peptides attached to colloidal probes faithfully detect E&#8208;cadherins displayed on living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell adhesion molecules are crucial for a variety of biological&#160;processes, including wound healing, barrier formationand tissue homeostasis. One of them is E&#8208;cadherin&#160;which is generally found at adherent junctions between epithelialcells. To identify this molecule on the surface of&#160;cells, E&#8208;cadherin mimetic peptides with a critical aminoacid sequence of HAV (histidine&#8208;alanine&#8208;valine) were synthesized&#160;and attached to solid supported membranes coveringcolloidal probes. Two different functionalization strategies&#160;were established, one based on complexation of DOGSNTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine&#8208;tagged HAV&#8208;peptide and the&#160;other one relying on the formation of a HAV&#8208;lipopeptide usingin situ maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. Binding studies were&#160;performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attachto the membrane surface. Compared to the non&#8208;covalent&#160;attachment via the His&#8208;tag, we achieved a higher yield bylipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with&#160;HAV&#8208;peptides were employed to measure the presence of Ecadherinson living cells either using video particle tracking&#160;or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examinedconfirming the specific interaction of the HAV&#8208;peptide&#160;with the E&#8208;cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods werealso used to determine the number of single&#8208;bond ruptures&#160;and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essentialfor the development of novel biosynthetic materials&#160;given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medicalapplications.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse Roles of ScSERF in Modifying the Fibril Growth of Amyloidogenic Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is often related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases including fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Recently, the SERF protein family has been reported to have a significant regulatory effect on amyloid formation, but it is still unclear about the detailed mechanisms SERF acted on different amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy to explore interactions of ScSERF with three amyloidogenic proteins FUS&#8208;LC, FUS&#8208;Core, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. NMR chemical shift perturbations reveal they share similar interaction sites on the N&#8208;terminal region of ScSERF. However, the amyloid formation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein protein is accelerated by ScSERF, while the fibrosis of FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC protein is inhibited by ScSERF. Both the primary nucleation and the total amount of fibrils produced are detained. Our results suggest a diverse role of ScSERF in regulating the fibril growth of amyloidogenic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin in organic cocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic spintronics has caused a huge revolution in creating highly&#8208;efficient low&#8208;power circuits. Spin manipulation in organic cocrystals has become a promising strategy to uncover more chemicophysical properties for diverse applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements of spin properties in organic charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals, and briefly describe the possible mechanisms behind them. Beside the known spin properties (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) in binary/ternary cocrystals, other spin phenomena in radical cocrystals and spin transport are also summarized and discussed. Hopefully, deep understanding of current achievements, challenges and perspectives will offer the clear direction for the introduction of spin in organic cocrystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 3,4&#8208;epoxy amides and esters with aromatic amines as nucleophiles. This method features high regiocontrol, diastereospecific SN2 reaction pathway, broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions, furnishing a wide range of &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives in a highly enantioselective manner. Notably, the selective nucleophilic attack to the C&#8208;4 position of epoxides is controlled by the directing effect of the pendant carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed with high affinity and selectivity. The receptor was efficiently synthesized in three steps through dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The receptor features two parallel durene panels, forming a hydrophobic pocket for [CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960;] interactions, and two pyridinium residues directing four amide bonds towards the pocket. These pyridinium residues not only improve solubility but also provide polarized C&#8208;H bonds for hydrogen bonding. Experimental data and DFT calculations show that these polarized C&#8208;H bonds significantly enhance substrate binding. These findings demonstrate the power of dynamic covalent chemistry for creating molecular receptors and using polarized C&#8208;H bonds for boosted carbohydrate recognition in water, providing a foundation for developing glucose&#8208; responsive materials and sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Four&#8208;Step Synthesis of the Potato Alkaloid Demissidine from the Common Sapogenin Tigogenin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;step synthesis of demissidine from tigogenin acetate was developed. The key&#8208;step of the synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate.







Abstract
A simple synthesis method of solanidane alkaloids from common steroidal sapogenins was developed. Previously described multi&#8208;step transformations of tigogenin to demissidine (8&#8211;12&#8197;steps) were shortened to four steps only. The key&#8208;step of the present synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate. Different approaches to this reaction, i.&#8201;e., a classical one via enolate, and a chemoselective umpolung transformation, were thoroughly investigated. The epimerization step is unnecessary if the starting sapogenin has the same configuration at C25 as the target alkaloid because the configuration at C25 (either R or S) remains intact throughout the synthesis. Thus, the related solanidane alkaloids, 12&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;25&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine and 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine, were synthesized in the three&#8208;step procedure with retention of configuration at this stereogenic center from rockogenin (25R&#8208;5&#945;&#8208;sapogenin) or sarsasapogenin (25S&#8208;5&#946;&#8208;sapogenin), respectively.

         <title>The Biologically Inspired Abilities of Metallosupramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent efforts to use metallosupramolecular structures to mimic biologically inspired functions including molecular recognition and catalysis are described.







Abstract
Natural machinery such as proteins and enzymes can bind substrates and perform intricate functions on these molecules. This behaviour is mediated by highly ordered but conformationally flexible structures dictated through favourable intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions. Metallosupramolecular architectures (MSAs) function as synthetic machinery that are responsive to their environment, and display similar, but less impressive, abilities to their biological counterparts. Natural and synthetic systems share the properties of molecular recognition and catalysis facilitated through the often complex structures of these architectures. This article outlines efforts to use metallosupramolecular structures to mimic the properties of biological enzymes and machines using important recent examples from the field.

         <title>Preparation, Structure&#8208;Performance Relationship, and Reaction Network of ZnZSM&#8208;5 for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indirect oxidative dehydrogenation: Introduction of appropriate amount of Zn onto ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite resulted in highly dispersed and active site for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH), structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were systematically investigated.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) is a major chemical for the modern society, and new technologies for its production are of strategic importance globally. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C2H4 production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attention. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM&#8208;5 supported Zn system, i.&#8201;e., ZnZSM&#8208;5, which showed great promise in CO2&#8208;ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM&#8208;5 at 700&#8201;&#176;C and a CO2:C2H6 feeding ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1. During 340&#8197;min TOS, the C2H6 conversion decreased moderately from 36.2&#8201;% to 23.1&#8201;%, and the C2H4 yield stabilized at 21.9&#8201;% to 27.9&#8201;%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.

         <title>Quest for a Rational Molecular Design of Alkyl&#8208;Distyrylbenzene Liquid by Substitution Pattern Modulation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via modulation of the substitution pattern, 2&#8208;decyltetradecyl chains at the 2,5&#8208;substituted position was found to be the desired substitution pattern for alkyl&#8208;distyrylbenzene liquids exhibiting the lowest viscosity as a practically stable liquid at room temperature, intrinsic optical properties, as well as high thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stabilities. The guiding strategy will be useful for constructing superior alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with rich optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Alkyl&#8208;&#960; functional molecular liquids (FMLs) are of interest for fabricating soft electronic devices due to their fluidic nature and innate optoelectronic functions from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety. However, predictable development of alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the desired liquid and optoelectronic properties is challenging. A series of alkyl&#8208;distyrylbenzene (DSB) liquids was studied in terms of the substituent position effect by attaching 2&#8208;octyldodecyl chains at (2,4&#8208;), (2,5&#8208;), (2,6&#8208;), and (3,5&#8208;). The effect of the alkyl chain length was investigated by attaching 2&#8208;hexyldecyl, 2&#8208;decyltetradecyl (C10C14), and 2&#8208;dodecylhexadecyl at the (2,5&#8208;) substituent position. The 2,5&#8208;C10C14 substituent pattern constructed a superior alkyl&#8208;DSB liquid with a lower viscosity, intrinsic optical properties, and high thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stabilities. The discovered 2,5&#8208;C10C14 was applied to dicyanostyrylbenzene and comparable liquid physical and optical superiorities were confirmed. This molecular design is useful for creating alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the aforementioned advantages, which are applicable for deformable and flowable optoelectronic devices.

The discovered 2,5-C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; was applied to dicyanostyrylbenzene and comparable liquid physical and optical superiorities were confirmed. This molecular design is useful for creating alkyl-&#960; FMLs with the aforementioned advantages, which are applicable for deformable and flowable optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Controlling aspects of the &#956;2&#8208;X&#8722; bridging anion in the metal&#8211;organic framework Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 [GaX(bdc)] (X&#8722;=(OH)&#8722; or F&#8722;, bdc=1, 4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) is shown to direct the temperature at which thermally induced breathing transitions of this framework occur. In situ single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that substituting 20&#8201;% of (OH)&#8722; in [Ga(OH)(bdc)] (1) for F&#8722; to produce [Ga(OH)0.8F0.2(bdc)] (2) stabilises the large pore (lp) form relative to the narrow pore (np) form, causing a well&#8208;defined decrease in the onset of the lp to np transition at higher temperatures, and the adsorption/desorption of nitrogen at lower temperatures through np to lp to intermediate (int) pore transitions. These in&#8197;situ diffraction studies have also yielded a more plausible crystal structure of the int&#8208;[GaX(bdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O phases and shown that increasing the heating rate to a flash heating regime can enable the int&#8208;[GaX(bdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O to lp&#8208;[GaX(bdc)] transition to occur at a lower temperature than np&#8208;[GaX(bdc)] via an unreported pathway.

         <title>Cyclic or Linear? Parameters Determining the Outcome of Glycine Polymerization in Silica Surface Prebiotic Scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic or linear? The parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization on silica surface are studied through monomers deposition from both gas and liquid phases. The results showed that the density of the nearly&#8208;free silanols NFS is a crucial parameter to predict the formation of linear or cyclic polymers when Gly is deposited from gas phase. For liquid phase deposition, Gly deposited in its zwitterionic form could isomerize to its neutral form and readsorb on the silanol&#8208;Gly esters to form linear peptides besides DKP.Please consider the following revised version of TOC







Abstract
The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density&#8804;0.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5&#8197;nm&#8722;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.

Coordination polymers: The combination of the rigid, aromatic dinitrile isomers ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4, the pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR=Cp*, Cp&#8217;&#8217;; Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3) with different steric demands and a silver salt with a non&#8208;coordinating anion SbF6&#8722; gives a unique view into how those building blocks can influence a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly system giving rise to various 1D/2D/3D&#8208;coordination polymers.







Abstract
Pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) (A), Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3 (B)) are excellent building blocks for polymeric assemblies in supramolecular chemistry in combination with coinage metal salts of weakly coordinating anions such as AgSbF6. Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4 in a one&#8208;pot reaction between [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and AgSbF6 leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)2C6H4 play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs. All CPs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>AAZTA&#8208;Like Ligands Bearing Phenolate Arms as Efficient Chelators for 68Ga Labelling in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AAZTA&#8208; and DATA&#8208;like ligands bearing one phenolate pendant arm form Ga(III) complexes with significant thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. 68Ga labelling was efficient both at room temperature and at 95&#8201;&#176;C and an &#945;v&#946;3 integrin targeting probe was synthesized, labelled, and tested in&#8197;vivo on B16&#8208;F10 tumours.







Abstract
The introduction of a phenolate pendant arm in place of an acetate on AAZTA&#8208; and DATA&#8208;like ligands resulted in hepta&#8208; and hexadentate chelators able to form Ga(III) complexes with thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness higher than that of other Ga(III) complexes based on the parent 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine scaffold. In particular, the heptadentate AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB with a phenolate arm on an endocyclic N&#8208;atom shows a logKGaL of 27.35 and a remarkable resistance to hydroxide coordination up to basic pH (pH&gt;9). This behaviour allows to also improve the kinetic inertness of the complex showing a dissociation half&#8208;life (t1/2) at pH&#8197;7.4 of 76&#8197;h. Although also the hexadentate AAZ2A&#8208;exoHB chelator forms a stable (logKGaL=24.69) and inert (t1/2=33&#8197;h at pH&#8197;7.4) Ga(III) complex, the 68Ga labelling showed a better radiochemical yield with AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB, especially at room temperature. Thus, a bifunctional chelator of AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB was synthesized bearing an isothiocyanate group that was conjugated to the N&#8208;terminus of a c(RGD) peptide for integrin receptor targeting. Finally, the conjugate was successfully labelled with 68Ga isotope, and the resulting radiotracer tested for its stability in human serum and then in&#8197;vivo for targeting B16&#8208;F10 tumours with miniPET imaging.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AAZTA- and DATA-like ligands&lt;/b&gt; bearing one phenolate pendant arm form Ga(III) complexes with significant thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga labelling was efficient both at room temperature and at 95&#8201;&#176;C and an &#945;&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&#946;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; integrin targeting probe was synthesized, labelled, and tested in&#8197;vivo on B16-F10 tumours.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a phenolate pendant arm in place of an acetate on AAZTA- and DATA-like ligands resulted in hepta- and hexadentate chelators able to form Ga(III) complexes with thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness higher than that of other Ga(III) complexes based on the parent 6-amino-6-methylperhydro-1,4-diazepine scaffold. In particular, the heptadentate AAZ3A-endoHB with a phenolate arm on an endocyclic N-atom shows a log&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;GaL&lt;/sub&gt; of 27.35 and a remarkable resistance to hydroxide coordination up to basic pH (pH&amp;gt;9). This behaviour allows to also improve the kinetic inertness of the complex showing a dissociation half-life (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) at pH&#8197;7.4 of 76&#8197;h. Although also the hexadentate AAZ2A-exoHB chelator forms a stable (log&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;GaL&lt;/sub&gt;=24.69) and inert (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=33&#8197;h at pH&#8197;7.4) Ga(III) complex, the &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga labelling showed a better radiochemical yield with AAZ3A-endoHB, especially at room temperature. Thus, a bifunctional chelator of AAZ3A-endoHB was synthesized bearing an isothiocyanate group that was conjugated to the N-terminus of a c(RGD) peptide for integrin receptor targeting.

         <title>Novel Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes with Bulky Charge&#8208;Carrier Groups as Dopants for Highly Efficient Green Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane, namely (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac, were fully synthesized and characterized. Both of the targeted iridium complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Compared to (TPAPr)2IrAcac, (TPSPr)2IrAcac achieved its highest PLQY and current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration probably because of its bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can effectively suppress the concentration quenching. However, according to DFT studies, (TPSPr)2IrAcac shows faster non&#8208;radiative transitions due to the presence of more excited&#8208;state distortions than (TPAPr)2IrAcac. As a result, Green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) containing (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants exhibit exceptional device performance with peak CE values of 38.24 cd A&#8208;1 and 36.06 cd A&#8208;1, respectively. (TPAPr)2IrAcac exhibited a superior efficiency than (TPSPr)2IrAcac because of its high &#1060;p, low RMSD value, and efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest. More importantly, the PLEDs based on (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac show stable phosphorescent emission with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.313, 0.497) and (0.299, 0.483), respectively. This work points out a viable method for creating phosphorescent iridium complexes based on pyrimidine for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Bi bimetallic nanochains for&#160;electroredution of CO2&#160;to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H2 ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium&#8208;bismuth (Pd&#8211;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1:7 to 9:1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios, and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3 mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of &#8208;2.3 V vs Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1:1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of &#8208;2.0 V vs Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites, and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1:7 to 9:1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios, and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3 mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of -2.3 V vs Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1:1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of -2.0 V vs Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid-based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites, and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host&#8208;derived lipids such as cholesterol support Mtb&#160;growth, and are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb&#160;cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb&#160;cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure&#8208;guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in&#8208;cell activity against clinically relevant drug&#8208;resistant isolates were obtained. These will support further development of much&#8208;needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb&#160;pathogenesis.</dc:description>

Host-derived lipids such as cholesterol support Mtb&#160;growth, and are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb&#160;cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb&#160;cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure-guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in-cell activity against clinically relevant drug-resistant isolates were obtained. These will support further development of much-needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb&#160;pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward synthesis approach to chiral 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminoethanols via the one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation catalyzed by Ir catalyst was developed. This tandem process involves the in situ generation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the nucleophilic substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromoketones with amines and the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketone intermediates to provide diverse enantiomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. The excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 96% yield and up to &gt;99% ee) with a wide substrate scope in this one&#8208;pot strategy were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Triboelectric nanogenerators assembled by cobalt(II) coordination polymer incorporated composite films and their application for self&#8208;powered anticorrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A friction layer with stability and durability is important to promote the practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional cobalt coordination polymer (Co&#8208;CP) was successfully synthesized using cobalt nitrate, 4, 4', 4''&#8208;tricarboxyltriphenylamine and 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine. To clarify the effect of the doping proportions of Co&#8208;CP and the types of conposite polymers on the output performance of the TENG,&#160;Co&#8208;CP was combined with two organic polymers having different polarities (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and ethyl cellulose (EC)) to form a series of composite films, which were used as the friction electrode materials to fabricate TENGs. Electrical characterizations indicated that a high output current and voltage were obtained from the TENG based on 15 wt% Co&#8208;CP incorporated in PVDF (Co&#8208;CP@PVDF), which could be further improved by the Co&#8208;CP@EC composite film at the same doping ratio. Furthermore, the optimally fabricated TENG was demonstrated to prevent electrochemical corrosion of carbon steel.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis and Characterization of Indenone Azine&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Accepting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indenone azines, in which the exocyclic C=C bond in dibenzopentafulvalene is replaced by an azine moiety (C=N&#8211;N=C), were synthesized as novel electron&#8208;accepting p&#8208;conjugated scaffolds. Structural modulation at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions of indenone azines enabled stereoselective syntheses of diastereomers in which the configurations of the two C=N bonds are (E,E) or (Z,Z). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that all the indenone azines exhibit high coplanarity in contrast to the twisted frameworks of dibenzopentafulvalene derivatives, resulting in the formation of densely &#960;&#8208;stacked structures. Electrochemical measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed the electron&#8208;accepting character of indenone azines comparable to isoindigo dyes. In particular, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives impart enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and significantly red&#8208;shifted photoabsorption. This study demonstrates that indenone azines represent a promising candidate as an electron&#8208;accepting building block for optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A BF2 Chelate Exhibiting Excimer&#8208;like Fluorescence with an Unusually Large Stokes Shift in the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The target mono&#8208;BF2 complex is weakly emissive in fluid solution because radiationless decay of the excited&#8208;singlet state is promoted through an intramolecular N&#8230;H&#8211;N hydrogen bond. The lack of mirror symmetry for this compound is attributed to vibronic effects, as reported previously for the bis&#8208;BF2 complex (BOPHY). Red&#8208;shifted fluorescence is observed from single crystals, the emission quantum yield approaching 30% with a fluorescence lifetime of 2 ns. The large Stokes shift of 5,700 cm&#8208;1 helps minimize self&#8208;absorption. Crystallography indicates that the internal fold and twist angles are increased substantially in the crystal, but the hydrogen bond is weakened relative to solution. The crystal structure is compiled from pairs of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail molecules having a shift of ca. 4.1 &#197; and closest approach of ca. 3.5 &#197;. These molecular pairs are arranged in columns, which, in turn, assemble into sheets. The proximity favours excitonic coupling between individual molecules, with the coupling strength obtained by analysis of the absorption spectrum reaching ca. 1,000 cm&#8208;1. Both the ideal dipole approximation and the extended dipole methodology seriously overestimate the coupling strength, but the atomic transition charge density procedure leads to good agreement with experiment. Emission is attributed to the closely coupled molecular pair functioning in an excimer&#8208;like manner with the exciton trapped in a local minimum. Increasing temperature causes a slight blue shift and loss of fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first 8&#8208;electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp = S2P(O i Pr)2&#8208;) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55% yield. Further modification of the shell results in the formation of [PdAg21(dtp)12]+3 via an internal redox reaction, with the system retaining an 8&#8208;electron superatomic configuration. The interstitial hydride in 1 and 2, contributes its 1s1 electron to the superatomic electron count, and occupies a PdAg3 tetrahedron. The distributions of isomers corresponding to different dispositions of the outer capping Ag atoms are investigated by multinuclear VT&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The emissive state of 3 has a lifetime of 200 &#956;s (&#955;ex =448; &#955;em =842), while 1 and 2 are non&#8208;emissive.

Abstract
The photophysical and chiroptical properties of a novel, chiral helicene&#8208;NHC&#8722;Re(I) complex bearing an N&#8208;(aza[6]helicenyl)&#8208;benzimidazolylidene ligand are described, showing its ability to emit yellow circularly polarized luminescence. A comparative analysis of this new system with other helicene&#8208;Re(I) complexes reported to date illustrates the impact of structural modifications on the emissive and absorptive properties.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts by Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported. The keys to this advancement are: 1) one&#8208;pot, mild reaction conditions; 2) broad substrate scope; and 3) selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization.







Abstract
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective cyclization of cationic alkynes is a useful tool for the synthesis of biomolecules such as steroids. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204028), A. de&#8197;C&#243;zar, A. Arrieta and F.&#8197;P. Coss&#237;o analyze computationally how the nature of the alkyne determines the size of the ring and why the conformation of the fused rings dictates the stereoselectivity of the cyclization process.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derived Terephthalate Ligand Decorated TiO2 with Various Morphologies for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boost the capability of photocatalysts: We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid (TPA) ligand and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.&#8201;g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods) synthesized by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.&#8201;e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as the precursor.







Abstract
It has been rarely reported the morphological control of derivatives of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in hydrothermal conditions for photocatalytic applications. We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid/terephthalate (TPA) ligand and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.&#8201;g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods). The composites are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.&#8201;e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as precursor. The formation mechanism of composite materials with different morphological features is discussed. Impressively, the composite of TiO2 nanoparticles/TPA synthesized using H2O as solvent under hydrothermal condition exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 activity among the studied materials, with a photocatalytic H2 production rate of 6.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is approximately 7.5&#8208;fold higher than pure TiO2 (Degussa, P25) and prominent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 65&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the mechanism of boosted photocatalytic H2 production is discussed.

Molecular interactions are a combination of different attractive and repulsive forces. We have studied the delicate balance within a supramolecular [10]cycloparaphenylene&#8211;fullerene complex&#8212;both functionalized with alkyl esters&#8212;to evaluate the attractive and repulsive interplay between the substituents on the components. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A. Wegner and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300268).

         <title>Syntheses and Biofilm Reducing Effects of l&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Derived Analogues of the Fungal Macrocidins A and Z</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variations on ring size and polarity: Four hydroxy analogues of the fungal metabolites macrocidin A and Z were synthesised from fully and orthogonally protected l&#8208;dopa derivatives. They showed lesser growth inhibitory and dispersive effects on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms than the l&#8208;tyrosine derived natural leads or the new synthetic (S,S,S)&#8208;normacrocidin A. The more lipophilic hydroxymacrocidin Z analogues were generally more active than the polar hydroxymacrocidin A analogues, regardless of their para&#8208; or metacyclophane connectivity.







Abstract
Four analogues of the fungal metabolites macrocidin A and Z, featuring [13]para&#8208; or [13]metacyclophanes, were synthesised from fully and orthogonally protected l&#8208;dopa instead of l&#8208;tyrosine. They were tested for antibiotic activities and for effects on the growth and persistence of microbial biofilms. Tentative structure&#8208;activity relationships and distinct differences when compared with the natural lead compounds were identified.

An efficient long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent material was achieved based on the rigid structure provided by aromatic and piperidine rings of mBPipQ and the dense molecular arrangement of an epoxy resin, which stabilized triplet excitons. More importantly, these materials exhibit stable yellow&#8208;green phosphorescence emission after being immersed in strong acid or alkali solutions for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have drawn more attention due to their convenient preparation process and equally efficient phosphorescence performance in recent years. As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non&#8208;covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2&#8197;times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10&#8197;days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission. Utilizing the efficient phosphorescence emission and excellent abominable&#8208;solvent resistance of this RTP material, multilevel information encryption has been successfully demonstrated. This work broadens the application scope of polymeric RTP materials in harsh environments and provides a new idea for achieving efficient RTP emission.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Activatable Prodrug and Metal Prodrug Conjugate of Gossypol: Synthesis, Emergent Photophysical, Nanoscopic, Computational, and in&#8208;Vitro Cellular Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the reversible metal coordination behavior of metallothionine, we hypothesized that a similar strategy could be used to protect and stabilize the reactive functionality of the drug gossypol for its stimuli&#8208;responsive release. The reactive functionalities can be masked in two&#8208;stages by introducing pH&#8208;activatable imine bonds followed by metal ion coordination stabilizing and forming confined molecular structures to release the active drug at the site of action.







Abstract
The major hurdle to the success of many potent chemotherapeutic drugs is the lack of stability of their active form suited for a particular mode of action. Efforts are needed to stabilize such functionalities by employing new and novel strategies to overcome challenges. In this study, tumor&#8208;environment&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;activatable prodrug and metal&#8208;prodrug conjugate has been developed to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs bearing reactive functionalities. As a proof of concept, a pre&#8208;clinically tested natural compound, gossypol, was modified to form a pH&#8208;responsive prodrug by incorporating an imine linkage amenable to form confined molecular structures through coordination with a bio&#8208;relevant and nontoxic zinc metal ion. Detailed photophysical, computational, and nanoscopic studies revealed the unique zinc ion coordination behavior and its effect on molecular confinement. Computational studies demonstrated that an increasing degree of complexation, with Zn&#8208;N&#8722;Py coordination, gradually turns off fluorescence by reducing the band gap that allows nonradiative decay. In&#8208;vitro prodrug activation and release of gossypol from gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn were assessed by ESI&#8208;MS and RP&#8208;HPLC studies. The gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn demonstrated pH&#8208;specific cytotoxicity validated by the number of in&#8208;vitro cellular assays. Such a strategy can essentially be adapted to strengthen many chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance their efficacy and reduce side effects.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Masked Terminal Nickel&#8208;Oxide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel(II) complex reacted with peroxyphenylacetic acid to yield a nickel(III)&#8211;(hydr)oxide adduct (stabilized through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction to an acetate co&#8208;ligand) that displayed all the reactivity properties of a terminal nickel&#8208;oxide oxidant.







Abstract
In exploring terminal nickel&#8208;oxo complexes, postulated to be the active oxidant in natural and non&#8208;natural oxidation reactions, we report the synthesis of the pseudo&#8208;trigonal bipyramidal NiII complexes (K)[NiII(LPh)(DMF)] (1[DMF]) and (NMe4)2[NiII(LPh)(OAc)] (1[OAc]) (LPh=2,2&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tris&#8208;(N&#8208;phenylacetamide); DMF=N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; &#8722;OAc=acetate). Both complexes were characterized using NMR, FTIR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing the LPh ligand to bind in a tetradentate fashion, together with an ancillary donor. The reaction of 1[OAc] with peroxyphenyl acetic acid (PPAA) resulted in the formation of [(LPh)NiIII&#8722;O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OAc]2&#8722;, 2, that displays many of the characteristics of a terminal Ni=O species. 2 was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis, EPR, and XAS spectroscopies and ESI&#8208;MS. 2 decayed to yield a NiII&#8208;phenolate complex 3 (through aromatic electrophilic substitution) that was characterized by NMR, FTIR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. 2 was capable of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and epoxidation of olefins, as well as oxygen atom transfer oxidation of phosphines at exceptional rates. While the oxo&#8208;wall remains standing, this complex represents an excellent example of a masked metal&#8208;oxide that displays all of the properties expected of the ever elusive terminal M=O beyond the oxo&#8208;wall.

         <title>Melt Castable Derivatives of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic materials: In this work, the pentaerythritol backbone was modified with amine, nitramine and tetrazole functionalities leading to powerful melt castable pentaerythritol tetranitrate derivatives that outperform TNT. Exciting insights into the influence of these functionalities on mechanical sensitivities and melting behavior are observed and discussed.







Abstract
In the search for high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, the derivatization of known materials is an often&#8208;applied concept to fulfill modern&#8208;day demands. Surprisingly, the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or pharmaceutics. In this work, the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structurally similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalizations result in melting points in the range of 64 to 126&#8201;&#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.

         <title>Anion Modulated Expression of Chirality in Hydrogen Bond Templated Mechanically Chiral [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion recognition promotes the shuttling of the macrocyclic ring in mechanically chiral [2]rotaxanes. The position of the macrocycle is reported by changes in the diastereotopic behaviour in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. The macrocycle can be returned to its initial station upon removal of the anion.







Abstract
The syntheses of two novel mechanically chiral rotaxanes containing urea and squaramide motifs (in yields of 33&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively) are presented. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic titrations reveal shuttling of the macrocycle &#8211; detectable by modulation of the expression of mechanical chirality in the NMR spectrum &#8211; is possible through the addition of achiral chloride anions, a process which is reversed by the addition of sodium cations.

         <title>Structural Requirements of a Glycolipid MPIase for Membrane Protein Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MPIase is a glycolipid involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. To overcome the trace amounts and heterogeneity of natural MPIase, we systematically synthesized MPIase analogs. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed the contribution of distinctive functional groups and the effect of the MPIase glycan length on membrane protein integration activity. In addition, both the synergistic effects of these analogs with the membrane chaperone/insertase YidC, and the chaperone&#8208;like activity of the phosphorylated glycan were observed. These results verified the translocon&#8208;independent membrane integration mechanism in the inner membrane of E. coli, in which MPIase captures the highly hydrophobic nascent proteins via its characteristic functional groups, prevents protein aggregation, attracts the proteins to the membrane surface, and delivers them to YidC in order to regenerate its own integration activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Optimization of Detergents for Membrane Protein Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane protein purification by means of detergents is key to isolating membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets. The role of the detergent structure in this process, however, is not well understood. Detergents are optimized empirically, leading to failed preparations, and thereby raising costs. Here we evaluate the utility of the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was introduced by Griffin in 1949, for guiding the optimization of the hydrophobic tail in first&#8208;generation, dendritic oligoglycerol detergents ([G1] OGDs). Our findings deliver qualitative HLB guidelines for rationalizing the optimization of detergents. Moreover, [G1] OGDs exhibit strongly delipidating properties, regardless of the structure of the hydrophobic tail, which delivers a methodological enabling step for investigating binding strengths of endogenous lipids and their role for membrane protein oligomerization. Our findings will facilitate the analysis of challenging drug targets in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Conglomerates Mixed Crystals to Deracemize a Stable Racemic&#8208;Compound&#8208;Forming System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence of that possibility is given on three examples by using Temperature Cycling Induced Deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Elemental Magnesium as an Early Transition Metal Substitute: From Pentafulvene Coordination to Deprotonation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of magnesium turnings and 6,6&#8208;di&#8208;para&#8208;tolylpentafulvene was investigated. Under mild conditions, the magnesium dissolves, forming the MgII complex 1 with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#954;1 coordinating ligand of the dimerized pentafulvene, analyzed by NMR and XRD investigations. As a magnesium pentafulvene complex was a possible intermediate, amines were employed as intercepting agents. Thereby, the amines were formally deprotonated by elemental magnesium, yielding the first examples of Cp&#8217;Mg(THF)2NR2 complexes. This reaction competes with the formation of 1 and a consecutive formal [1,5]&#8208;H&#8208;shift forming an ansa&#8208;magnesocene. Employing amines with low basicity gave quantitative conversion to the amide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Enantioselective Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition and Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation in Stereodivergent, Multicomponent Coupling Reactions to Form Three Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereodivergent dual catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to selectively prepare all four stereoisomers in molecules containing two chiral centers from common starting materials. Most processes involve the use of two substrates, and it remains challenging to use dual catalyst approaches to generate molecules having three newly formed stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Here we report a multicomponent, stereodivergent method for the synthesis of targets containing three contiguous stereocenters by the combination of enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition and Ir&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation methodologies. Both cyclic and acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones undergo &#946;&#8208;arylation using aryl boron reagents to form an enolate nucleophile that can be subsequently allylated at the &#945;&#8208;position. The reactions proceed often with &gt;95% ee and with &gt;90:10 dr. Epimerization at the &#945;&#8208;carbonyl center enables the preparation of any of the eight possible stereoisomers from common starting materials, as demonstrated for cyclohexanone products.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Construction Of Molecular Borromean Rings And [2]catenane Utilizing Ether Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Cp*Rh&#8208;based discrete architectures were constructed through selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium(III) bimetallic construction units, respectively. This study demonstrates a strategy for making the transition from a binuclear D&#8208;shaped ring to a tetranuclear [2]catenane by adjusting the length of bipyridyl ligands. In addition, changing the position on the naphthyl group of the bipyridyl ligand from 2,6&#8208; to 1,5&#8208;position substitution can realize the selective synthesis of [2]catenane and Borromean Rings under a similar condition. The above&#8208;mentioned constructions have been determined via the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the detailed NMR techniques, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry analysis and the elemental analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide&#8208;BODIPY conjugates as bright fluorescent material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was achieved through a facile synthesis, affording two different GO&#8208;BODIPY conjugates where the main difference lies in the nature of the spacer and the type of bonds between the two components. The use of a long but flexible spacer afforded strong electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. This drastically altered the light absorption of the BODIPY structure and impeded its selective excitation. In contrast, the utilisation of a short, but rigid spacer based on boronic esters resulted in a perpendicular geometry of the phenyl boronic acid BODIPY (PBA&#8208;BODIPY) with respect to the GO plane, which enables only minor electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. In this case, selective excitation of PBA&#8208;BODIPY was easily achieved, allowing to investigate the excited state interactions. A quantitative ultrafast energy transfer from PBA&#8208;BODIPY to GO was observed. Furthermore, due to the reversible dynamic nature of the covalent GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY linkage, some PBA&#8208;BODIPY is free in solution and, hence, not quenched from GO. This resulted in a weak, but detectable fluorescence from the PBA&#8208;BODIPY that will allow to exploit GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY for slow release and imaging purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in a New Family of Photoactive Diimine&#8208;Diphosphine Copper(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of heteroleptic diimine&#8208;diphosphine copper(I) complexes is reported, with six new complexes compared to benchmark [Cu(bcp)(DPEPhos)]PF6. These new complexes are based on 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaphenanthrene (TAP) ligands with representative electronic properties as well as substitution patterns and DPEPhos and XantPhos as diphosphine ligands. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated and correlated with the number and position of substituents on the TAP ligands. Stern&#8208;Volmer studies using H&#252;nig&#8217;s base as reductive quencher demonstrated the influence of the complex photoreduction potential and of the excited state lifetime on the photoreactivity. This study refines the structure&#8208;property relationship profile for heteroleptic copper(I) complexes and confirms that such profiles are of high interest to design new copper complexes as optimized photoredox catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Regioselective E&#8594; Z Isomerization of Trienones with Cascade Sequences under Photosensitizer&#8208;Free Direct Irradiation at 390 nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective E &#8594; Z isomerization of a target olefin unit embedded in a conjugated polyene is challenging. Examples are limited only with retinal and its derivatives. The problem is further amplified when such an isomerization is integrated into cascade sequences, among which the regioselectivity and subsequent directionality are the major bottlenecks. Indeed, there are no reports till date for such a transformation. Herein, we report that such a controlled isomerization and subsequent cyclization cascade can be enabled by photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation of linearly conjugated acyclic polyenes in dichloromethane solvent using a 390 nm LED. The directionality results from deconjugation of the extended &#960;&#8208;system in the transient Z&#8208;isomer due to stabilizing n &#8594; &#960;* interactions between 1,4&#8210;dicarbonyls (C=O&#8594;C=O) or 1,4&#8210;carbonyl/&#8210;aryl (C=O&#8594;aryl) groups. The involvement of such noncovalent interactions has been supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography and control experiments. Thus, conjugated trienones can be converted into the oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes stereoselectively in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic manner, including the first example via regioselective isomerization of a tetrasubstituted alkene. The reaction conditions are very general (&gt;46 examples) and can be conducted in an open air at ambient temperature. Such a cascade cyclization can also be realized in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Stabilizers on Anticancer and Antibacterial Activity of AgBiS2 Nanomaterial</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbing AgBiS2 nanoparticles can be excited by single&#8208;wavelength light, which is the primary characteristic of a photoresponsive platform. Chemical synthesis of nanomaterials inevitably requires long&#8208;chain organic surfactants or polymers to stabilize them in the nano regime. These stabilizing molecules barricade the interaction of nanomaterials with biological cells. We have produced stabilizer&#8208;free (sf&#8208;AgBiS2) and polymer&#8208;coated (PEG&#8208;AgBiS2) nanoparticles; and assessed their anticancer and antibacterial activity to evaluate the effect of stabilizers. sf&#8208;AgBiS2 showed better antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and displayed excellent cytotoxicity against HeLa cells compared to PEG&#8208;AgBiS2. The photothermal therapy (PTT) results illustrated the tumor ablation ability of sf&#8208;AgBiS2, which converted light into heat effectively up to 53.3&#176;C under NIR irradiation. This work demonstrates the importance of synthesizing stabilizer&#8208;free nanoparticles to produce safe and highly active PTT agents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Anionic Ligands on Photoreactivity in Mo(VI) Dioxo Complexes of the Form MoO2X2(NN); NN= 2,2&#180;&#8208;Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable Elastomeric Network with Dynamic Disulfide, Imine, and Hydrogen Bonds for Flexible Strain Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate and conductive layer was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability and good mechanical integrity. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3 sensor had high sensitivity, short response time, and long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healable and stretchable elastomeric material is essential for the development of flexible electronics devices to ensure their stable performance. In this study, a strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate (PIH2T1&#8208;tri, containing multiple reversible repairing sites such as disulfide, imine, and hydrogen bonds) and conductive layer (carbon nanotube, CNT) was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency=91&#8201;%). It exhibited good mechanical integrity in terms of elongation at break (672&#8201;%), tensile strength (1.41&#8197;MPa). The Young's modulus (0.39&#8197;MPa) was close to that of human skin. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3 sensor also demonstrated an effective self&#8208;healing function for electrical conduction and sensing property. Meanwhile, it had high sensitivity (gauge factor (GF)=24.1), short response time (120&#8197;ms), and long&#8208;term durability (4000&#8197;cycles). This study offers a novel self&#8208;healable elastomer platform with carbon based conductive components to develop flexible strain sensors towards high performance soft electronics.

         <title>Preparation of Ropivacaine Encapsulated by Zeolite Imidazole Framework Microspheres as Sustained&#8208;Release System and Efficacy Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ropivacaine microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) as sustained&#8208;release system was prepared for the first time. This novel material exhibits a high drug loading rate and superior biological safety, with a continuously release in&#8197;vitro for at least 96&#8197;h, and the sensory block time was more than 72&#8197;h in&#8197;vivo pharmacodynamic.







Abstract
The management of persistent postoperative pain still remains a clinical challenge currently. Although ropivacaine (RVC) is widely used for postoperative analgesia as a local anesthetic, the short half&#8208;life makes it difficult to achieve the desired duration of analgesia. Herein, a RVC sustained&#8208;release microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework&#8208;8 (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) was synthesized for the first time, which prolonged the sustained&#8208;release of RVC and decreased the resulting drug toxicity. RVC can continuously release in&#8197;vitro for at least 96&#8197;h with high drug loading of 30.6&#8201;% and RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 had excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. In sciatic nerve block model, the sensory block time of RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 was significantly prolonged compared with RVC, achieving more than 72&#8197;h post injection and no inflammation or lesion were found. Based on high drug loading, ideal sustained&#8208;release and superior biological safety, RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 will be a novel delivery material for local anesthetic with potential application.

         <title>Reactivity of Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Geminal Al/P and Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs towards Heterocumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated pairs&#8217; different preferences: The geminal oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=CH(SiMe3)2) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 show different reactivities towards heterocumulenes (PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2, PhNSO) and sulfur dioxide. Whereas the P&#8722;O&#8722;Al FLP forms stable adducts with all substrates except for SO2, the P&#8722;O&#8722;Si FLP does not form adducts with sulfur bound to silicon.







Abstract
The two oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=CH(SiMe3)2; 1) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (2) were reacted with the heterocumulenes PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2 and PhNSO as well as SO2. With isocyanate and cyanate, both 1 and 2, form addition products under formation of five&#8208;membered rings. With CS2, isothiocyanate and sulfinylaniline, only 1 forms stable adducts, whereas 2 shows reactivity towards sulfinylaniline, but the product decomposed after a few minutes. The reaction of 1 with SO2 led to partial cleavage of the P&#8722;O&#8722;Al and Al&#8722;C units, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of 2 with SO2 affords the 1,2&#8208;addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and CHN analyses.

         <title>In Vivo Applications of Bioorthogonal Reactions: Chemistry and Targeting Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to reactions that can proceed in biological systems without interfering with biological processes. It has enabled the study of biomolecules in their native environment and has facilitated advanced imaging and diagnostic applications. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203942), M.&#8197;M.&#8197;A. Mitry, F. Greco and H.&#8197;M.&#8197;I. Osborn critically appraise the suitability of bioorthogonal reactions for in vivo applications. Areas of focus are chemical reactions and the targeting mechanisms used to deliver the bioorthogonal reactions&#8217; components.

         <title>Regulating Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of the Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sugar moiety of the antifreeze glycoprotein AFGP can form a unique dynamic water phase that includes disordered water molecules thereby inhibiting the freezing process. The property of this water phase seems to depend on both the structure and the number of sugar moieties. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Okamoto, Y. Kajihara, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203553).

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Transfer Dynamics of Organic Polymer Nanoparticles with Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene nanoparticles with graphene oxide (p3ht NPs&#8208;GO &amp; p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO) were prepared, and revealed the properties of charge transfer complexes. Notably, ultrafast electron transfer in those composites was reported for the first time, and faster electron transfer in p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have higher application values for organic polymer solar cells.







Abstract
We prepared organic polymer poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (p3ht) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide (GO)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO by using the reprecipitation method. We demonstrated that GO/RGO could improve the ordering and planarity of p3ht chains as well as the formation of p3ht NPs, and confirmed the effects of GO/RGO on the fluorescence and carrier transport dynamics of p3ht NPs by using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) techniques. Ultrafast electron transfer (&#8764;1&#8197;ps) between GO/RGO and p3ht NPs quenched the fluorescence of p3ht NPs, indicating excellent properties of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO as the charge transfer complexes. Efficient electron transfer may promote the applications of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO composites in organic polymer solar cells and photocatalysis. Moreover, RGO had stronger interfacial interactions and more matched conduction band energy levels with p3ht NPs than GO did, which implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have greater application values than p3ht NPs&#8208;GO.

         <title>Zigzag&#8208;Edged Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Benzo[m]tetraphene Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic strategy was developed to achieve zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation from &#8220;U&#8208;shaped&#8221; benzo[m]tetraphene&#8208;based precursors. The experimental and theoretical investigations elucidated the edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent effect on the electronic structures and optical properties. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy disclosed the modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension.







Abstract
A series of zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Z1&#8208;Z3) were synthesized from 2,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;benzo[m]tetraphene (9) as a versatile building block. Their structures were unambiguously confirmed by laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, Raman, and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies as well as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fingerprint vibrational modes were elucidated with theoretical support. The edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent optical properties were characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed distinct modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension from Z1 to Z2, the latter having a gulf edge.

         <title>Selective Chelation of the Exotic Meitner&#8208;Auger Emitter Mercury&#8208;197&#8201;m/g with Sulfur&#8208;Rich Macrocyclic Ligands: Towards the Future of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sulfur&#8208;rich macrocyclic chelators were synthesized; their ability to bind Hg2+ was studied. The validity of these chelators for 197m/gHg2+ radiopharmaceutical incorporation was investigated through radiolabeling studies and in&#8197;vitro stability assays. The importance of sulfur coordinating atoms was rationalized, thus helping to design 197m/gHg2+ chelators for nuclear medicine applications.







Abstract
Mercury&#8208;197&#8197;m/g are a promising pair of radioactive isomers for incorporation into a theranostic as they can be used as a diagnostic agent using SPECT imaging and a therapeutic via Meitner&#8208;Auger electron emissions. However, the current absence of ligands able to stably coordinate 197m/gHg to a tumour&#8208;targeting vector precludes their use in&#8197;vivo. To address this, we report herein a series of sulfur&#8208;rich chelators capable of incorporating 197m/gHg into a radiopharmaceutical. 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecane (NS4) and its derivatives, (2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetic acid (NS4&#8208;CA) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetamide (NS4&#8208;BA), were designed, synthesized and analyzed for their ability to coordinate Hg2+ through a combination of theoretical (DFT) and experimental coordination chemistry studies (NMR and mass spectrometry) as well as 197m/gHg radiolabeling studies and in&#8197;vitro stability assays. The development of stable ligands for 197m/gHg reported herein is extremely impactful as it would enable their use for in&#8197;vivo imaging and therapy, leading to personalized treatments for cancer.

         <title>Copper (I) Chloride&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Synthesis of Multifunctionalized Compounds at Room Temperature and Their Antifungal Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and highly efficient copper photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of BQ, alkyl/aryl alcohols, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes forms highly functionalized products at room temperature. The late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good anti&#8208;Candida krusei and anti&#8208;Candida glabrata activities with lower cytotoxicities than that of fluconazole, the standard antifungal medicine.







Abstract
A simple visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced CuCl&#8208;catalyzed synthesis was developed for highly functionalized carbon&#8208;centered compounds (&#945;&#8208;alk/aryloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diaryl/alkylaryl&#8208;acetaldehydes/ketones) at room temperature using benzoquinone, alkyl/aryl alcohol, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes. Late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good antifungal activities, especially against Candida krusei fungal strain, in in&#8197;vitro experiments (the Broth microdilution method). Moreover, toxicity tests (zebrafish egg model experiments) indicated that these compounds had negligible cytotoxicity. The green chemistry metrics (E&#8208;factor value is 7.3) and eco&#8208;scale (eco&#8208;scale value is 58.8) evaluations show that the method is simple, mild, highly efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and environmentally feasible.

&lt;p&gt;A simple visible-light-induced CuCl-catalyzed synthesis was developed for highly functionalized carbon-centered compounds (&#945;-alk/aryloxy-&#945;-diaryl/alkylaryl-acetaldehydes/ketones) at room temperature using benzoquinone, alkyl/aryl alcohol, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes. Late-stage functionalized compounds show good antifungal activities, especially against &lt;i&gt;Candida krusei&lt;/i&gt; fungal strain, in in&#8197;vitro experiments (the Broth microdilution method). Moreover, toxicity tests (zebrafish egg model experiments) indicated that these compounds had negligible cytotoxicity. The green chemistry metrics (E-factor value is 7.3) and eco-scale (eco-scale value is 58.8) evaluations show that the method is simple, mild, highly efficient, eco-friendly, and environmentally feasible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Widening the Landscape of Small Molecule Activation with Gold&#8208;Aluminyl Complexes: A Systematic Study of E&#8722;H (E=O, N) Bonds, SO2 and N2O Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional properties of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes are predicted to lead to thermodynamically and kinetically feasible activation of E&#8722;H (E=N, O) bonds of ammonia and water, as well as SO2 capture and N2O reduction (all reactions are exergonic with barriers lower than 15&#8197;kcal/mol at 298&#8197;K). The N2O reduction is also predicted to lead to feasible catalytic redox cycles using N2O as an O&#8208;atom source and, unprecedently, the gold&#8208;aluminyl complex as a catalyst.







Abstract
The electronic features of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes have been thoroughly explored. Their similarity with Group&#8197;14 dimetallenes and other metal&#8208;aluminyl complexes suggests that their reactivity with small molecules beyond carbon dioxide could be accessed. In this work, the reactivity of the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6 diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;ditert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) complex towards water, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide is computationally explored. The reaction mechanisms computed for each substrate strongly suggest that all activation processes are in principle experimentally feasible. Electronic structure analysis highlights that, in all cases, the reactivity is driven by the presence of the poorly polarized electron&#8208;sharing gold&#8208;aluminyl bond, which induces a radical&#8208;like reactivity of the complex towards all the substrates. A flat topology of the potential energy surface (PES) has been found for the reaction with N2O, where two almost isoenergetic transition states can be located along the same reaction coordinate with different geometries, suggesting that the N2O binding mode may not be a good indicator of the nature of N2O activation in a cooperative bimetallic reactivity. In addition, the catalytic potentialities of these complexes have been explored in the framework of nitrous oxide reduction. The study reveals that the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex might be an efficient catalyst towards oxidation of phosphines (and boranes) via N2O reduction. These findings underline recurring trends in the novel chemistry of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes and call for experimental feedbacks.

         <title>Hexaphenyltriphenylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages: Host&#8211;Guest Complexation for White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hexaphenyltriphenylene(HPT)&#8208;based metallacages showing intense blue emission both in the solution and solid state were prepared via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly. They can serve as hosts to complex with three planar fluorescent dyes, and bright white light can be generated when they complex with PDI derivatives.







Abstract
A hexaphenyltriphenylene&#8208;based hexatopic pyridyl ligand is designed and used to prepare three hexagonal prismatic metallacages via metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the planar conjugated structures of the hexaphenyltriphenylene skeleton, such metallacages show good host&#8211;guest complexation with a series of emissive dyes, which have been further used to tune their emission in solution. Interestingly, based on their complementary emission colors, white light emission is achieved in a mixture of the host metallacages and the guests.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Bis&#8208;pentafluoroarylated Anthracene Derivatives for N&#8208;type Organic&#8208;Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of two pentafluorophenyl groups into anthracene through direct C&#8722;H arylation is demonstrated. This facile method enabled the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions in a single step. Among them, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (2,6&#8208;DPA&#8722;F) serves as an n&#8208;type semiconductor in OFETs, exhibiting an electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm2/V.







Abstract
Diphenylanthracene (DPA) and its derivatives are promising semiconducting materials for p&#8208;type organic&#8208;field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, to develop n&#8208;type semiconducting materials with an anthracene core, pentafluorobenzene was introduced into anthracene by C&#8722;H direct arylation, enabling the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (DPA&#8722;F) derivatives. The high reactivity of the pentafluorobenzene C&#8722;H bond allows direct arylation for synthesizing DPA&#8722;F derivatives in a single step. The introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups provides the anthracene derivatives with n&#8208;type semiconducting properties, in contrast to the p&#8208;type properties of the parent DPAs. Among the synthesized compounds, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene shows a high electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm2/Vs and an on/off ratio&gt;106 in OFETs. The high crystallinity results in the smooth electron transport. This study provides a facile synthetic method for n&#8208;type semiconducting materials and insights into the molecular design of the positional effects of aromatic substituents on anthracene.

         <dc:description>
With amorphisation, a simple and effective approach, it is possible to introduce atomic defects and short&#8208;range ordering into catalyst materials. The abundance of defects and dangling bonds improves the intrinsic activity and photocatalytic stability. In their Perspective (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203810), S.&#8208;I. In and co&#8208;workers discuss how amorphisation offers a novel and powerful method to avoid the slow kinetics of CO2 reduction in rigid crystalline catalysis, resulting in higher performance for CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Insight into the Evolution Track for the Metathesis of Alkenes within Hierarchical Zeolite&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The usage of hierarchical MFI zeolite enables the boosting catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based catalysts for the olefin&#8208;metathesis reaction. The harvest of active catalysts roots from a segmental evolution track between hierarchical zeolite and Al2O3 slices for the fabrication of active sites. The working evolution track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, Al2O3 slices and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The infilling of disaggregated Al2O3 slices into the intracrystalline mesopores triggers the creation of localized intrazeolite&#8208;Al2O3 interface, which enable the subsequent migration and trapping of surface molybdates into the micropores. The insulation of intrazeolite&#8208;Al2O3 interface or shielding of zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites leads to the break of the evolution track. Our findings disclose the hidden functionality of mesoporosity as intrazeolite interface boundary for the fabrication of active sites and supply the new strategy for the rational design of zeolite catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photomodulation on Active Sites of Adsorbents: Controllable Adsorption Processes with Improved Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption is a widely applied technique in producing high&#8208;purity chemicals with advantages of low energy consumption, high selectivity, and mild operating conditions. However, traditional adsorbents have inflexible properties and suffer from the trade&#8208;off between selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Recently, the emerging photoresponsive adsorbents have provided new avenues for adsorption techniques. Active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be regulated through steric hindrance or tunable adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interactions. Therefore, variation in adsorptive capacity is able to readily achieve through photomodulation, and the corresponding adsorption/desorption cycles are energy&#8208;saving. This concept mainly summarizes recent efforts on the fabrication and application of photoresponsive adsorbents with tunable active sites. Also, the future opportunities and critical challenges of photoregulation on adsorptive sites are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning the Properties of Stapled Peptides by Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide stapling represents a versatile strategy to generate peptide derivatives with stable helical structures. While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated &#945;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs of an interleukin&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the IL&#8208;17A&#8208;binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (L/D) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL&#8208;17A&#8208;inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxymethylene Ether (OME) Fuel Catalyst Screening Using in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Online NMR measurements are introduced in the current study as a new analytical setup for investigation of the oxymethylene dimethyl ether (OME) synthesis. For the validation of the setup, the newly established method is compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas chromatographic analysis. Afterwards, the influence of different parameters, such as temperature, catalyst concentration and catalyst type on the OME fuel formation based on trioxane and dimethoxymethane is investigated. As catalysts, AmberlystTM 15 (A15) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) are utilized. A kinetic model is applied to describe the reaction in more detail. Based on these results, the activation energy (A15: 46.3 kJ mol &#8208;1 and TfOH: 79.8 kJ mol&#8208;1) and the order in catalyst (A15: 0.8 and TfOH: 2.2) are calculated and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium Pentafulvene Complexes: Synthon for Unprecedented VanadoceneIII Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8208;C6H6) (1) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (2a and 2b) and benzofulvene complexes (3a and 3b). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordination mode with a vanadiumIII center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6&#8208;dimethylpentafulvene, a C&#8211;H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring&#8208;substituted vanadoceneII4. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadoceneIII compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E&#8211;H splitting of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadoceneIII phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V&#8211;Cexo bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4&#8208;chlorobenzonitril and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Chemistry of Complex Alkaloids: Combining Targeted Molecular Networking Approach and Semisynthetic Strategy to Access Rare Communesins in a Marine&#8208;Derived Penicillium expansum.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Communesins are rare alkaloids isolated from fungi of the genus Penicillium. In this work, the extract of a marine&#8208;derived Penicillium expansum strain was studied using targeted molecular networking approach allowing to detect 65 communesins including 55 novels. A fragmentation pattern for dimethylvinyl communesins was established and a script was implemented allowing to predict the structure and map all communesins in a global molecular network. A semisynthetic strategy was carried out to obtain some minor congeners from the two isolated communesins A and B. Nine communesins were then synthetised: two of them were already described as produced by the studied strain; four are new natural products which occurrence in the extracts was confirmed; three are new semi&#8208;synthetic analogues never described so far. These communesins were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on two human cancer cell lines KB and MCF&#8208;7 leading to a preliminary study of their structure&#8208;activity relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of Enantioenriched Epoxides and Triols from Biomass&#8208;Derived Synthons Driven by Specifically Designed Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor&#8208;made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an effective aldolase with 160&#8208;fold increased activity compared to 4OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4&#8208;OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4&#8208;OT mutant, in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98% ee) from biomass&#8208;derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three&#8208;step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3&#8208;prim,sec,sec&#8208;triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor&#8208;less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass&#8208;based synthons.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multi-enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor-made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) into an effective aldolase with 160-fold increased activity compared to 4OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4-OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4-OT mutant, in a one-pot two-step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98% ee) from biomass-derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three-step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3-prim,sec,sec-triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one-pot, three-step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor-less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass-based synthons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;line Multidimensional NMR Monitoring of Photochemical Flow Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. Ultrafast 2D NMR experiments acquired in&#8208;line yield useful quantitative information in just 40&#8197;s.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. The reaction mixture exiting the flow reactor is flown through the NMR spectrometer and directly analyzed. In the case of simple substrates, suitable information can be obtained through 1D 1H spectra, but for molecules of higher complexity the use of 2D experiments is key to address signal overlaps and assignment issues. Here we show the usefulness of ultrafast 2D COSY experiments acquired in 70&#8197;s or less, for the in&#8208;line monitoring of photochemical reactions, and the possibility to obtain reliable quantitative information. This is a powerful framework to, for example, efficiently screen reaction conditions.

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Modulation of Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered supramolecular chiral assemblies have aroused great attention. According to the different interaction ways between light and system, we mainly summarized non&#8208;polarized light and circularly polarized light (CP light) triggered chiral assemblies. Non&#8208;polarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by the introduction of photoactive components. As a chiral light source, CP light can directly induce the asymmetric assembly of organic molecules and asymmetric photosynthesis of inorganic metal nanostructures. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. Furthermore, many relevant functional applications were also presented.







Abstract
Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.&#8201;g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene) or photo&#8208;induced directionally rotating molecular motors were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of circularly polarized light have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Confined NiCo Alloy Hollow Spheres as an Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring cost&#8208;efficient/durability bifunctional electrocatalysts are of upmost importance for the practical application of metal&#8211;air batteries. However, preparing bifunctional electrocatalysts with the above three advantages remains conceptually challenging. This work reports the preparation of N&#8208;doped carbon confined NiCo alloy hollow spheres (NiCo@N&#8208;C HS) as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn&#8208;air battery with a higher energy density (788.7 mWh gZn&#8208;1) and outstanding cycling stability (over 200 h), which are more durable than the commercialized Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based device. Electrochemical results and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the synergy in the NiCo@N&#8208;C accelerates the electronic transmission for improving activation of O2* and OH* intermediates and optimizing reacted free energy pathways, while the hollow structures exposure more active sites for improving the reaction kinetics and enhancing the activity of ORR/OER reaction. This work provides crucial understanding for constructing low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based catalyst to overcome the e&#64259;ciency and durability barriers of metal&#8208;air batteries for widespread applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (cymantrene) is known to undergo photochemical reactions by releasing one of its CO ligands. Here we present the first example of a photorearrangement of a cymantrenylmethyl fragment, where it retains all its three CO ligands. A tandem experimental and DFT (density functional theory)&#8208;based computational investigation allows us to explain this unexpected behavior: the rearrangement, indeed, begins with the release of one CO ligand, but cage effect of the solvent (benzene or cyclohexane) captures this CO molecule, allowing it to rapidly reattach once the rearrangement takes place.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral and structural polymorphism of fibril architectures of homologous lysozymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid fibrils are fascinating and complex structures with the multilayered chiral organization. Using the multimodal methodology, including VCD, ECD, cryo&#8208;EM, and TEM, we characterized in detail different levels of organization (secondary structure/protofilament/mesoscopic structure) of amyloid fibrils prepared from proteins highly homologous in structure (hen egg white and human lysozymes). Our results demonstrate that small changes in the native protein structure or preparation conditions translate into significant differences in the handedness and architecture of the formed fibrils at various levels of their complexity. In particular, fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes obtained in vitro at the same preparation conditions, possess different secondary structure, protofilament twist and ultrastructure. Yet, formed fibrils adopted a relatively similar mesoscopic structure, as observed in high&#8208;resolution 3D cryo&#8208;EM, scarcely used up to now for fibrils obtained in vitro in denaturing condition. Our results add to other puzzling experiments implicating the indeterministic nature of fibril formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient K&#8208;storage of Fe&#8208;coupled organic molecule anode in ether&#8208;based electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given these advantages of widely designable structures and environmentally friendly characteristics, organic electrode materials (OEMs) are considered to be promising electrode materials for alkaline metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, their large&#8208;scale application is hampered by insufficient specific capacity and rate performance. Here, Fe2+ is coupled to the anhydride molecule NTCDA to form a novel K&#8208;storage anode Fe&#8208;NTCDA. In this way, the working potential of Fe&#8208;NTCDA anode is reduced, which makes it more suitable to be used as an anode material. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved due to the increase in K&#8208;storage sites. Moreover, electrolyte regulation is implemented to optimize the K&#8208;storage behavior, resulting into a high specific capacity of 167 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 50 mA/g and 114 mAh/g even at 500 mA/g in the 3 M KFSI/DME electrolyte.</dc:description>

However, their large-scale application is hampered by insufficient specific capacity and rate performance. Here, Fe2+ is coupled to the anhydride molecule NTCDA to form a novel K-storage anode Fe-NTCDA. In this way, the working potential of Fe-NTCDA anode is reduced, which makes it more suitable to be used as an anode material. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved due to the increase in K-storage sites. Moreover, electrolyte regulation is implemented to optimize the K-storage behavior, resulting into a high specific capacity of 167 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 50 mA/g and 114 mAh/g even at 500 mA/g in the 3 M KFSI/DME electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral  atrop BIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97:3 er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5:3.5 er).</dc:description>

         <title>Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica Nanomaterials with Unconventional Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) are high surface area organic&#8210;inorganic hybrid nanomaterials that have found broad applications in various fields of research such as in (bio)chemistry or in material science. By choosing suitable organic groups in the framework of these materials, their surface properties such as polarity, optical/electrical characteristics and adsorption capacity can be tuned. This critical review provides an overview of the current state of the art in the developments and applications of some PMO nanomaterials in diverse fields of research. We place this in the context of four leading areas of PMO nanomaterials, including chiral PMOs, plugged PMO nanomaterials, Janus PMOs and PMO&#8208;based nanomotors. The review briefly discusses the recent and key findings on these PMO nanomaterials as well as their potential applications for future developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Cations: Fluoride Ion Abstraction, Isocyanide Coordination, and Impact of Steric Bulk on Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular compound [BiDipp2(SbF6)], containing the bulky, donor&#8208;free bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+ has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Using its methyl analog [BiMe2(SbF6)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity has been investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and modified Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards (PF6)&#8211; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; have revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively. The first examples of compounds featuring bismuth&#8208;bound isocyanides have been isolated and fully characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Peracid oxidation of unactivated sp3 C&#8212;H bonds: An important solvent effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peracid oxidation of hydrocarbons in chlorinated solvents is a low yielding and poorly selective process. Through a combination of DFT calculations, spectroscopic studies and kinetic measurement we show the origins of this is electronic in nature and can be influenced through the addition of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). Performing the reaction of a cycloalkane with mCPBA in a fluorinated alcohol solvent such as nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol (NFTB) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which act as strong HBD and poor HBA, leads to significantly higher yields and selectivities being observed for the alcohol product. Application of the optimised reaction conditions allows for the selective oxidation of both cyclic and linear alkane substrates delivering the corresponding alcohol in up to 86% yield. The transformation shows selectivity for tertiary centres over secondary centres and the oxidation of secondary centres is strongly influenced by stereoelectronic effects. Primary centres are not oxidised by this method. A simple computational model developed to understand this transformation provides a powerful tool to reliably predict the influence of substitution and functionality on reaction outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest of Quadruple Bonding Between Two Main&#8208;Group Atoms in AeB&#8208; and AeC (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba) and the Role of d Orbitals of Heavier Alkaline&#8208;Earth Atoms in Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(6,8)/def2&#8208;QZVPP and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPP levels as well as density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeB&#8208; and isoelectronic AeC (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba). The boride anions AeB&#8208; have an electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) ground state. The quintet (5&#931;&#8208;) state is 5.8 &#8211; 12.3 kcal/mol higher in energy and the singlet (1&#916;) state is 13.1 &#8211; 15.3 kcal/mol above the triplet. The isoelectronic AeC molecules are also predicted to have a low&#8208;lying triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) state but the quintet (5&#931;&#8208;) state is only 2.2 kcal/mol (SrC) and 2.9 kcal/mol (CaC) above the triplet state. The triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) and quintet (5&#931;&#8208;) states of BaC are nearly isoenergetic. All systems have rather strong bonds. The calculated bond dissociation energies of the triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) state are between De = 38.3 &#8211; 41.7 kcal/mol for AeB&#8208; and De = 49.4 &#8211; 57.5 kcal/mol for AeC. The barium species have always the strongest bonds whereas the calcium and strontium compounds have similar BDEs. The bonding analysis indicates that there is little charge migration in AeB&#8208; in the direction Ae&#8594;B&#8208; where the alkaline earth atoms carry positive charges between 0.09 e &#8208; 0.22 e. The positive charges at the Ae atoms are much larger in AeC where the charge migration Ae&#8594;C is between 0.90 e &#8211; 0.91 e. A detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions with the EDA&#8208;NOCV method shows that all diatomic species AeB&#8208; and AeC are built from dative interactions between Ae (1S, ns2) and B&#8722; or C (3P, 2s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;1). The eventually formed bonds in AeC are better described in terms of interactions between the ions Ae+ (2S, ns1) + C&#8722; (4S, 2s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;12p&#963;1). Inspection of the orbital interactions suggests that the alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use mainly their (n&#8208;1)d AOs besides the (n)s AOs for the covalent bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;Glucans via Stereoselective Iterative Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucans are major biomaterials on the earth, with &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.e., amylose) and &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.e., cellulose) being the most abundant ones, which are relevant to energy storage and structural function, respectively. Interestingly, (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans with alternate &#945;/&#946;&#8208;linkages, namely herewith amycellulose, have never been disclosed in nature. Here we report a robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkages, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates as donors, TMSNTf2 as promoter, CH2Cl2/nitrile or CH2Cl2/THF as solvents. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by coupling five imidate donors with eight glycosyl acceptors, in which most of the glycosylations lead to high yield and exclusively 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selectivity. Applying this glycosylation protocol and with an iterative manner, the unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans up to a 16&#8208;mer have been synthesized. Differently from amylose, that adopts a compact helicoidal arrangement, the synthetic amycellulose features an extended ribbon&#8208;like conformation, comparable to the extended shape of cellulose.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glucans are major biomaterials on the earth, with &#945;-(1&#8594;4)-glucans (i.e., amylose) and &#946;-(1&#8594;4)-glucans (i.e., cellulose) being the most abundant ones, which are relevant to energy storage and structural function, respectively.
