      <title>Smart Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Nanoparticles with Tunable Perlyene Fluorescence in the Organic Interlayer</title>
      <dc:description>A new series of  shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell  (  SbS  )&#8208;functionalized Al  2  O  3  nanoparticles (NPs) containing a perylene core in the organic interlayer as a fluorescence marker is introduced. Initially, the NPs were functionalized with both, a fluorescent perylene phosphonic acid derivative, together with the lipophilic hexadecylphosphonic acid or the fluorophilic (1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;perfluorodecyl)phosphonic acid. The lipophilic first&#8208;shell functionalized NPs were further implemented with amphiphiles built of aliphatic chains and polar head&#8208;groups. However, the fluorophilic NPs were combined with amphiphiles consisting of fluorocarbon tails and polar head&#8208;groups. Depending on the nature of the combined phosphonic acids and the amphiphiles, tuning of the perylene fluorescence can be accomplished due variations of supramolecular organization with the shell interface. Because the  SbS  &#8208;functionalized NPs dispose excellent dispersibility in water and in biological media, two sorts of NPs with different surface properties were tested with respect to biological fluorescent imaging applications. Depending on the agglomeration of the NPs, the cellular uptake differs. The uptake of larger agglomerates is facilitated by endocytosis, whereas individualized NPs cross directly the cellular membrane. Also, the larger agglomerates were preferentially incorporated by all tested cells.</dc:description>

      <title>A Streamlined Regenerative Glycosylation Reaction: Direct, Acid&#8208;Free Activation of Thioglycosides</title>
      <dc:description>Our group has previously reported that 3,3&#8208;difluoroxindole (HOFox) is able to mediate glycosylations via intermediacy of OFox imidates. Thioglycoside precursors were first converted into the corresponding glycosyl bromides that were then converted into the OFox imidates in the presence of Ag  2  O followed by the activation with catalytic Lewis acid in a regenerative fashion. Reported herein is a direct conversion of thioglycosides via the regenerative approach that bypasses the intermediacy of bromides and eliminates the need for heavy metal&#8208;based promoters. The direct regenerative activation of thioglycosides is achieved under neural reaction conditions using only 1 equiv NIS and catalytic HOFox without the acidic additives</dc:description>

      <title>Acidic monosaccharides become incorporated into calcite single crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrates, along with proteins and peptides, are known to represent a major class of biomacromolecules involved in calcium carbonate biomineralization. However, in spite of multiple physical or biochemical characterizations, the explicit role of saccharide macromolecules (long chains of carbohydrate molecules) is not yet understood in mineral deposition. In the present study we investigated the influence of two common acidic monosaccharides (MSs), which are the simplest form of carbohydrates and are represented here by glucuronic and galacturonic acids, on the formation of calcite crystals  in vitro  . We show that the size, morphology and microstructure of calcite crystals are altered when they are grown in the presence of these MSs. More importantly, MSs were found to become incorporated into the calcite crystalline lattice and induce anisotropic lattice distortions, a widely studied phenomenon in other biomolecules related to CaCO  3  biomineralization but never before reported in the case of single MSs. Changes in the calcite lattice induced by MS incorporation were precisely determined by the technique of high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. We believe that the results of this research may deepen our understanding of the interaction of saccharide polymers with an inorganic host and shed light on the implications of carbohydrates for biomineralization processes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Water&#8208;Gated Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistor for Glyphosate Detection: A Comparative Study with Fluorescence Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>We here propose a design of a highly sensitive solid&#8208;state sensor device based on a water&#8208;gated organic thin&#8208;film transistor (WG&#8208;OTFT) for the selective detection of herbicide glyphosate (GlyP) in water. A competitive assay among carboxylate&#8208;functionalized polythiophene, Cu  2+  , and GlyP was employed as a sensing mechanism. Molecular recognition phenomena and electrical double layer (EDL) (at the polymer/water interface) originated from the field&#8208;effect worked cooperatively to amplify the sensitivity for GlyP. The limit of detection of WG&#8208;OTFT (0.26 ppm) was lower than that of a fluorescence sensor chip (0.95 ppm) which are conventional sensing methods. In contrast to the previously reported insulated molecular wires to block interchain interactions, molecular aggregates under the field&#8208;effect has shown to be effective for amplification of sensitivity through &#8220;intra&#8221;&#8208; and &#8220;inter&#8221;&#8208;molecular wire effects. The opposite strategy in this study would pave the way for fully pulling out the sensing property of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state sensor devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Simple Synthesis of a Heterocyclophane Exhibiting Anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met Activity by Acting as a Hatch Blocking Access to the Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>A simple approach to the synthesis of heterocyclophane consisting of two 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bithiazoles has been developed in mild conditions. The heterocyclophane with two short chains was conveniently prepared by Hantzsch thiazoles synthesis using the reaction of 3&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxycarbonyl&#8208;3&#8208;azapentanethiocarboxamide with 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione in methanol under reflux for only 15 minutes. Amino groups at the linkers of this heterocyclophane can be functionalized to give acylated and carbamate derivatives. Their properties as protein kinase inhibitors were investigated, and one of the heterocyclophanes exhibited specific c&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) anti&#8208;activity (IC  50  = 603 nM) among 7 types of protein kinases investigated. The computational site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method was used to determine why the one heterocyclophane exhibited strong anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Through the Looking Glass: Chiral Recognition of Substrates and Products at the Active Sites of Racemases and Epimerases</title>
      <dc:description>
Racemases and epimerases catalyze the reversible interconversion of enantiomers and epimers. Available structures reveal that those enzymes solely utilizing a 1,1&#8208;proton transfer mechanism all bind their chiral carbon acid substrate pairs in a mirror&#8208;image packing orientation with a pseudo&#8208;mirror plane defined by three groups on the stereogenic center. Typically, hydrogen atoms are positioned antipodal with respect to the pseudo&#8208;mirror plane, making a two&#8208;base mechanism imperative. This may not apply generally to epimerases and racemases using other mechanisms. For more details see the Review by S.&#8197;L. Bearne on page&#8197;10367&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: NIR Light&#8208;Induced ATRP for Synthesis of Block Copolymers Comprising UV&#8208;Absorbing Moieties</title>
      <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;ATRP protocol uses NIR radiation released by an LED at 790&#8197;nm to facilitate synthesis of block copolymers comprising UV&#8208;absorbing moieties enabling the function of an optical filter there. Cyanines with heptamethine pattern and barbiturate group favor to activate copper(II) complexes to initiate the light&#8208;induced synthesis of block copolymers with highly UV&#8208;absorbing components. Comparative experiments with UV LEDs applying a UV&#8208;based ATRP system show no initiation of living photopolymerization. Find out more in the Full Paper by B. Strehmel et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;10444&#8197;ff.

      <title>Elucidating Atropisomerism in Nonplanar Porphyrins with Tunable Supramolecular Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Atropisomerism is a fundamental feature of substituted biaryls resulting from rotation around the biaryl axis. Different stereoisomers are formed due to restricted rotation about the single bond, a situation often found in substituted porphyrins. Previously NMR determination of porphyrin atropisomers proved difficult, if not almost impossible to accomplish, due to low resolution or unresolvable resonance signals that predominantly overlapped. Here, we shed some light on this fundamental issue found in porphyrinoid stereochemistry. Using benzenesulfonic acid (BSA) for host&#8211;guest interactions and performing 1D, 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, we were able to characterize all four rotamers of the nonplanar 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18&#8208;octaethylporphyirin as restricted H&#8208;bonding complexes. Additionally, X&#8208;ray structural analysis was used to investigate aspects of the weak host&#8211;guest interactions. A detailed assignment of the chemical signals suggests charge&#8208;assisted complexation as a key to unravel the atropisomeric enigma. From a method development perspective, symmetry operations unique to porphyrin atropisomers offer an essential handle to accurately identify the rotamers using NMR techniques only.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Selective activation/functionalization of C&#8211;H bonds has emerged as an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical process at the forefront of modern synthetic chemistry.

This conceptually innovative synthetic strategy allows a facile preparation of [2.2]paracyclophane derivatives featuring disparate para&#8208;substitutions at C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;7 positions in a highly selective manner, gives access to a series of potential candidates for [2.2]para&#173;cyclo&#173;phane&#8208;derived new planar chiral ligands. The unprecedented behavior in reactivity and preferential selectivity of C&#8211;C coupling over C&#8211;N bond formation via C&#8211;H activation is unique to the [2.2]para&#173;cyclophane scaffold comparing to the non&#173;&#8208;cyclophane analogon under the same reaction conditions.

      <title>Ultrafast Charge Delocalization Dynamics of Ambient Stable CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Encapsulated in Polystyrene Fiber</title>
      <dc:description>CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) encapsulated in a transparent polystyrene (PS) fiber matrix (CsPbBr3@PS) has been synthesized to protect the NCs. The ultrafast charge delocalization dynamics of the embedded NCs has been demonstrated, and the results are compared with the pristine CsPbBr3 in toluene. Electrospinning method was employed for the preparation of CsPbBr3@PS fibers using the polystyrene solution doped with pre&#8208;synthesized CsPbBr3 and characterized by XRD, HRTEM and XPS. Energy level diagram of CsPbBr3 and PS suggest that CsPbBr3@PS fibers make a type&#8208;I core&#8208;shell structure. The carrier cooling for CsPbBr3@PS fiber is found to be much slower as compared to pure CsPbBr3 NCs. This observation suggests that photo&#8208;excited electrons from CsPbBr3 NCs get de&#8208;localized from conduction band of perovskite to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PS fiber matrix. The CsPbBr3@PS fibers possess remarkable stability under ambient condition as well as in water over months. The clear understanding of charge carrier relaxation dynamics of CsPbBr3 while confined in PS fiber could help to design robust optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

The first example of a cationic borole has been prepared. Boroles are isoelectronic to&#8212;and this example now even shares the same net charge as&#8212;the elusive cyclopentadienyl cation. Even though the charge is mainly localized in the imidazolium moiety, the formally anti&#8208;aromatic borole &#960;&#8208;system is affected. The cationic borole is more Lewis&#8208;acidic and reveals less negative reduction potentials than comparable borenium cations and even reversibly forms an isolable complex with carbon monoxide. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Heitkemper and C.&#8197;P. Sindlinger. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001916).

      <dc:description>Live&#8208;cell imaging with fluorescent probes is an essential tool in chemical biology to visualize the dynamics of biological processes in real&#8208;time. Intracellular disease biomarker imaging remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional fluorescent probes and the complex nature of cells.

Two geometric isomers of methoxylated  syn  &#8208; and  anti  &#8208;cyclohexadienylenes were synthesized, from which  9PP  was obtained via thermal aromatization in thin films.  9PP  was characterized  via  optical and infrared spectroscopy as well as atomic force microscopy and compared to polymeric analogues. Due to the lack of substitution,  para  &#8208;nonaphenylene, irrespective of the precursor isomer employed, displays pronounced aggregation in the solid state. Intermolecular electronic coupling leads to formation of H&#8208;type aggregates, red&#8208;shifting emission of the films to greenish.  9PP  allows to study the structure&#8208;property relationship of  para  &#8208;phenylene oligomers and polymers, especially since the optical properties of  PPP  depend on the molecular shape of the precursor.

      <title>Chalcogen Stabilized bis&#8208;Hydridoborate Complexes of Cobalt: Analogues of Tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane</title>
      <dc:description>Treatment of Li[BH3ER] (E = Se or Te, R = Ph; E = S, R = CH2Ph) with [Cp*CoCl]2 led to the formation of hydridoborate complexes, [{CoCp*Ph}{Cp*Co}{&#181;&#8208;EPh}{&#181;&#8208;k2&#8208;E,H&#8210;EBH3}], 1a and 1b (1a: E = Se; 1b: E = Te) and a bis&#8208;hydridoborate species [Cp*Co{&#181;&#8208;k2&#8208;Se,H&#8210;SeBH3}]2, 2. All the complexes, 1a, 1b and 2 are stabilised by &#946;&#8208;agostic type interaction in which 1b represents a novel bimetallic borate complex with a rare B&#8208;Te bond. QTAIM analysis furnished direct proof for the existence of a shared and dative B&#8208;chalcogen and Co&#8208;chalcogen interactions, respectively. In parallel to the formation of the hydridoborate complexes, the reactions also yielded tetracyclic species, [Cp*Co{&#954;3&#8208;E,H,H&#8210;E(BH2)2&#8210;C5Me5H3}], 3a and 3b (3a: E = Se and 3b: E = S), wherein the bridgehead boron atoms are surrounded by one chalcogen, one cobalt and two carbon atoms of a cyclopentane ring. Molecules 3a and 3b are best described as the structural mimic of tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane having identical structure and similar valence electron counts.</dc:description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Contributions of 2&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxyl to the Hydration of Nucleoside at Monomeric Level</title>
      <dc:description>Although many reports have revealed the structural differences between DNA and RNA at the polymeric level, there is no comparative studies with 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside and ribonucleoside to explore the roles of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group at the monomeric level under the same conditions. Inspired by these, in this work, the intrinsic contributions of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group in nucleoside have been systematically investigated by directly solving the single crystal structures of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenosine (  1  ), 2&#8208;aminoadenosine (  2  ), and 2&#8208;aminoarabinofuranosyladenine (  3  ) in water. Interestingly,  1  , which does not contain the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group, displayed strong hydration, while  2  and  3  exhibited no hydration, which is completely different to that observed in nucleic acids. Meanwhile we found that compound 1 can lock the water molecules to form unique trihydrol moieties, which further serve as the backbone to construct, to our best knowledge, the simplest double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;like structures. To this end, in order to investigate the effect of the biological environment on these unique structures, the solvent was changed from water to phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS). Surprisingly, such a subtle adjustment led to entirely different superstructures, consisting of two&#8208;dimensional lamellar structures in water and three&#8208;dimensional porous structures in PBS. These large morphological differences could be attributed to delicate ion hydration, which was also confirmed using variable temperature X&#8208;ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and intermolecular interaction energy calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning of Morphology by Chirality in Self&#8208;Assembled Structures of Bis(Urea) Amphiphiles in Water</title>
      <dc:description>We present the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of a chiral bis(urea) amphiphile and show that chirality offers a remarkable level of control towards different morphologies. Upon self&#8208;assembly in water, the molecular scale chiral information is translated to the mesoscopic level. Both enantiomers of the amphiphile self&#8208;assemble into chiral twisted ribbons with opposite handedness, as supported by Cryo&#8208;TEM and CD measurements. The system presents thermo&#8208;responsive aggregation behaviour and combined transmittance measurements, temperature dependent UV, CD, TEM and micro&#8208;DSC show that a ribbon&#8208;to&#8208;vesicles transition occurs upon heating. Remarkable, chirality allows easy control of morphology as the self&#8208;assembly into distinct aggregates can be tuned by varying the enantiomeric excess of the amphiphile, giving access to flat sheets, helical ribbons, and twisted ribbons.</dc:description>

      <title>Bioinspired Scaffolding by Supramolecular Amines Allows the Formation of One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Dimensional Silica Superstructures</title>
      <dc:description>Silica materials attract an increasing amount of interest and find applications in e.g. sensing, catalysis, and drug delivery. As the properties of silica nanomaterials not only depend on their chemistry but also their size, shape, and surface area, the controllable synthesis of silica is essential for tailoring the materials to specific applications. Advantageously, bioinspired routes for silica production are environmental&#8208;friendly and straightforward since the formation process is spontaneous and proceeds under mild conditions. These strategies mostly employ amine&#8208;bearing phosphorylated (bio)polymers. In this work, we expand this principle to supramolecular polymers based on the water&#8208;soluble cationic cyanine dye Pinacyanol acetate. Upon assembly, these dyes form large, polyaminated, supramolecular fibers. The surfaces of these fibers can be used as a scaffold for the condensation of silicic acid. Control over the ionic strength, dye concentration, and silicic acid saturation yielded silica fibers with a diameter of 25 nm and a single, 4 nm pore.&#160; Unexpectedly, other unusual superstructures, namely, nummulites and spherulites, were also found. SAXS and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy revealed ionic strength and dye concentration hardly affect the morphology of the supramolecular scaffold. TIRF unraveled that under static conditions, only silica fibers are obtained. This evidenced that the marked structural diversity originates from the shear&#8208;induced arrangement of silica/dye fibers. Under these mild conditions, external force fields have a profound influence on silica morphology.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the time scale of conformational plasticity and allostery in glycan recognition by human galectin&#8208;1.</title>
      <dc:description>The interaction of human galectin&#8208;1 with a variety of oligosaccharides, from di&#8208; (N&#8208;acetyllactosamine) to tetra&#8208;saccharides (blood B type&#8208;II antigen) has been scrutinized by using a combined approach of different NMR experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Ligand&#8208; and receptor&#8208;based NMR experiments assisted by computational methods allowed proposing three&#8208;dimensional structures for the different complexes, which explained the lack on enthalpy gain when increasing the chemical complexity of the glycan. Interestingly, and independently of the glycan ligand, the entropy term does not oppose the binding event, a rather unusual feature for protein&#8208;sugar interactions. CLEANEX&#8208;PM and relaxation dispersion experiments revealed that sugar binding affected residues far from the binding site and described significant changes in the dynamics of the protein. In particular, motions in the microsecond&#8208;millisecond timescale in residues at the protein dimer interface were identified in the presence of high affinity ligands. The dynamic process was further explored by extensive MD simulations, which provided additional support for the existence of allostery in glycan recognition by human galectin&#8208;1.</dc:description>

Conformational switching can also be triggered by changes in solvent or host&#8211;guest interactions.







Abstract
Resorcin[4]arene cavitands, equipped with diverse quinone (Q) and [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) photosensitizing walls in different configurations, were synthesized. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 420&#8197;nm, electron transfer from the [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ to the Q generates the semiquinone (SQ) radical anion, triggering a large conformational switching from a flat kite to a vase with a cavity for the encapsulation of small guests, such as cyclohexane and heteroalicyclic derivatives, in CD3CN. Depending on the molecular design, the SQ radical anion can live for several minutes (&#8776;10&#8197;min) and the vase can be generated in a secondary process without need for addition of a sacrificial electron donor to accumulate the SQ state. Switching can also be triggered by other stimuli, such as changes in solvent, host&#8211;guest complexation, and chemical and electrochemical processes. This comprehensive investigation benefits the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanodevices, such as light&#8208;activated molecular grippers.

The synthesis of new precursors for producing HOFs: systems that are capable of reversible structure reorganization are reported. A simple and convenient method is described for creation of a new class of borosiloxane compounds by combination of a very flexible siloxane framework with fragments of boric acid derivatives. Organoboron derivatives of stereoregular phenylcyclosilsesquioxanes were obtained in high yields.

Chiral N,O&#8208;acetals could be easily prepared by asymmetric hydrogenation! Construction of this family of challenging molecules has never been a easy task, until this work. Under an acidic condition, acyl salicylamides undergo cyclization to form a cationic intermediate, which could be reduced by an iridium catalyst.

      <title>Interlayer space engineering of MXenes for electrochemical energy storage applications</title>
      <dc:description>The increasing demand for high&#8208;performance rechargeable energy storage systems has stimulated the exploration of advanced electrode materials. MXenes are a class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) inorganic transition metal carbides/nitrides which are promising candidates in electrodes. The layered structure facilitates ion insertion/extraction, which offers promising electrochemical characteristics for electrochemical energy storage. However, the low capacity accompanied by sluggish electrochemical kinetics of electrodes as well as interlayer restacking and collapse significantly impede their practical applications. Recently, interlayer space engineering of MXenes via different chemical strategies have been widely investigated in designing functional materials for various applications. In this review, we provide an overview on the most recent progress of 2D MXenes engineering by intercalation, surface modification as well as heterostructures design. Moreover, some critical challenges in future research on MXene&#8208;based electrodes have been also proposed.</dc:description>

However, the low capacity accompanied by sluggish electrochemical kinetics of electrodes as well as interlayer restacking and collapse significantly impede their practical applications. Recently, interlayer space engineering of MXenes via different chemical strategies have been widely investigated in designing functional materials for various applications. In this review, we provide an overview on the most recent progress of 2D MXenes engineering by intercalation, surface modification as well as heterostructures design. Moreover, some critical challenges in future research on MXene&#8208;based electrodes have been also proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Remote Fluorination and Fluoroalkyl(thiol)ation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Remote functionalization reactions have the power to transform a C&#8211;H (or C&#8211;C) bond at a distant position from a functional group. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advances and key breakthroughs in remote fluorination, trifluoromethylation, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylthiolation, and fluoroalkenylation reactions. Several powerful strategies have emerged to control the reactivity and distal selectivity such as the undirected radical approach, the 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, the metal migration, the use of distant directing groups, and the ring&#8208;opening reactions. These unconventional and predictable C&#8211;H (and C&#8211;C) functionalization transformations should allow the preparation of a wide range of otherwise&#8208;difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access alkyl, aromatic, heteroaromatic, and structurally complex fluorides.</dc:description>

      <title>Analysis of solid&#8208;state luminescence emission amplification at substituted anthracenes by host&#8208;guest complex formation</title>
      <dc:description>Small robust organic molecules showing solid&#8208;state luminescence are promising candidates for optoelectronic materials. Herein, we investigate a series of diphenylphosphanyl anthracenes [9&#8208;PPh  2  &#8208;10&#8208;R&#8208;(C  14  H  8  )] and their sulfur oxidised analogues. The oxidation causes drastic changes in the molecular structure as the new orientation of the bulky (S)PPh  2  substituent induces a strong butterfly bent structure of the anthracene core, which triggers a strong bathochromic shift resulting in a green solid&#8208;state fluorescence. As the emission properties change only slightly upon aggregation the origin of the emission is attributed to a typical monomer fluorescence. The host&#8208;guest complexes of [9&#8208;(S)PPh  2  &#8208;10&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;(C  14  H  8  )] with four basic arenes reveal an emission enhancement up to five&#8208;times higher quantum yields compared to the pure host. Less interchromophoric interactions and a restriction of intramolecular motion within the host molecules due to fixation by weak C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions with the co&#8208;crystallised arene are responsible for that emission enhancement.</dc:description>

      <title>Doubly Boron&#8208;doped TADF Emitters Decorated with ortho&#8208;Donor Groups for Highly Efficient Green to Red OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>Doubly boron&#8208;doped thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on a 9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene (DBA) acceptor decorated with  ortho  &#8208;donor groups (Cz2  o  DBA,  2  ; BuCz2  o  DBA,  3  ; DMAC2  o  DBA,  4  ) are prepared to realize high&#8208;efficiency green&#8208;to&#8208;red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of  2  and  4  reveal the symmetrical and highly twisted  ortho  &#8208;donor&#8722;acceptor&#8722;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) structure of the emitters. The twisted conformation leads to a very small energy splitting (&#916;  E  ST  &lt; 0.08 eV) between the excited singlet and triplet states that gives rise to strong TADF, as supported by theoretical studies. Depending on the strength of the donor moieties, the emission color is fine&#8208;tuned in the visible region from green (  2  ) to yellow (  3  ) to red (  4  ). Carbazole&#8208;containing  2  and  3  exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) approaching 100%, whereas DMAC&#8208;substituted  4  is moderately emissive (PLQY = 44%) in a doped host film. Highly efficient green&#8208;to&#8208;red TADF&#8208;OLEDs are realized with the proposed  ortho  &#8208;D&#8722;A&#8722;D compounds as emitters. The green and yellow OLEDs incorporating Cz2  o  DBA (  2  ) and BuCz2  o  DBA (  3  ) emitters exhibit high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26.6% and 21.6%, respectively. In particular, the green device shows an excellent power efficiency above 100 lm W  &#8722;1  . A red OLED fabricated with a DMAC2  o  DBA (  4  ) emitter exhibits a maximum EQE of 10.1% with an electroluminescence peak at 615 nm.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the high performance anode material of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O microrods wrapped by reduced graphene oxide for lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi&#8208;step solvo/hydro&#8208;thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4&#183;2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O. The CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 and has superior long&#8208;cycle stability.

The phenol functionality was protected as the acetate. The esters were then reacted with PhI(OAc)  2  and the resulting isomers separated kinetically (for derivatives of anion  A  ) or by chromatography (for derivatives of anion  B  ) giving the difunctionalized building blocks in overall yields of 9% and 50%, respectively. A similar series of reactions was performed starting with anions  A  and  B  and 4&#8208;methoxystyryl bromide and iodide. Significant differences in the reactivity of derivatives of the two carborane anions were rationalized with DFT computational results. Application of the difunctionalized carboranes as building blocks was demonstrated through preparation of two ionic liquid crystals. The extensive synthetic work is accompanied by single crystal XRD analysis of six derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions and their application in SF6&#160;activation</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of the strong monophosphazene base with the weakly acidic phenol leads to the formation of a phenol&#8208;phenolate anion with a moderately strong hydrogen bond. Application of the more powerful tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) renders the isolation of the corresponding salt with a free phenolate anion possible.

The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with tetraphosphazene bases represents a great way for the clean preparation of salts featuring free phenolate anions and in addition allows the selective syntheses of hydrogen bonded phenol&#8208;phenolate salts.

      <title>Multiple Disentangling Effects on Excited State Intramolecular Charge Transfer Among Asymmetrical Tripartite PPI&#8208;TPA/PCz Triads</title>
      <dc:description>B   y   utilizing the bipolarity of 1,2&#8208;diphenylphenanthroimidazole (PPI), two types of asymmetrical tripartite triads (PPI&#8208;TPA and PPI&#8208;PCz) have been designed with triphenylamine (TPA) and 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;   carbazole  (PCz), respectively. These triads are the deep&#8208;blue luminescent materials with a high fluorescence quantum yield of nearly 100%.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;B   y   utilizing the bipolarity of 1,2&#8208;diphenylphenanthroimidazole (PPI), two types of asymmetrical tripartite triads (PPI&#8208;TPA and PPI&#8208;PCz) have been designed with triphenylamine (TPA) and 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;   carbazole  (PCz), respectively. These triads are the deep&#8208;blue luminescent materials with a high fluorescence quantum yield of nearly 100%.  To trace the photophysical behaviors of  these novel triads,  the excited states evolution channels  and interchromophoric interactions of these triads were investigated by ultrafast time&#8208;resolved transient absorption and excited states theoretical calculations. The results suggest that the electronic nature of moieties, asymmetrical tripartite structure and the distance of electron&#8208;hole of these triads as well as the polarity of solvent determine the lifetime of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).

      <title>On&#8208;demand Hydrophobic Drug Release Based on Microwaveresponsive

Graphene Hydrogel Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>Electromagnetically driven drug delivery systems stand out among stimulus&#8208;responsive materials due to their ability to release cargo on demand by remote stimulation, such as light, near infrared (NIR) or microwave (MW) radiation. MW&#8208;responsive soft materials, such as hydrogels, generally operate at 2.45 GHz frequencies, which usually involves rapid overheating of the scaffold and may affect tissue surrounding the target location. In contrast, 915 MHz MW penetrate deeper tissues and are less prone to induce rapid overheating. In order to circumvent these limitations, we present here for the first time a graphene&#8208;based hydrogel that is responsive to MW irradiation of &#957; = 915 MHz. This system is a candidate soft scaffold to deliver a model hydrophobic drug. The graphene present in the hydrogel acts as a heat&#8208;sink and avoids overheating of the scaffold upon MW irradiation. In addition, the microwave trigger stimulates the  in vitro  delivery of the model drug, thus suggesting a remote and deep&#8208;penetrating means to deliver a drug from a delivery reservoir. Moreover, the MW&#8208;triggered release of drug was observed to be enhanced under acidic conditions, where the swelling state is maximum due to the swelling&#8208;induced pH&#8208;responsiveness of the hydrogel. The hybrid composite described here is a harmless means to deliver remotely a hydrophobic drug on demand with a MW source of 915 MHz.  Potential uses in biomedical applications were evaluated by cytotoxicity tests.</dc:description>

      <title>Nucleation of Tiny Silver Nanoparticles Using a Tetrafacial Organic Molecular Barrel for Potential Use in Visible Light Triggered Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of discrete molecular architectures of diverse shapes and sizes is well studied in last three decades. Use of dynamic imine bond for designing analogous metal&#8208;free architectures is a growing challenge in recent time. This article reports an organic molecular barrel (OB4R) as a potential template for nucleation and stabilization of very tiny (&lt; 1.5 nm) Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs). Imine bond condensation of a rigid tetra&#8208;aldehyde with a flexible diamine followed by imine&#8208;bond reduction yielded the discrete tetragonal organic barrel (OB4R). Presence of molecular pocket ornamented with eight diamine moieties is potential for encapsulation of silver(I). The organic barrel was finally used as a molecular vessel for the controlled nucleation of AgNPs with fine size tuning via binding of Ag(I) ions in the confined space of barrel followed by reduction. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis of the Ag(0)@OB4R composite revealed that the mean particle size is 1.44&#177;0.16 nm. The composite material has ~52 wt% silver loading. The barrel supported ultrafine AgNPs [Ag(0)@OB4R] are found to be efficient photocatalyst for facile Ullmann&#8208;type aryl&#8208;amination coupling of haloarenes at ambient temperature without using any additives. The catalyst was stable for several cycles of reuse without any agglomeration. The new composite Ag(0)@OB4R represents the first example of discrete organic&#8208;barrel supported AgNPs employed as photocatalyst in Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reaction at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring a Dress to Single Protein Molecules: Proteins Can Do It Themselves through Localized Photo&#8208;Polymerization and Molecular Imprinting.</title>
      <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MIP NPs) are antibody&#8208;like recognition materials prepared by a template assisted synthesis. MIP NPs able to target biomolecules, like proteins, are under the spotlight for their great potential in medicine, but using the molecular imprinting technique with biological macromolecular templates efficiently is still very challenging. Here we propose generating a molecular imprint in single NPs, by photochemically initiating the polymerization from individual protein templates. In this way, each protein molecule somehow tailors itself its own 'polymeric dress'. For this, the template protein is covalently coupled with a photoinitiator, Eosin Y. Irradiated with light at 533 nm, the Eosin moiety acts as an antenna and transfers energy to a co&#8208;initiator (an amine), which generates a radical and initiates polymerization. As a result, a polymer network is forming only around the very template molecule, producing cross&#8208;linked NPs of 50 nm, with single binding sites showing high affinity (K D 10 &#8208;9 M) for their biological target, and selectivity over other proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral Catalysts for Pd0&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>In the past decades, processes that involve transition&#8208;metal catalysis have represented a major part of synthetic tools. Recently, the interest shifted from the well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling reactions to C&#8211;H bond functionalization, thus making it a current frontier of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Constant progress in this field has led to the discovery of enantioselective methods to generate and control various types of stereogenic elements, thereby demonstrating its high value to generate scalemic chiral molecules. The present review is dedicated to enantioselective Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation, which may be considered as an evolution of Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, with a focus on the different chiral ligands and catalysts that enable these transformations.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the past decades, processes that involve transition&#8208;metal catalysis have represented a major part of synthetic tools. Recently, the interest shifted from the well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling reactions to C&#8211;H bond functionalization, thus making it a current frontier of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Constant progress in this field has led to the discovery of enantioselective methods to generate and control various types of stereogenic elements, thereby demonstrating its high value to generate scalemic chiral molecules. The present review is dedicated to enantioselective Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation, which may be considered as an evolution of Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, with a focus on the different chiral ligands and catalysts that enable these transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

More importantly, it also possesses excellent cycle stability to maintain 80.6% capacitance after 5000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device utilizing Mn0.1&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/NF as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode attains a high energy density of 39.6 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 143.8 W kg&#8208;1 power density with a capacitance retention of 83.6% after 5000 cycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrolysis of Peptide Bonds in Protein Micelles Promoted by a Zirconium(IV)&#8208;Substituted Polyoxometalate as an Artificial Protease</title>
      <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of hydrophobic and unstructured proteins is difficult due to their poor solubility in aqueous solutions. This study demonstrates the ability of ZrIV&#8208;substituted Keggin polyoxometalate (Et2NH2)10[Zr(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] to promote selective hydrolysis of &#946;&#8208;casein, an intrinsically unstructured protein consisting of 209 amino acids. The amphipathic nature of &#946;&#8208;casein causes it to assemble into large micelles, in which the hydrophilic part of the protein is solvent exposed and able to interact with Zr&#8208;POM that activates peptide bonds towards hydrolysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;N. Parac&#8208;Vogt et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001920).

Eight pendant boranes are better than one for the activation of Lewis bases. A new diphosphine ligand that features four pendant borane groups has been prepared. The coordination chemistry of this new scaffold has been established using nickel&#8212;giving an octaboraneyl Ni0 complex; this species reacts readily with Lewis bases such as 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

      <title>The Missing Link in the Magnetism of Hybrid Cobalt Layered Hydroxides: The Odd&#8208;Even Effect of the Organic Spacer</title>
      <dc:description>A dramatic change in the magnetic behaviour that solely depends on the parity of the organic linker molecules has been found in a family of layered Co II hydroxides covalently functionalized with dicarboxylic molecules.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A dramatic change in the magnetic behaviour that solely depends on the parity of the organic linker molecules has been found in a family of layered Co II hydroxides covalently functionalized with dicarboxylic molecules. These layered hybrid materials have been synthesized at room temperature in one pot procedure through the &#8220;Epoxide Route&#8221;. While hybrids connected by odd alkyl chains exhibit coercive fields (H c ) below ca. 3500 Oe and show spontaneous magnetization at temperatures (T M ) below 20 K, hybrids functionalized with even alkyl chains behave as hard magnets with H c &amp;gt; 5500 Oe and display T M higher than 55 K. This intriguing behaviour was studied by density functional theory with the incorporation of a Hubbard term (DFT+U) calculations, unveiling the structural subtleties underlying this observation. Indeed, the different molecular orientation exhibited by the even/odd alkyl chains, and the orientation of the covalently linked carboxylic groups modify the intensity of the magnetic coupling of both octahedral and tetrahedral in&#8208;plane sublattices, thus strongly affecting the magnetic properties of the hybrid.

      <title>Control of Axial Chirality by Planar Chirality Based on Optically Active [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>Optically active X&#8208;shaped molecules based on the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane building block were prepared, in which di(methoxy)terphenyl units were stacked on the central benzene rings. At 25 &#176;C, anisolyl rings freely rotate in solution, while in the crystal form, they are fixed by intramolecular CH&#8208;&#960; interactions, thereby leading to the expression of the axial chirality, i.e., propeller chirality was exhibited by the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane moiety. The X&#8208;shaped molecule exhibited good circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) profiles with moderate  &#934;  PL  and a large  g  lum  value in the order of 10  &#8211;3  at 25 &#176;C, in solution. In contrast, at &#8211;120 &#176;C, dual CPL emission with opposite signs was observed. According to the theoretical studies, the rotary motion of the anisolyl units is suppressed in the excited states, and so emission from two isomers could be observed. These results demonstrate that the axial chirality was controlled by the planar chirality, leading ultimately to propeller chirality.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational design of a&#160; Zn(II)&#8208;MOF with multiple functional sites for highly efficient fixation of CO2 at mild conditions: A combined experimental and theoretical investigation</title>
      <dc:description>The development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts suitable for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) under mild conditions is a promising step towards mitigating the growing concentration of CO2&#160;in the atmosphere. Consequently, herein we report construction of a novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded 3D framework, {[Zn(hfipbba)(MA)].3DMF}n (HbMOF1) by utilizing Zn(II) center, a partially fluorinated, long&#8208;chain dicarboxylate ligand (hfipbba) and an amine&#8208;rich melamine (MA) co&#8208;ligand. Interestingly, the framework possesses two types of 1D channels decorated with CO2&#160;&#8208;philic (&#8208;NH2&#160;and &#8208;CF3) groups promoting highly selective CO2&#160;adsorption properties to the framework&#160;which was further supported by&#160;the computational simulations.&#160;Further, the synergistic involvement of both Lewis acidic and basic sites exposed in the confined 1D pores along with high thermal and chemical stability rendered HbMOF1&#160;an ideal heterogeneous catalyst for highly efficient fixation of CO2&#160;with terminal/internal epoxides at mild conditions of RT and 1 bar CO2. Moreover, in&#8208;depth theoretical studies were carried out by periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) to obtain the relative energy for each stage involved in the catalytic&#160;reaction and an insight mechanistic details of the&#160;reaction is presented.

      <title>Control of intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer in deoxyadenosine&#8208;based fluorescent probes</title>
      <dc:description>In this paper, we report on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer ( PET) reaction between a donor (adenine analog) and an acceptor (3&#8208;methoxychromone dye,  3MC  ) in the context of designing efficient fluorescent probes as DNA sensors. Firstly, Gibbs energy was investigated in disconnected donor&#8208;acceptor systems by Rehm&#8208;Weller equation. The oxidation potential of the adenine derivative was responsible for exergonicity of the PET reaction in separated combinations. Then, the PET reaction in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugates was investigated using steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, acid&#8208;mediated PET inhibition and transient absorption techniques. In conjugated systems, PET is a favorable pathway of fluorescent quenching when an electron&#8208;rich adenine analog (  d7A  ) was connected to the fluorophore (  3MC  ). We found that formation of ground&#8208;state complexes even at nM concentration range dominated the dye photophysics and generated poorly emissive species likely through intermolecular PET from  d7A  to  3MC  . On the other hand, solution acidification disrupts complexation and turns on the dye emission. Bridging an electron&#8208;poor adenine analog with high oxidation potential (  8d7A  ) to  3MC  presenting low reduction potential is another alternative to prevent complex formation and produce highly emissive monomer conjugates.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynameric Collagen Self&#8208;healing Membranes with High Mechanical Strength for Effective Cell Grow Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The fabrication of biocompatible adaptive materials with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties for medical applications is a challenging endeavor. Collagen is a major&#160;extracellular matrix component acting as a substrate for cell adhesion and migration. Dynamers are constitutional polymers whose monomeric components are linked through reversible bonds, able to modify their constitution via reversible exchange of their components. In the current work, we demonstrate that the rational combination of collagen and dynameric networks connected with reversible covalent imine bonds is a very important and previously unreported strategy to provide biocompatible membranes with self&#8208;healing ability and excellent mechanical strength. The key challenge in the construction of such membranes is the interaction between collagen and the cross&#8208;linkers, preventing the formation of defects. For example, by varying structure and molecular lengths of the dynamers, the tensile strength of the dynameric membranes reach over 80 MPa, more than 400% higher than that observed of the reference collagen membrane and the highest value for break strain was recorded 19%. The self&#8208;healing property was observed when reconnecting two membrane pieces or even from crushed status of the membranes. Moreover, both MTT assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy method demonstrated the good biocompatibility of the collagen membranes, leaving more than 90% viability for NIH 3T3 cells after 24 h co&#8208;culture.</dc:description>

      <title>An assay for screening potential drug candidates for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease that act as chaperones of the Transthyretin&#160;and Amyloid&#8208;&#223;&#160;peptides interaction</title>
      <dc:description>The protein transthyretin (TTR) modulates Abeta (A&#946;) peptides deposition and processing and this physiological effect is further enhanced by treatment with iododiflunisal (IDIF), a small&#8208;molecule compound (SMC) with TTR tetramer stabilization properties that behaves as chaperone of the complex. This knowledge has prompted us to design and optimize a rapid and simple high&#8208;throughput assay that relies on the ability of test compounds to form ternary soluble complexes TTR/A&#946;/SMC that prevent A&#946; aggregation. The method uses the shorter A&#946;(12&#8208;28) sequence which is cheaper and simpler to use while retaining the aggregation properties of their parents A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and&#160; A&#946;(1&#8208;42). The test is carried out in 96&#8208;plate wells that are UV monitored for turbidity during 6 h. Given its reproducibility, we propose that this test can be a powerful tool for efficient screening of SMCs that act as chaperones of the TTR/A&#946; interaction that may led to potential AD therapies.</dc:description>

      <title>Enabling Control over Mechanical Conformity and Luminescence in Molecular Crystals: Interaction Engineering in Action</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular crystals of&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are of great interest as the highly ordered dense packing offers superior charge and exciton transport. However, integration into optoelectronic devices remains a major challenge due to its inherent brittle nature. Herein, we report the control over mechanical conformity in the single crystals of pyridine appended thiazolothizaole derivative by modulating the molecular packing through interaction engineering. Two polymorphs were prepared by achieving control over the thermodynamic/kinetic factors of crystallization, one of the polymorphs exhibits elastic bending while the other is brittle. The control over the bending ability was achieved by forming co&#8208;crystals with hydrogen/halogen bond donors. A seamless extended criss&#8208;cross pattern with respect to the bend plane through ditopic H&#8208;bonding motif showed the highest compliance towards elastic bending, while the co&#8208;crystals with a layered criss&#8208;cross arrangement with the segregated layers of co&#8208;formers exhibit slightly lower bending conformity. Our results update the rationale behind the plastic/elastic bending in molecular crystals. The co&#8208;crystals of ditopic halogen bond co&#8208;crystals are particularly appealing for waveguiding applications as the co&#8208;crystals blends high mechanical flexibility and luminescence properties. The hydrogen bond co&#8208;crystals are non emissive in nature due to excited state proton transfer dynamics. The rationale behind the fluorescence properties of these materials were also established from DFT calculations in a QM:MM framework.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective alkynylation of isatins: A combination of metal catalysis and organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>We have developed efficient and catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of isatins using a bifunctional amidophosphine&#8211;urea/AgBF  4  complex as the catalyst. By a combination of metal catalysis and organocatalysis, excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99%  ee  ) and good yields are achieved. A wide range of both terminal alkynes and isatins are tolerated by this new catalyst system, providing access to structurally diverse propargylic alcohols with tetrasubstituted stereogenic centers in high efficiency.</dc:description>
