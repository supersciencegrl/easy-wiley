         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescent Responsive Bilayer Architecture Based on 2D Lanthanide MOFs for Ratiometric NO2 and SO2 Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report two novel Lanthanide Coordination Polymers, [Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (1) and [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (2), with enhanced luminescence. These MOFs were then embedded in PDMS to create a bilayer configuration. We implemented a novel ratiometric approach to achieve highly accurate SO2 detection. 2 serves as an internal reference while 1 act as the SO2&#8208;sensitive component offering high sensitivity, specificity, and a pioneer application of a bilayer system.








Abstract
The development of responsive materials for monitoring atmospheric toxic emissions is a growing area of interest. Luminescent metal&#8208;organic framework (LMOF), particularly those based on lanthanides (LnMOFs), have emerged as promising candidates due to their sharp emission bands, long luminescence lifetimes, and structural versatility. Despite their potential, the integration of LnMOFs into robust solid&#8208;state sensing platforms remains limited. In this study, we report the synthesis of three isostructural LnMOFs &#8208;[Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Gd2(AATA)3(DMF)4]&#8208; based on the antenna&#8208;type ligand 2,5&#8208;bis(acetylamido)terephthalic acid, which promotes strong lanthanide emission and stable 2D frameworks. The MOFs were successfully embedded into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to produce composite films retaining their luminescent properties in the solid state. We further present a conceptual bilayer configuration with one film acting as a stable internal reference, and the other serving as the analyte&#8208;responsive layer. This bilayer design enables ratiometric luminescence detection, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the measurements. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that the bilayer films exhibit measurable luminescence changes in presence of two major atmospheric pollutants, NO2 and SO2. This result sets a foundational approach for developing more accurate and self&#8208;referencing luminescent materials.

         <title>Metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based Conductive Frameworks as Working Electrode for Dehydrogenase&#8208;Like Electrochemical Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of polymetallophthalocyanines as working electrode achieves dehydrogenase&#8208;like electrochemical oxidation of thioethers with excellent Faradaic efficiency over 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution to sulfoxides, along with a high conversion rate of 0.238 mmol&#160;h&#8722;1, outperforming carbon paper electrodes.








Abstract
The selection of electrode materials is critical to the reactivity and selectivity for organic electrosynthesis. In this work, we for the first time use polymetallophthalocyanines (pMPcs) as working electrode for the efficient and highly selective oxidation of sulfide. pMPcs was found to be able to mediate sulfide oxidation with dehydrogenase&#8208;like activity, in which water acts as an oxygen source, for a broad substrate scope, including pharmaceuticals. Among the pMPcs electrodes, pFePc exhibits the highest catalytic selectivity with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, as well as the highest conversion rate of 0.238&#160;mmol h&#8722;1. Studies combining spectroscopic experiments and computational approaches reveal that the mechanism of oxidation of sulfide involves the proton&#8208;coupled oxidation of Fe&#9472;OH2 to generate Fe&#9552;O intermediates on the metal atom of the metal&#8208;N4 units of pMPcs. This work highlights the potential for the application of conductive framework materials in organic&#8208;electrical synthesis.

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here nitroreductase&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligations have been demonstrated, enabled by nitrobenzyl caged dihydrotetrazines. By tagging a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable tetrazine precursor with an integrin&#8208;specific peptide c(RGDyK), a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation has been achieved in the presence of hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Prodrugs in response to tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed Nitroreductase (NTR) among hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through &#8220;click&#8208;to&#8208;release&#8221; reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoids with Two Different Binding Sites for Strong ATP Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP is key for activating enzymes associated with cancer. A potential therapeutic approach is strong binding of ATP, making it unavailable to enzymes. The water&#8208;soluble peptoid P1&#8208;TB incorporates two synergistic binding sites for ATP: terpyridine&#8208;Zn&#178;&#8314; and 4&#8208;CPBA that bind ATP's phosphate and diol groups, respectively, and exhibits an exceptional K&#7429;&#8208;ATP of 7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, representing a potential ATP chelator.








Abstract
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the activator of many enzymes, including kinases, that play a significant role in various medical conditions such as cancer. Therefore, inhibiting ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes requires to disable its binding to enzymes, and this can be done by developing potent ATP chelators. Currently, there are two main types of chelators: one that binds ATP via zinc complexes of nitrogen&#8208;based ligands, such as 2,2&#8242;;6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (Terpy), which target&#160;the phosphate ligands, and another one containing phenylboronic acid (PBA) to bind the diols within the ribose. Herein, we report on a unique chelation approach that combines these two binding strategies in one scaffold; we use peptidomimetic oligomers called peptoids that incorporate both Zn(Terpy) and PBA as strong, water&#8208;soluble ATP binding inhibitors. These peptoids demonstrated high affinity to ATP, where the highest is KD&#8208;ATP&#160;=&#160;7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, four times higher than the binding affinity of peptoids targeting only phosphates or only diols, and at least two orders of magnitude higher than known ATP chelators. Structural studies indicated that positioning both Terpy and PBA side chains close together on the scaffold increased ATP binding affinity, compared to spacing them apart.

         <title>Front Cover: Study on Phosphorus Compound/Catechol&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amidation and Its Database Development for Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol derivatives substantially enhanced the catalytic activity of phosphorus&#8208;based compounds in the direct amidation of carboxylic acids with amines. The synergy between the phosphorus and catechol derivatives was analyzed by machine learning, enabling the catalytic efficiency to be predicted and the key factors that determine the reaction yield to be visualized. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Noto, S. Saito and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500955).

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature depicts how dyes navigate over energy surfaces, surfing on the waves of their excited state before falling back in a splash of light, turning into glowing drinks and shiny crystals. The surface plots from the computational studies transformed into waves, an umbrella, sand and a kite when the scientific mind wanders about the beach on holiday. Children and dogs playing in the sand remind us to keep a joyful curiosity about our surroundings, to find gemstones into our summer drinks. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Guieu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501178).

The marine alkaloid 2,2&#8208;bis(6&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;indolyl)ethanamine, isolated from the Californian tunicate Didemnum candidum, exhibits activity against Leishmania infantum but suffers from significant toxicity. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500637), S. Lucarini and co&#8208;workers report the development of a robust, rapid, and efficient Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling protocol for this class of NH&#8322;&#8208;unprotected bromobisindole ethanamines. This method enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of the bisindole scaffold with a broad range of boronic acids, generating more&#8208;selective leads against Leishmania.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Photocatalysts for Sustainable Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Peroxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production via COFs represents a sustainable approach to addressing energy and environmental challenges. This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation using COFs, focusing on rational material design strategies and fundamental mechanisms. By combining photochemical principles with tailored COF design, this approach offers a sustainable route for solar&#8208;powered H&#8322;O&#8322; production.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a pivotal role in energy and environmental applications, but its industrial synthesis remains hampered by high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and safety risks. Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable alternative by leveraging solar energy to catalyze H2O2 production from oxygen and water. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their well&#8208;defined structures and customizable active sites, enabling efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC). This review comprehensively explores recent progress in COF&#8208;mediated photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. It begins with an overview of photocatalytic principles, followed by a detailed analysis of reaction mechanisms and performance metrics for H2O2 generation. Emphasis is placed on tailored COF design strategies&#8212;such as electronic structure optimization and redox&#8208;active site engineering&#8212;to improve catalytic efficiency. Finally, we identify key challenges hindering the development of high&#8208;performance COFs photocatalysts tailored for sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; synthesis.

         <title>The Versatility of Diazirines: Properties, Synthetic and Modern Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazirines are 3&#8208;membered heterocycles containing two nitrogen atoms connected by a double bond. They possess a multi&#8208;faceted reactivity that holds great potential for organic synthesis. This review discusses their properties, modes of activation, and their many modern uses, underlining their underappreciated versatility: as carbene precursors, but also as electrophilic nitrogen donors, as NMR hyperpolarization probes, or as molecular tools in materials science.








Abstract
Diazirines are 3&#8208;membered heterocycles containing two nitrogen atoms connected by a double bond. They are mostly known for their usage in photoaffinity labeling (PAL), due to their stability and their facile photolysis for on&#8208;demand carbene generation. Yet diazirines possess a multi&#8208;faceted reactivity that also holds great potential for organic synthesis. This is illustrated in the present review, which is meant to be a beginner's guide for new diazirine users. After briefly summarizing the main synthetic approaches to these derivatives (with a focus on recent improvements), we emphasize some of their most critical features and properties before describing the various modes of activation toward carbene generation, some of which were only uncovered in the past decade. We then review the many modern uses of diazirines, underlining their underappreciated versatility: as carbene precursors in synthesis, but also as electrophilic nitrogen donors, as NMR hyperpolarization probes, or as molecular tools in materials science.

Fe&#8208;TAML in the presence of hydrogen peroxide efficiently catalyzes the oxidative degradation of naphthalene in aqueous medium of neutral pH. Products are identified and key mechanistic features are discussed.








Abstract
The electron transfer from naphthalene at an oxidized iron TAML species (TAML&#160;=&#160;tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) is a key step of its environmentally relevant deep degradation by hydrogen peroxide in water leading first to naphthoquinones which are further converted to smaller fragments. Other polycyclic arenes are also oxidized, often faster than naphthalene consistent with their lower ionization potentials than that of naphthalene.

         <title>Efficient and Rapid Arylation of NH&#8322;&#8208;Unprotected Bromobisindole Ethanamines via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling: Generating New Leads Against Leishmania</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of novel bisindole derivatives was synthesized through an optimized rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindole ethanamines and boronic acids with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against L. infantum promastigotes. In particular, bisindole 3af demonstrated potent antileishmanial activity with a higher selectivity index compared to the reference drug miltefosine.








Abstract
Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which presents significant global health challenges due to the lack of effective vaccines and the limitations of existing chemotherapeutics in view of their toxicity, resistance, and high costs. In this study, we realized a library of novel bisindole derivatives as potential antileishmanial agents through a rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindole ethanamines and boronic acids. Optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the efficient and selective arylation of these substrates, with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against Leishmania infantum promastigotes. Among the tested bisindole derivatives, 3af (bearing a 4&#8208;vinylphenyl moiety) demonstrated potent antileishmanial activity (IC50 = 1.1 &#181;M) with a higher selectivity index (21.8) compared to the reference drug miltefosine (9.8). A significant activity was also retained against intracellular amastigotes. This study establishes a robust methodology for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bisindoles, also highlighting these derivatives' potential as promising leads for antileishmanial drug development.

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed an electrochemical hydroxynitration or chloronitration bifunctionalization reaction of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond by using sodium nitrite as a nitro source, and a series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was produced in good to excellent yields.








Abstract
We herein developed a novel method for generating nitryl free radicals using sodium nitrite for the first time under electrocatalytic conditions. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features a simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes and shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.

         <title>Study on Phosphorus Compound/Catechol&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amidation and Its Database Development for Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorus&#8208;based catalytic system for the direct amidation of carboxylic acids with amines has been developed. The efficiency of the phosphorus catalysis is substantially enhanced using catechol derivatives as additives. A vault of experimental data obtained this time was complemented with ML models, which allowed capturing the intricate catalytic behavior in the amidation system.








Abstract
Herein, we report that the catalytic activity of phosphorus compounds with a P&#9472;H bond in dehydrative amidation reactions is substantially enhanced when using catechol derivatives as additives. A systematic investigation into the catalytic activity of four phosphorus compounds and 17 catechol derivatives allowed identifying several effective combinations, for example, dimethyl phosphite and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene, for the catalytic amidation of carboxylic acids with amines. The developed catalytic system enables the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and facilitates the amidation of anilines, which are typically considered poor substrates with low reactivity. In addition, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were constructed to validate the effectiveness of the database generated from the above&#8208;mentioned investigation. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) models incorporating descriptors derived from both quantum chemical calculations and RDKit provided accurate predictions while maintaining chemical interpretability, which was underscored by a visual analysis using SHAP.

It was revealed that the sign of &#947; reverses and their absolute values become large near the charge localization boundary.








Abstract
Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valence systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#8226;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant variation&#160;of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Fluorophore with Enhanced Emission: Insights into Photophysical Properties through Proton Transfer Mapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, presenting an ESIPT, exhibits also a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence intensity. The modelization of the energy landscapes, combining proton transfer or deprotonation with rotations of substituents, demonstrates the existence of nonemissive conformations and rationalizes the experimental emission properties.








Abstract
A comprehensive study of a single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, characterized by a low molecular weight and a significant Stokes&#8217; shift, is reported. The fluorophore exhibits crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of nonemissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state and rationalized the large Stokes&#8217; shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photosensitizer&#8208;free three&#8208;component acylpyridylation of styrenes is presented. In this strategy, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones play a triple role: they act as visible&#8208;light&#8208;activated photosensitizers, acylation reagents, and reductants. This approach does not require transition&#8208;metals, external photosensitizers, or reductive reagent, demonstrating high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, and robust tolerance to various functional groups.

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers With Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>

1D CPs are promising materials for the adsorption of VOCs. Solid&#8208;state NMR was applied to characterize host&#8208;guest interactions and dynamics of chlorobenzene in two CPs with different topologies. While ligand dynamics were similar in both CPs, chlorobenzene was found to undergo more restricted dynamics in the CP with polycatenated topology because of the smaller free volume and stronger interactions.








Abstract
1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as a metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on&#8208;resonance 1H free induction decays (FIDs), 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated with the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.

A porous monolithic composite CS@COF was synthesized by the in situ growth of covalent organic framework (COF) on the CS surface. It achieved 98% removal of triglycerides and high recovery of 190 chemical hazards from fat&#8208;rich food, providing an efficient and cost&#8208;effective solution for sample pretreatment in food non&#8208;targeted analysis.









Abstract
In the food safety non&#8208;targeted analysis, it is urgent to develop suitable adsorbent materials for sample pretreatment, so as to achieve efficient removal of interference matrices in food samples and &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of potential chemical hazards. Traditional adsorption materials exhibit limitations such as poor removal efficiency and high cost. To address these issues, this study presents the preparation of a hierarchically porous monolithic corn straw@COF (CS@COF) composite for efficient sample pretreatment of fat&#8208;rich foods. CS@COF combines the advantages of corn straw (CS) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), offering a high specific surface area and porosity. CS serves as a carrier for in&#8208;situ growth of COF, resulting in a material with easy operation and low cost. CS@COF demonstrates strong adsorption capacity, effectively removing over 98% of triglycerides within 8 minutes from fat&#8208;rich food samples like soybean. Moreover, it achieves &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of 190 chemical hazards with 89% recoveries within the ideal range. The reusability of CS@COF for 5 cycles after elution further underscores its practicality. This innovative CS@COF composite shows great potential in sample pretreatment for non&#8208;targeted food safety analysis, providing a cost&#8208;effective and efficient solution.

This innovative CS@COF composite shows great potential in sample pretreatment for non-targeted food safety analysis, providing a cost-effective and efficient solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cathepsin L&#8208;Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Resistant Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an urgent need for non&#8208;invasive tools capable of real&#8208;time, in situ tracking of drug&#8208;resistant cell populations. Cathepsin L (CTSL), a cysteine protease overexpressed in aggressive malignancies, presents such an opportunity. This work designs a CTSL&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe by synergizes a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (FR) with a fluorophore (DCO), tailored for imaging drug&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells. FR&#8208;DCO can achieve fluorescence enhancement upon CTSL activation, distinguishes MCF&#8208;7/ADR from non&#8208;resistant cells and visualizes resistant tumors in vivo with 2&#8208;fold higher signal intensity than controls.








Abstract
Precise identification of drug&#8208;resistant tumor cells remains a critical challenge for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Herein, we present FR&#8208;DCO, a cathepsin L (CTSL)&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe, engineered for targeted imaging of doxorubicin&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells (MCF&#8208;7/ADR). Capitalizing on the overexpression of CTSL in chemoresistant malignancies, FR&#8208;DCO integrates a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (Phe&#8208;Arg, FR) with a dicyanoisophorone (DCO) fluorophore, enabling fluorescence activation via a single&#8208;step enzymatic cleavage. Upon hydrolysis, FR&#8208;DCO transitions from an intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;quenched state to an activated DCO fluorophore, achieving a 12.8&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield. In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis in MCF&#8208;7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensity than its nonresistant counterparts (MCF&#8208;7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug&#8208;resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of nonresistant lesions within 20&#160;minutes post&#8208;injection. Notably, dual&#8208;tumor xenograft models confirmed precise discrimination of MCF&#8208;7/ADR tumors from 4T1 tumors, highlighting the spatial resolution of the probe. This work not only provides a molecular tool for spatiotemporal resistance monitoring, but also establishes a modular design paradigm for enzyme&#8208;responsive probes targeting tumor microenvironment biomarkers, advancing precision oncology strategies.

         <title>The Nature and Stability of Transition Metal&#8208;Anchored Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our quantum chemical analyses of the bonding trends between period 4 transition metals and nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support reveal that the metal&#8211;support interaction strengthens from Ti to Ni, then weakens from Ni to Zn. This trend arises from changes in bonding interaction between the transition metals&#8217; 3dxy orbital and nitrogen lone pairs of the graphene support.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent an emerging class of catalysts that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To prevent demetallation and ensure catalyst stability, sufficiently strong bonds between the transition metal and the support are essential. We have quantum chemically analyzed the trend in bonding interaction between period 4 transition metals (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and the four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support. We find that the metal&#8211;support interactions strengthen from Ti to Ni but weaken from Ni to Zn. Activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital (KS&#8208;MO) analyses reveal that this trend stems from changes in the interaction between the metal's 3dxy atomic orbital and the nitrogen lone pair orbitals of the support. As we move along period 4, the bonding mechanism changes from an increasingly more stabilizing HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti&#8208;Ni), due to the higher effective nuclear charge of the metal, to a less favorable HOMO&#8211;SOMO (TM&#160;=&#160;Cu) and unfavorable HOMO&#8211;HOMO (TM&#160;=&#160;Zn) interaction, as a result of the filling of the metal's 3dxy atomic orbital. This results in the observed strengthening, followed by weakening, of the metal&#8211;support interaction. These insights could guide the rational design of future single&#8208;atom catalysts.

The synthesis and conformational analysis of pyran interhalides unveiled the shortest F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding involving Csp3&#8208;bound I and F atoms.








Abstract
There is growing interest in the preparation of multivicinal interhalide molecules. Herein, we described the synthesis of several pyran interhalide analogues of d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;mannose, d&#8208;talose, and d&#8208;glucose. A robust and simple halogeno&#8208;divergent strategy provided pyran&#8208;bearing multivicinal interhalide stereocenters. However, a different strategy was implemented for the synthesis of glucose interhalides. The solid&#8208;state conformational analysis of some interhalide analogues showed differences in the deviation of the intra&#8208;annular torsion angles. Moreover, we observed the shortest F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding (XB) involving Csp3&#8208;bound I and F atoms.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A networked molecular machine has been developed where protonation&#8208;induced metal translocation activates catalysis in a time&#8208;programmed manner. A silver(I)&#8208;loaded receptor and a [2]rotaxane undergo a reversible cascade upon fuel addition, transiently switching on the catalytic cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldoxime.








Abstract
We present a pivotal advancement in networked molecular machinery by integrating chemical&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven communication and catalysis. When the self&#8208;sorted system of a zinc hexacyclen, a silver(I)&#8208;loaded receptor, and a [2]rotaxane (= NetState&#8208;I) was exposed to 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as chemical fuel, the protonation first entailed a translocation of Zn2+ onto the receptor and, concomitantly, of silver(I) onto the [2]rotaxane, a cascade process that gradually reversed to the initial state. In the initial networked state, the silver(I) ions were tightly captured inside the receptor so that their catalytic activity was zero, while the transiently generated silver(I) [2]rotaxane (k298 = 176&#160;kHz) catalyzed the 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldoxime. The pulsed operation of this networked catalytic machinery, driven by chemical fuel, presents a novel paradigm for cascaded signaling and time&#8208;programmed catalysis, mimicking the complexity of biological systems.

         <title>Fluorinated Phenylazopyrazoles for Monitoring the Photoisomerization in Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated azopyrazole photoswitches can be obtained in a straightforward synthesis on a wide range of substrates and isomerize efficiently under light&#8208;irradiation. The molecular motion can be followed by 19F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy even in complex systems, such as dopants in vesicles. 








Abstract
Photoswitches have been impacting diverse areas of research, introducing means of dynamically regulating their environment through reversible photochemical isomerization. Among the different classes of photoswitches, phenylazopyrazoles (PAPs) stand out due to their facile synthesis, beneficial photochemical properties, and the long thermal stability of their metastable forms. Not surprisingly, they have been applied in different fields, from material sciences to pharmacology. However, once incorporated into complex systems, following the photoisomerization behavior of PAPs with routinely used analytical methods becomes challenging. In this work, we focused on synthesizing and studying the isomerization behavior of a series of differently substituted PAPs possessing two trifluoromethyl groups on the pyrazole moiety (F&#8208;PAPs). By studying their isomerization with steady&#8208;state and transient absorption spectroscopy, we found marked trends in the isomerization efficiency and photophysical properties of the different switches. Most importantly, these molecules can quantitatively isomerize between their stable and metastable forms, with relatively long lifetimes of thermal back relaxation. Leveraging these characteristics, we highlight in this work the potential application of F&#8208;PAPs as photoswitchable 19F&#8208;NMR probes to generate light&#8208;responsive vesicles.

         <title>Exploring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded 3D MOFs: High&#8208;Performance, Thermally Stable Self&#8208;Assembled Iodine&#8208;Encapsulated Frameworks with Optimal Energetic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>

Sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;based E&#8208;MOFs derived from TBTT were synthesized and evaluated for their energetic performance. These E&#8208;MOFs also exhibited promising iodine encapsulation ability, indicating their potential for dual energetic and environmental applications.








Abstract
Modern high&#8208;performing insensitive energetic materials are becoming more and more in demand to meet the growing needs of civilians and military applications. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of azole&#8208;based energetic molecules was described to construct potassium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;based energetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (E&#8208;MOFs) using polyazole&#8208;based energetic 5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)bis(1H&#8208;tetrazole) (TBTT) linker. The X&#8208;ray analysis authenticates K&#8208;MOF (1) and Na&#8208;MOF (2), introducing hydrogen&#8208;bonded 3D frameworks. Both compounds were extensively studied by thermogravimetric analysis&#8208;differential scanning calorimetry (TGA&#8208;DSC), elemental analysis (EA), infrared spectroscopy (IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses (PXRD). Further, mechanical sensitivity, detonation properties, and Hirshfeld surface analyses were examined. As expected, both E&#8208;MOFs showed excellent thermal decomposition temperature (Td = 333&#8211;387&#160;&#176;C), which exceeds benchmark explosives like hexahydro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (RDX) (210&#160;&#176;C), 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (318&#160;&#176;C), and 2,4,6&#8208;triamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trinitrobenzene (TATB) (315&#160;&#176;C). They also have shown high positive heat of formation (HOF&#160;=&#160;366&#8211;525&#160;kJ/mol) and superior detonation performance (VOD&#160;=&#160;6857&#8211;8903&#160;m/s; DP&#160;=&#160;17.41&#8211;28.23&#160;GPa). Additionally, the two E&#8208;MOFs exhibited low sensitivity toward impact sensitivity (IS &gt; 60&#160;J) and friction sensitivity (FS &gt; 360&#160;N), which may be attributed to strong structural reinforcement and multiple hydrogen bonding interactions, which is also proven by Hirshfeld surface analyses. Moreover, the high covalent bonds are beneficial in strengthening the E&#8208;MOF structures, which require high energy to collapse, thereby sustaining excellent thermal stability. E&#8208;MOFs 1 and 2 exhibit high iodine encapsulation and recyclability, maintaining effectiveness over six cycles, making them ideal for water remediation. Thus, compounds 1 and 2 can serve as promising next&#8208;generation highly thermally stable energetic materials, which can be a perfect replacement for currently used conventional explosives RDX, HNS, and TATB.

         <title>Chloride Selective, Nonprotonophoric Ion Transport with Macrocyclic Halogen Bonding Anionophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic halogen bonding anionophores are reported, which enable very high chloride over proton and hydroxide transport selectivity. This ion selectivity profile is key for future potential therapeutic applications, and its origin is explored through DFT and MD simulations at the membrane.








Abstract
Synthetic ion transporters hold promise as both chemical probes and potential therapeutics for diseases linked to malfunctioning protein ion transporters. However, their application in biological systems is limited, partly due to the cytotoxicity arising from unselective ion transport. Here, we demonstrate that highly active and selective anionophores can be accessed by combining halogen bonding anion recognition with macrocyclic anion encapsulation. Anion transport experiments in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) revealed over 300&#8208;fold selectivity for chloride transport over proton/hydroxide ions, which is key for potential future therapeutic applications, where the dissipation of cellular pH gradients must be avoided. The mechanism underpinning selectivity is studied through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at the membrane interface, demonstrating that the cyclic structure imposes an energetic preference for chloride binding over hydroxide, as well as a greater desolvation of hydroxide, which further disfavors its transport. We anticipate that these results will accelerate the transition toward the use of artificial chloride transport in biology.

         <title>Functionalized in Triplicate: A Ring&#8208;By&#8208;Ring Approach to Tailored Prodiginine Derivatives for Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Through Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prodigiosin is a potent cytotoxic alkaloid but lacks target selectivity. We advance functionalization of all three pyrrole rings of prodigiosin to enable site&#8208;specific conjugation via click chemistry. The presented azide&#8208; and maleimide&#8208;functionalized prodiginines are suitable for generating covalent prodiginine conjugates and attaching auspicious vectors for targeted drug delivery. The developed methodology promotes the expansion of conjugable pyrrole&#8208;based building blocks and natural products in the future.








Abstract
The tripyrrole prototype alkaloid prodigiosin and members of the prodigiosin family are structurally diverse bacterial secondary metabolites. The privileged scaffold accounts for versatile biological activities, for example, antimicrobial, antitumoral, and immunosuppressive. Its Lewis&#8208;basic lipophilic tripyrrole core and the aliphatic side chains allow for passive membrane diffusion, thereby trespassing the natural permeability barrier. However, diffusion&#8208;controlled uptake is accompanied by low target specificity, hampering the development of tailored prodigiosin therapeutics and their selective delivery to target sites. To address this downside, this work focuses on providing the chemical methodology to synthesize prodiginines that are amenable to click chemistry on each of the three pyrrole moieties and facilitate the development of prodigiosin conjugates. Installing reactive azides and maleimides in the A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and C&#8208;ring of the cytotoxic scaffold enables further functionalization per azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC and SPAAC) and thiol&#8208;maleimide addition, giving rise to protein&#8208;conjugable prodiginines for the first time. The presented synthetic routes comprise yields of 3.24.7% over 1215 steps and grant access to valuable synthetic elements for expanding the toolbox of click chemistry to other pyrrole&#8208;, pyrrolidinone&#8208;, and tetramic acid&#8208;containing natural products. Together, the devised methodology for prodiginine derivatization will collectively advance the development of alkaloid&#8208;based conjugate therapeutics, eligible for target&#8208;selective delivery.

         <title>Redox Cycling at Tellurium: Selective and Multiple Activation of Si&#9472;H Bonds in Common Organosilanes and SiH4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 43, August 1, 2025. </description>

The tellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] effectively activates the Si&#9472;H bonds of Et3SiH, Ph4&#8211;nSiHn (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3), SiH4, and complex H&#8208;siloxanes and catalytically converts them in the presence of quinones into siloxylated phenols of high interest for the chemical industry.








Abstract
Redox catalysis involving the tellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] was utilized for the activation of the common silanes Et3SiH, Ph4&#8211;nSiHn (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3) as well as the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle gaseous SiH4. Furthermore, complex siloxanes containing multiple Si&#9472;H bonds were converted into siloxylated phenols, which are of high interest for the chemical industry. Insights into the catalytic cycle utilizing para&#8208;quinones as both oxidants and substrates were provided by identification of key intermediates and by using in situ time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations. Based on this study, the catalytic cycle is initiated by a Si&#9472;H bond activation resulting in the formation of a ditelluride species and the corresponding silyl triflate. In turn, the ditelluride species is first oxidized by the presented quinone, forming an unprecedented tellurium&#8208;based oxonium intermediate, resulting in the formation of the siloxylated phenols and liberation of the tellurium catalyst upon subsequent reaction with the silyl triflate. Our proposed catalytic cycle can be generalized for any silane used in this study.

         <title>Crown Ether Supported Alkali Metal Phosphides: Synthesis, Structures and Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crowned! Herein we describe a complete series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal phosphides from lithium to cesium, including solid state structures, detailed investigations in solution and extensive quantum chemical investigation of the bonding situation.








Abstract
Herein we present the synthesis and full characterization of the previously unpresented lithium diphenyl phosphides Li(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)PPh2 (1Li) and Li(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)PPh2 (2Li) as well as the heavy homologues Rb(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Rb) and Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Cs). We thus complete the series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal diphenyl phosphides and reveal that the structural diversity increases upon descending the group. Including the previously reported Na and K derivatives, we performed a detailed study of the title compounds in solution that strongly indicated all of them are monomers with an alkali metal phosphide AM&#8211;P interaction. We further investigated the influence of the phosphorus&#8208;bound substituents on the bond between the Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) and the phosphide fragment. For this purpose, we synthesized and characterized two new cesium phosphides, alkyl&#8208;aryl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBuPh (4Cs) and bis&#8208;alkyl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBu2 (5Cs). We observed here that the heavy alkali metals Rb and Cs favor coordination via &#960;&#8208;arene interactions&#160;over the P donor dative interactions. Finally, we used state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical methods to analyze the bonding situation in the title series of compounds.

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation in Co complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands is either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to paramagnetic high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with radical monocationic diguanidine ligands or low&#8208;spin CoIII redox isomers with neutral diguanidine ligands. Careful ligand design leads to the energetic harmonization of the two redox isomers and realization of one&#8208;electron oxidation processes that are both metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered.








Abstract
In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation) or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine&#8208;tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin&#8208;switching devices.

         <title>Spacer Group Modified Naphthalimide with Acidichromism and Mechanochromism for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P1 powder shows no fluorescence because of PET between tertiary amines and naphthalimide. P1&#8208;HCl powder exhibits bright blue emission because HCl can bind onto the lone&#8208;pair electrons of trimethylamine to prevent PET. The highly twisted conformation of P1&#8208;HCl has enough steric effect, contributing to obvious red&#8208;shifted mechanochromism.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence materials are crucial in developing intelligent materials and have wide applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. However, organic fluorescence dyes with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interactions and dense molecular packing lead to inertia ability of stimuli&#8208;responsive. Here, we design and synthesize spacer group modified naphthalimide compounds (P1 and P2) with acidichromism and mechanochromism properties. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between naphthalimide and trimethylamine moieties quenches fluorescence of P1 and P2. Then, fluorescence is obtained when P1 and P2 interact with hydrochloric acid (named P1&#8208;HCl and P2&#8208;HCl). More importantly, the spacer group modified P1&#8208;HCl with a highly twisted conformation, preventing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and a compact packing structure, contributing to obvious mechanochromism, while P2&#8208;HCl does not. Our study provides a molecular strategy to investigate the relationship between molecular chemical structure and stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties and realizes anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

Stable CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs synthesized by using ICA ligand effectively enhances the Photoluminescence (PL) and PLQY. These mixed nanocrystals show high responsivity in prototype photodetector device.








Abstract
Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate the NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by a ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation approach. Incorporating the ICA ligand in place of long&#8208;chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of nonradiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518&#160;nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the PL quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75&#160;&#177;&#160;2% to 94&#160;&#177;&#160;2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. To demonstrate the potential application of the material in optoelectronics, a photodetector based on mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs is fabricated, which exhibits the maximum responsivity of 1.133&#160;mA/W at 9&#160;mW/cm2 incident power density and faster rise and fall times of 0.31&#160;ms and 1.19&#160;ms, respectively. The specific detectivity of the device is 1.608&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8313; Jones with an incident power of 9&#160;mW/cm2.

         <title>Synthesis of Hyperbranched Polyurethane Acrylate as Self&#8208;cleaning Protective Film on Solar Panel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched polyurethane acrylate (PHBA) was synthesized and blended with epoxy acrylate (EB600) to fabricate protective coatings for solar panels. The multifunctional coating exhibits satisfactory comprehensive properties, significantly prolonging the service life of solar panels. The research provides a feasible strategy for manufacturing high&#8208;performance protective coatings.








Abstract
Renewable and green energy technologies, particularly the improvement of solar panel efficiency, have gained considerable attention in academic and industrial communities. However, long&#8208;term exposure to soiling can lead to substantial reduction in the energy generation capacity of photovoltaic systems. Here, hyperbranched polyurethane acrylate (PHBA) was synthesized using hydroxyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polyester as a core component. PHBA was subsequently blended with epoxy acrylate (EB600) and rapidly UV&#8208;cured to fabricate protective coatings for solar panels. The polymeric coating exhibited outstanding mechanical properties, including tensile strength of about 65.43 MPa, the elongation at break of about 3.73%, adhesion of 1 level, and pencil hardness of 6H. The hyperbranched topological structure can remarkably improve the mechanical properties and extend the service life of solar panels. Moreover, the uniform dispersion of siloxane coupling agent in the polymer matrix improved hydrophobic properties, which effectively reduced dust deposition and maintained voltage stability. The high&#8208;performance polymeric coating has shown great application potential in solar panel protective films.

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS Through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the F&#8208;doped NiCoPS nanowires were synthesized&#160;as a high&#8208;performance catalyst for seawater oxygen evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the strongly electronegative fluorine improves the surface electronic structure of NiCoPS, further enhancing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and electronic conductivity. This work provides an efficient strategy to design effective and durable oxygen evolution reaction(OER) electrocatalysts in alkaline seawater.








Abstract
Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine&#160;ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100)&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the Tafel slope (44&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100&#160;hours. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient, and nonnoble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New examples of (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions of Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) with 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylallenes in the presence of GaCl3 were demonstrated. The starting DACs act in these processes as the source of 1,3&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates. Substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, tetrahydrobenzo[c]fluorenylmalonates, and exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates were obtained with high diastereoselectivity and good yields.








Abstract
The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0 &#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) Reactivity from Carbone&#8211;BPh3 Lewis Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) reactivity toward the activation of various small molecules and the catalytic reduction of ketones have been demonstrated using a carbodicarbene (CDC)&#9472;BPh3 adduct. Mechanistic studies, including NMR exchange spectroscopy and DFT calculations, reveal that reversible adduct dissociation generates a transient encounter complex essential for the observed FLP&#8208;type reactivity.








Abstract
We present a systematic investigation of the Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) chemistry of carbodicarbenes (fCDCs) featuring varied steric profiles in combination with strong (B(C6F5)3, BCF) and weak (BPh3) boron Lewis acids. The resulting CDC&#8211;borane systems display a full spectrum of behaviors: (i) tightly bound Lewis adducts lacking FLP reactivity, (ii) adducts exhibiting reversible dissociation and activate small molecules via FLP&#8208;type reactivity, and (iii) a &#8220;classical&#8221; FLP that remain unbound. The most reactive Lewis adduct, 1&#183;BPh3, which exhibits the lowest dissociation energy, activates a broad range of bonds (C&#9472;H, O&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, H&#9472;B, H&#9472;Si, S&#9472;S, and CO2) and catalyzes hydroboration and hydrosilylation of ketones under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions. NMR exchange spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that its FLP reactivity originates from reversible dissociation and the formation of a reactive transient encounter complex. These findings establish carbone&#8208;based Lewis adducts as tunable platforms for FLP&#8208;type small molecule activation and main&#8208;group catalysis, where reactivity can be regulated through steric and electronic modulation.

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) reactivity toward the activation of various small molecules and the catalytic reduction of ketones have been demonstrated using a carbodicarbene (CDC)&#9472;BPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adduct. Mechanistic studies, including NMR exchange spectroscopy and DFT calculations, reveal that reversible adduct dissociation generates a transient encounter complex essential for the observed FLP-type reactivity.

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;Lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated Through Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
An array of spectroscopic methods including femto&#8208;nanosecond optical transient absorption and nanosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies resolve the singlet intraligand charge transfer (1ILCT) and triplet (3ILCT) states in a family of Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Zn&#8208;based photosensitizers with phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligands. These results are crucial toward suggesting designs of new Zn&#8208;based complexes that can be employed for energy transfer and photoredox catalytic reactions.








Abstract
ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes, namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate, and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer, and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs, and 730 fs, respectively, while nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s, and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8&#160;ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates of less than 13&#160;ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; noncovalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer versus the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing photoredox processes.

         <title>A Fluorinated Anodic Aluminum Oxide Nanopores Coating Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Self&#8208;healing Triboelectrification and Anti&#8208;corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerator with the surface of alumina nanostructures by anodic oxidation method was prepared. Compared to TENG with aluminum sheets, TENG with alumina nanopores has higher triboelectric output. Low surface energy compounds loaded in alumina nanopores can migrate to the surface to achieve a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.








Abstract
The triboelectric layer is a key component affecting the performance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Herein, a TENG with a triboelectric layer possessing a fluorinated&#8208;anodic&#8208;alumina&#8208;nanopores structure was prepared. The nanopores structure can increase the contact area and thus increase the triboelectric output. The fluorination treatment further increased the output. The current output of this TENG is 10.4&#160;&#181;A, while that of the TENG with a pristine&#8208;aluminum&#8208;based triboelectric layer is 3.7&#160;&#181;A. The ability of the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy compounds loaded in the alumina nanopores to migrate to the surface leads to a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DP4+&#8208;predicted (8R,10R,19R)&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 stereoisomer and the C11&#8208;epimeric structures of iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 with the hydroxyl groups located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9 and C11) as biogenetically inspired by the collinearity principle of their modular sequence, namely (9S,11S,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;1 and (9S,11R,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;2, were stereoselectively synthesized, but the NMR data did not match those of the natural product, which keeps its structure undetermined.








Abstract
Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische's allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11&#8208;diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11&#8208;dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150) with formal syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diol configurations were completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product, and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary transformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#9472;N versus C&#9472;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl 2'&#8208;deoxyadenosine and adenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from the nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.

         <title>Harnessing the Biosynthetic Diversity of Actinomycetes: Discovery of Unique Natural Products Through Comparative Genomic and Metabolic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparative analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (sBGCs) in Actinomycetes revealed that Pseudonocardiaceae strains possess abundant, diverse, and strain&#8208;specific sBGCs. Molecular networking&#8208;based strategy identified lentindoles A and B, novel peptides with rare 6/5/6 and 6/5/5 tricyclic scaffolds, as strain&#8208;specific metabolites from a Lentzea strain. This approach offers a promising strategy for discovering novel natural products.








Abstract
Actinomycetes, rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), are important sources of natural products (NPs). However, the rate of discovering novel NPs from actinomycetes has declined, indicating the need for a new strategy to obtain NPs. Herein, we present a strategy for the efficient discovery of novel NPs. First, we performed a comprehensive analysis of BGCs in actinomycetes, evaluating the average number and types of BGCs per genus to identify prolific NP producers. Our analysis revealed that certain actinomycete strains, such as those in the family Pseudonocardiaceae, possess a greater number of BGCs than Streptomyces. In addition, these strains tend to possess strain&#8208;specific BGCs compared with others. To facilitate the identification of strain&#8208;specific compounds, we developed a comparative metabolic analysis method using molecular networking. Applying this method to eight Pseudonocardiaceae strains, we successfully discovered two novel peptides, lentindoles A (1) and B (2), featuring a 6/5/6 and 6/5/5 tricyclic ring system, respectively, along with their possible biosynthetic precursor, lentindole C (3). Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our developed strategy, which is expected to accelerate the discovery of novel NPs.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Cytotoxic Evaluation of New Structurally Simplified and Highly Potent Third&#8208;Generation Tubulysin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the first solid&#8208;phase synthesis of novel third&#8208;generation tubulin inhibitors without tubuvaline and tubuphenylalanine fragments, earlier considered essential for anticancer activities. The simplified tubulysin derivatives obtained in high yields have shown potent cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines from prostate, lung, breast, cervical, and skin cancers with IC50 values in the low nM range (IC50 = 13&#8211;53&#160;nM).








Abstract
Tubulysins belong to a class of natural products originally isolated from myxobacteria culture and are known to induce cell apoptosis through inhibition of microtubule assembly. Herein, we report the computationally designed, structurally simplified, and first solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis of novel third&#8208;generation tubulin inhibitors in high yields. These inhibitors are devoid of tubuvaline and tubuphenylalanine fragments previously considered essential for tubulin inhibition activity. The most potent inhibitor contains four fragments arranged from the N terminal to the C terminal as N&#8208;methyl pipecolic acid, isoleucine, valine&#8208;thiazole, and asparagine. The hydrophilic tubulin inhibitors demonstrated significant anticancer activity, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (IC50 = 13&#8211;53&#160;nM) within a 48&#160;hours incubation period across prostate, lung, breast, skin, and cervical cancer cell lines. The synthetic strategy incorporates a simplified valine&#8208;thiazole ring structure, retaining both biological activity and chiral integrity of the molecules. The method enables the synthesis of potent tubulin inhibitors by avoiding multistep synthetic and purification procedures, supporting the inhibitor's applicability for large&#8208;scale synthesis and potential therapeutic development. The structural modifications at the N&#8208;terminal result in the loss of activity from nM to &#181;M range, whereas the C&#8208;terminal modification had minimal impact on the potency.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Phosphorescence of a Trans&#8208;Bis(iminomethylpyrolato)Platinum Complex Bearing a Polymethylene Vaulted Structure: Chain Length&#8211;Dependent Solid&#8208;State Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum(II) complexes featuring a vaulted polymethylene bridge exhibit efficient AIE. An odd&#8208;even effect in chain length is also observed in the AIE behavior, where strong phosphorescence emerges from dimer formation in crystals. Theoretical calculations imply that dimerization raises the MECP, suppressing nonradiative decay.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) has recently attracted considerable attention. Although phosphorescent transition&#8208;metal complexes exhibit significant potential as aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), their exploration and utilization have remained limited, partly due to the insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we report a new series of platinum(II) complexes, trans&#8208;bis(2&#8208;iminomethylpyrrolato)platinum derivatives (1a&#8211;d), which feature vaulted polymethylene chains of varying lengths (n&#160;=&#160;9&#8211;12) that bridge over the metal atom. Notably, racemic complexes 1b and 1d (with chain lengths of 10 and 12) exhibit strong yellow emission in the crystalline state (quantum yields of 24% and 33%, respectively), despite showing no emission in solution. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer packing in these emissive crystals, suggesting that dimer formation contributes to their enhanced emission. In contrast, complexes with odd&#8208;numbered chain lengths (1a and 1c) showed no such emission enhancement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the excited triplet and ground state lies at significantly higher energy in the dimeric structure than in the monomer, suggesting suppression of nonradiative decay in the crystalline state. This work provides a design strategy for inducing solid&#8208;state phosphorescence by controlling the 3D molecular structure to facilitate favorable molecular stacking while suppressing nonradiative decay pathways.

         <title>Vacancy Engineering of Fe&#8208;Doped CoNi2S4@CC Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC with sulfur vacancies (Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC). The catalyst exhibited excellent OER and overall water splitting performance, which is attributed to the fact that vacancy engineering and iron doping synergistically promote charge transfer to enhance the catalyst performance.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfides have emerged as promising alternatives to precious metal catalysts for sustainable electrocatalytic hydrogen production. However, achieving simultaneous optimization of active site exposure and vacancy&#8208;electron interplay remains a critical challenge. Herein, we develop a dual&#8208;regulation strategy integrating Fe&#8208;doping and high&#8208;temperature annealing to synthesize sulfur&#8208;deficient Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC nanocatalysts (Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC). The approach innovatively combines heteroatom doping and vacancy engineering, where iron doping leads to lattice dilation and sulfur vacancies create vacancy defects, thereby exposing a large number of active sites. The designed catalysts have iron&#8208;induced charge redistribution and vacancy tailored adsorption energies synergistically in the dual active center and expose more active sites to accelerate charge transfer. Intriguingly, the Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC achieves a low overpotential of 194.72 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, surpassing most reported CoNi&#8208;based sulfides. More remarkably, it demonstrates exceptional kinetics with a Tafel slope of 43.2&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and enhanced active site utilization evidenced by its high electrochemical double layer capacitance value (31.3 mF cm&#8722;2). This work presents a significant advance for the rational design of high&#8208;performance OER catalysts by demonstrating a synergistic modulation strategy that integrates cation doping and vacancy engineering in Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC, which not only optimizes the electronic structure but also increases the rate of charge transfer to enhance the catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;We have synthesized Fe-doped CoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CC with sulfur vacancies (Fe-CoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4-x&lt;/sub&gt;@CC). The catalyst exhibited excellent OER and overall water splitting performance, which is attributed to the fact that vacancy engineering and iron doping synergistically promote charge transfer to enhance the catalyst performance.

A semi&#8208;automated high&#8208;throughput synthesis station, developed within the MAITENA platform, features two modular units: one for solid&#8208;state and wet&#8208;chemistry routes (ceramic, sol&#8208;gel, Pechini), and another for microwave&#8208;assisted solvothermal synthesis. It enables reproducible workflows, phase diagram exploration, and morphology control, demonstrated on Li&#8208;ion battery materials.








Abstract
The development of sustainable advanced materials is increasingly driven by the need for sustainable, faster, scalable, and more efficient research workflows. Advancements in computational screening, high&#8208;throughput experimentation, and artificial intelligence (AI) are accelerating progress in materials discovery. To fully leverage the benefits of these complementary approaches, the implementation of materials acceleration platforms (MAPs) and self&#8208;driving laboratories (SDL) has emerged as a promising strategy. Here, we present the development of a semi&#8208;automated station for the lab&#8208;scale high&#8208;throughput synthesis (HTS) of inorganic materials, as part of the Materials Acceleration and Innovation plaTform for ENergy Applications (MAITENA). The system integrates two in&#8208;house&#8208;designed liquid&#8208;handling modules capable of performing sol&#8208;gel, Pechini, solid&#8208;state, and hydro/solvothermal syntheses. Each module enables the preparation of several dozen gram&#8208;scale samples per week with high reproducibility and minimal manual intervention. The system's capabilities are demonstrated through three case studies involving Li&#8208;ion battery materials. Results highlight the module's utilization for efficient screening of compositions and synthesis conditions to vary materials&#8217; properties. This accessible and modular infrastructure offers a practical route to implementing high&#8208;throughput strategies in inorganic materials research.

         <title>Enhanced Reactivity of N&#8208;heterocyclic Halophosphines and Phosphenium Cations: The Activation of Carbon&#9472;Heteroatom and Boron&#9472;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel class of saturated NHPs with phosphoramidothioate substituents exhibit enhanced reactivity in photoinitiated transfer hydrogenation reactions and activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, and B&#9472;F bonds via phosphenium cation formation.








Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphines (NHPs), and especially their ionic derivatives, phosphenium cations, have gained significant attention not only as isoelectronic species to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) but mainly, as highly Lewis acidic, active organocatalysts. A novel type of saturated NHPs has been introduced, with the nitrogen atoms substituted by phosphoramidothioates&#8211;{[&#954;2&#8208;O,O&#8208;(OCH2C(Me)2CH2O)P(= S)]2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;[NCH2CH2N]}PX, where X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, H, Ph, and their derivatives. Thanks to an increased positive charge at the P(III) atom, these compounds are prone to activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, or B&#9472;F bonds and open cyclic ethers through the formation of intermediate species&#8211;phosphenium cations. The hydrido derivative can effectively catalyze the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene by ammonia borane when irradiated by UV light at room temperature. The self&#8208;ionization of the iodido derivative promoted by the coordination of less sterically demanding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene enables the isolation of a phosphenium cation.

         <title>Cooperative B&#9472;H Bond Activation: A Direct Route to Monometallic Diborane(5) and Dihydroborate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of hemilabile ligands in &#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;chelated iridium and rhodium complexes on small molecule activation has been systematically investigated (E = S or Se). These complexes facilitate B&#9472;H bond activation, leading to the formation of diborane(5) and dihydroborate species (see picture).








Abstract
To study the role of hemilabile ligands in B&#9472;H bond activation, &#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;chelated iridium and rhodium complexes, [Cp*M(&#954;1&#8208;E&#8208;C5H4NE)(&#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;C5H4NE)] (2a: M = Ir, E = S; 2b: M = Ir, E = Se; 2c: M = Rh, E = S; 2b: M = Rh, E = Se) have been synthesized by salt metathesis reactions of [Cp*MCl2]2 (1a: M = Ir, 1a: M = Rh) and potassium salts of thio&#8208;/seleno&#8208;pyridine ligands. The strained four&#8208;membered rings in 2a&#8208;d indicate their potential for activating small molecules. Indeed, treatment of 2a&#8208;b with [BH3&#8901;THF] afforded monometallic diborane(5) complexes, [(Cp*IrIIIH){&#954;3&#8208;B,B,Se&#8208;(B2H4&#8208;C5H4NE)}] (3a: E = S, 3b: E = Se) and transition metal (TM)&#8208;dihydroborate complexes, [(&#951;4&#8208;C5Me5H)IrI{&#954;2&#8208;H,H,E&#8208;(H3B&#8208;C5H4NE))] (4a: E = S, 4b: E = Se). Complexes 3a&#8208;b, containing a [Cp*IrH] unit, stabilize the non&#8208;classical [B2H4(C5H4NE)]&#8722; fragment, presumably generated through B&#9472;H activation at the Ir&#9472;N bond and subsequent dehydrogenation. In contrast, the Rh analogues 2c&#8208;d yielded dihydroborate rhodium(I) complexes, [(&#951;4&#8208;C5Me5H)RhI{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,E&#8208;(H3B&#8208;C5H4NE)}] (4c: E = S, 4d: E = Se) through B&#9472;H bond insertion into the Rh&#9472;N bonds followed by cyclopentadienyl ring slippage. In an attempt to synthesize a rhodium analogue of 3b, complex 4d is treated with [BH3&#8901;THF] which generated an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;zwitterionic rhodium complex, [Cp*Rh(&#956;3&#8208;Se){BH2(C5H4NSe)}2], 5 comprising a bicyclo [4.4.0] cage.

         <title>Supramolecular Protection of Carboxylic Acids via Hydrogen Bonding: Selectivity, Reversibility, and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular protecting group (sPG) enables selective esterification of monocarboxylic acids in the presence of dicarboxylic acids. A systems chemistry model was used to identify key parameters that govern selectivity, yielding general design principles for sPGs.








Abstract
A supramolecular protecting group (sPG) was developed that can selectively protect dicarboxylic acids, enabling the preferential esterification of monocarboxylic acids. The high selectivity (selectivity factor s&#160;=&#160;72) was achieved through reversible hydrogen bonding and measured under synthetically relevant conditions. This strategy offers an efficient and dynamic alternative to traditional covalent protecting groups. To deepen understanding and optimize the performance of the supramolecular approach, a systems chemistry model was developed, which was validated by the good agreement with experimental results. The computational model was then used to explore parameter space and define selectivity&#8208;limiting factors. The insights gained from the model guided the optimization of reaction conditions and provided general principles for using supramolecular protecting groups (sPGs). This strategy is expected to have broad implications for the development of new synthetic tools for efficient and selective organic chemical transformations in the selective functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>The Impact of X&#8208;ray Damage in Chemical Crystalline Materials and New Opportunities for Small Molecule Serial Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of X&#8208;ray damage in chemical crystals was minimised by the introduction of area detectors in the late 20th&#8208;century. Now, ever&#8208;brighter X&#8208;ray sources are re&#8208;establishing X&#8208;ray damage as a key challenge. This article reviews recent observations of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced processes in chemical samples and discusses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for their mitigation.








Abstract
In line with the dramatic and continuing improvements in X&#8208;ray generation technologies for laboratory and accelerator sources around the world, reports of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced processes in chemical crystalline materials are on the rise. These observations are challenging the traditional viewpoint that radiation damage is only of significant concern for protein structure determinations, encouraging small molecule crystallographers to identify and address X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced effects in a broadening range of susceptible materials. This review explores the recent investigations into X&#8208;ray damage and X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced transformations in chemical crystalline materials and discusses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies to quantify and mitigate the effects of the X&#8208;ray probe on single&#8208;crystal and microcrystalline powder samples.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Novel Glycerol&#8208;Derived Liquids with Dual Functional Groups: Nonsymmetric (E/Z)&#8208;Isomeric Mixtures of 1,3&#8208;Diether&#8208;2&#8208;Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Nonsymmetric (E/Z) isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;diether&#8208;2&#8208;alkene molecules based on a glycerol skeleton were synthesized via elimination reaction of precursors with varied R groups. The resulting products were thoroughly characterized using both experimental and computational techniques. The C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C double bond was also shown to be reactive for thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, indicating that these molecules may also have use as chemical intermediates. These alkenes expand the portfolio of products and reactions that utilize the advantageous versatility of glycerol and related products.








Abstract
This study introduces the synthesis and detailed characterization of six novel nonsymmetric (E/Z)&#8208;isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;diether&#8208;2&#8208;alkenes derived from precursors with a glycerol skeleton: 1&#8208;((3&#8208;butoxyallyl)oxy)heptane ([H, A, B]), 1&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)&#8208;5&#8208;methylhex&#8208;2&#8208;ene ([ME, A, IP]), 1&#8208;((3&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)butane ([ME, A, B]), ((3&#8208;isopropoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene ([IP, A, Ph]), ((3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene ([F, A, Ph]), and 1&#8208;(allyloxy)&#8208;3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;ene ([F, A, A]). These compounds were synthesized via a three&#8208;step reaction starting from various glycidyl ethers, purified by fractional distillation and drying, and obtained with overall isolated yields of at least 60%. The ratio of isomer configurations (E:E:Z:Z) varied based on substituents R1 and R2. Thermophysical properties, including density, refractive index (RI), and viscosity, were evaluated at temperatures of 293.15 to 333.15 and 353.15&#160;K. CO2 absorption capacity (Henry's constants) of compound [F, A, A] was assessed at temperatures of 303.15, 318.15, 333.15, and 348.15&#160;K under CO2 pressures from 2 to 10 atm. Density, viscosity, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, and dipole moment were also calculated for each compound. Moreover, the nonsymmetric alkenes&#8217; C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C double bond was shown to readily react with thiols via thiol&#8208;ene coupling. The resulting thioether linkage exhibits high stability under physiological conditions, making these compounds promising intermediates for synthesizing more complex glycerol&#8208;based molecules.

         <dc:description>
Program catalysis with light: Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive peptide assembly system which switches between thermodynamically stable equilibrium nanofibers and energy&#8208;dependent nonequilibrium nanoparticles via SPs photoisomerization, enabling programmable control of catalytic activity in Michael addition reactions.








Abstract
The dynamic regulation of self&#8208;assembled structures in nonequilibrium states is critical for mimicking biological functions, where energy&#8208;driven processes underpin spatiotemporal control of molecular activities. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive peptide assembly system that switches between thermodynamically stable equilibrium nanofibers and energy&#8208;dependent nonequilibrium nanoparticles. This dual&#8208;state behavior is enabled by spiropyran's (SPs) photoisomerization, which switches between the closed&#8208;ring SP and open&#8208;ring merocyanine (MC) forms. Crucially, this morphological transition enables programmable control of catalytic activity in Michael addition reactions. In the dark&#8208;stable equilibrium state, the nanofiber formed by peptide 1 exhibited robust catalysis, achieving over 95% yield. Under blue light, the nonequilibrium nanoparticle assembly of 1 completely abolished catalytic activity. Intermittent light exposure further demonstrates programmable regulation of reaction progression.&#160;The system's ability to couple structural dynamics with functional modulation offers a new avenue for designing programmable catalysts and adaptive materials.

         <title>Tetrahydropyranyl Backbone Protection for Enhanced Fmoc Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Fmoc solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis has been indispensable for the efficient manufacture of research grade peptides and proteins, and peptide APIs. However, the solid&#8208;phase approach is still hampered by solubility issues and aggregation of the resin&#8208;bound peptide chain, which limits routine access to peptides&#160;&gt;&#160;40 amino acids in length. The use of backbone amide protecting groups, such as through the introduction of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;based moieties and pseudoproline dipeptides, ameliorates this synthetic inefficiency somewhat. But benzyl groups can be difficult to remove postassembly, and pseudoprolines are limited to serine, threonine, and cysteine&#8208;rich peptide segments. To enhance the utility of backbone protection, we have evaluated the tetrahydropyranyl (Thp) group as a more acid labile alternative to benzyl protection. The Thp group can be efficiently introduced to the resin&#8208;bound peptide as a protected dipeptide and is readily cleaved and scavenged postsynthesis. A drastic improvement in the solid&#8208;phase assembly of aggregation&#8208;prone amyloid&#8208;&#946; and prion&#8208;derived peptide fragments is observed using Thp as a backbone protecting group. We envisage that Thp&#8208;protected dipeptides will become useful building blocks for peptide manufacturing, complementing existing backbone protecting group strategies.

         <title>Reversible and Irreversible Regioselective Alkyne Insertion into a Silyl&#8208;Substituted Stannylene</title>

Alkyne insertion into the Sn&#9472;Si bond of a silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene occurs regio&#8208;selectively and &#8208; in the cases of more sterically encumbered substrates &#8208; reversibly








Abstract
A range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted alkynes has been shown to insert regio&#8208;selectively into the Sn&#9472;Si bond of the electron&#8208;rich aryl(silyl)stannylene, ArMesSnSi(SiMe3)3 (ArMes&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3, Mes&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) to generate a series of vinyl&#8208;stannylene products. In all cases, the product features a syn arrangement of Sn and Si&#8208;containing groups about the resulting carbon&#8211;carbon double bond; in the case of unsymmetrical alkynes, the more sterically bulky group is exclusively incorporated in the 1&#8208;position (i.e., proximal to Sn). Remarkably, insertion is shown to occur reversibly in the cases of 3&#8208;hexyne and trimethylsilylacetylene. The thermodynamic parameters associated with these processes have been determined by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy, and the activation barriers associated with the key mechanistic steps elucidated by quantum mechanical methods.

         <title>Discotic Liquid Crystalline Phenazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the influence of molecular design, specifically the roles of chemical structure, conformation, and geometry on the self&#8208;assembly and functional properties of phenazine&#8208;based DLCs relevant to optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Phenazines, otherwise known as dibenzo&#8208;annulated pyrazines, are a unique class of tricyclic organic molecules. They are chemically stable and highly aromatic due to their extended conjugation. Along with their biomedicinal significance, phenazines often play a major role in manipulating the optical as well as electrical properties of organic semiconductors. The planar structure in the heterocyclic aromatic phenazines and their natural inclination to form stacked columns due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between two consecutive molecules have made them quite a suitable moiety for the formation as well as extension of the core part of discotic liquid crystals (DLCs). Their&#160;efficient charge&#8208;carrying ability makes them well&#8208;suited for organic electronic materials. Furthermore, their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned with simple chemical changes, rendering them appropriate for many advanced applications. This review focuses on the chemistry of phenazine&#8208;based DLCs and their significance in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Influence of Water, Vacuum, and Temperature on Surface Conditions of a Zeolite&#8208;based Molecular Sieve</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses a research gap regarding commercially available zeolites. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) is applied to determine the size and concentration of water&#8208;free volumes at various hydration levels and to monitor minute&#8208;scale adsorption and desorption dynamics. The bead binder does not block water access to zeolite cages, and in air&#8208;dried samples, water molecules remain near Na&#8314; ions.








Abstract
Molecular sieves such as zeolite&#8208;based materials are ubiquitous in industrial separation processes. However, there is a significant gap in understanding the surface properties and adsorption mechanisms for commercial zeolites, as most research focuses on pure zeolite powders rather than industrially relevant forms. This work addresses this gap in understanding by employing advanced characterization techniques, including positron annihilation spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray fluorescence spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, liquid nitrogen sorption, and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, to investigate the adsorption and desorption behavior of water in commercial zeolite 13X. Our research reveals insights into the pore&#8208;filling mechanisms, the impact of material binders on adsorption properties, and the dynamics of hydration and drying processes for zeolites. Monitoring changes on a minute scale allowed the distinction between fast and slow processes leading to sample drying. The identification of positronium bound to Na+ ions indicated that water molecules remain in the vicinity of Na+ ions after air&#8208;drying zeolite 13X. These findings highlight the importance of various environmental conditions in restoring zeolite properties to baseline after hydration, with significant implications for optimizing industrial processes. This work sets the direction for further research aimed at developing more efficient and robust separation techniques.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Controllable Self&#8208;Sorting in Macrocyclic Supramolecular Assemblies: Homochiral and Heterochiral 1D Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral self&#8208;sorting, involving narcissistic and social pathways, generates homochiral and heterochiral supramolecular assemblies. Herein, guest moieties with different rigidity were introduced into macrocyclic pillar[5]arene hosts to regulate chiral sequences. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that rigid guests induce homochiral sequences, while flexible ones favor heterochiral sequences, enabling controlled chiral sequences in macrocyclic supramolecular systems.








Abstract
Chiral self&#8208;sorting, including both narcissistic and social self&#8208;sorting, can generate homochiral and heterochiral supramolecular assemblies, respectively. However, achieving control over both pathways through molecular design remains challenging. Herein, we designed a series of macrocyclic pillar[5]arene derivatives with linear chains that thread into the cavities of adjacent molecules in the crystal, forming 1D superstructures. By varying the rigidity of these linear chains, we discovered that the rigidity dictated chiral preference: rigid chains induced homochiral arrangements, whereas flexible chains favored heterochiral arrangements. Mechanistically, the close packing of adjacent pillar[5]arenes through host&#8211;guest supramolecular system played a crucial role in controlling the chiral sequence.

         <title>Fluorescent Zr(IV) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Rapid and Sensitive Detection of Acidic Nitrophenols in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three functionalized Zr(IV) MOFs detect nitrophenols in water by rapid and strong fluorescence quenching with detection limits below 0.040 &#181;M, showing promise for real&#8208;time, in&#8208;field applications.








Abstract
Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are widely used industrial chemicals, recognized as both environmental pollutants and explosive hazards. Optical sensors are gaining increasing research ground as they&#160;offer a platform for the&#160;rapid and efficient in&#8208;field detection of NACs. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of three new fluorescent&#160;metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on Zr(IV) and structurally analogous to UiO&#8208;66, with the assigned formula {Zr6O4(OH)8(H2O)4(L)1&#8208;x(NH2bdc2&#8722;)x}. The incorporation of strongly fluorescent ligands 2&#8208;((2&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amino)terephthalic acid (L&#8208;2), 2&#8208;((3&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amino)terephthalic acid (L&#8208;3), and 2&#8208;((4&#8208;methoxybenzyl) amino)terephthalic acid (L&#8208;4) resulted in the formation of MOFs Zr&#8208;2, Zr&#8208;3, and Zr&#8208;4, respectively. These materials feature pendant &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic groups and basic secondary amine functionalities, which are suitable for donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with the electron&#8208;deficient and acidic NACs 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenol (TNP) and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol (DNP). Fluorescence titration experiments on protonated samples (pZr&#8208;2, pZr&#8208;3, and pZr&#8208;4) demonstrate that our MOFs selectively respond to small concentrations of TNP and DNP in H2O, by exhibiting strong emission quenching with detection limits estimated below 0.030 &#181;M for TNP and 0.040 &#181;M for DNP. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies reveal very fast response times (&#8764;1&#160;s) for pZr&#8208;2 and pZr&#8208;3, making them promising candidates for real&#8208;time, in&#8208;field detection applications.

&lt;p&gt;Three functionalized Zr(IV) MOFs detect nitrophenols in water by rapid and strong fluorescence quenching with detection limits below 0.040 &#181;M, showing promise for real-time, in-field applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are widely used industrial chemicals, recognized as both environmental pollutants and explosive hazards. Optical sensors are gaining increasing research ground as they&#160;offer a platform for the&#160;rapid and efficient in-field detection of NACs. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of three new fluorescent&#160;metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on Zr(IV) and structurally analogous to UiO-66, with the assigned formula {Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(L)&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bdc&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}. The incorporation of strongly fluorescent ligands 2-((2-methoxybenzyl)amino)terephthalic acid (&lt;b&gt;L-2&lt;/b&gt;), 2-((3-methoxybenzyl)amino)terephthalic acid (&lt;b&gt;L-3&lt;/b&gt;), and 2-((4-methoxybenzyl) amino)terephthalic acid (&lt;b&gt;L-4&lt;/b&gt;) resulted in the formation of MOFs &lt;b&gt;Zr-2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Zr-3&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Zr-4&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. These materials feature pendant &#960;-electron-rich aromatic groups and basic secondary amine functionalities, which are suitable for donor-acceptor interactions with the electron-deficient and acidic NACs 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Fluorescence titration experiments on protonated samples (&lt;b&gt;pZr-2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;pZr-3&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;pZr-4&lt;/b&gt;) demonstrate that our MOFs selectively respond to small concentrations of TNP and DNP in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, by exhibiting strong emission quenching with detection limits estimated below 0.030 &#181;M for TNP and 0.040 &#181;M for DNP. Time-resolved fluorescence studies reveal very fast response times (&#8764;1&#160;s) for &lt;b&gt;pZr-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;pZr-3&lt;/b&gt;, making them promising candidates for real-time, in-field detection applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Photoreactions: A Source for Metal&#8208;Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of a mixture containing a photoinitiator, metal salt, and monomers in an aqueous or alcoholic medium yields nanocomposites. We present a straightforward method for their synthesis and demonstrate their application as heterogeneous catalysts.








Abstract
We have developed a one&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot photo&#8208;induced method for synthesizing metal/polymer nanocomposites. This approach utilizes the photolysis of a bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (BAPO) photoinitiator. Two types of radicals are formed. One initiates a radical polymerization while the other acts as a reducing agent in aqueous or alcoholic media. As a result, metal nanoparticles are formed in situ during polymerization and become embedded within the growing polymer matrix. This simultaneous formation and incorporation lead to the direct immobilization of metal centers, yielding stable nanocomposites. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we established mechanistic details and characterized the composites. We have evaluated their activity in well&#8208;established catalytic reactions. Here, Pd composites were used for Suzuki coupling, Cu for alkyne&#8208;azide coupling (CuAAC), and Ag for the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. The results confirm that the nanocomposites exhibit catalytic activity. Our methodology offers a versatile and easily tunable platform for the synthesis of nanocomposites. Any monomer amenable to radical polymerization can be employed, and a wide range of metal salts can be reduced via the photo&#8208;initiated process. The syntheses are rapid (approximately 10 minutes), require no hazardous solvents or complex reaction conditions, and enable straightforward work&#8208;up.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning of Physicochemical Properties of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes Introducing Fluorine Atom(s) on the Building Blocks Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research has shown the impact of the fluorine atom on changing the physicochemical properties of oxetane&#8208;based building blocks compared to other close analogs and fluorine&#8208;free derivatives. This knowledge can be utilized by the chemical community for fine&#8208;tuning of the abovementioned properties.








Abstract
Fluorinated oxetane derivatives garner significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse bioisosteric possibilities for potential applications in medicinal chemistry. We developed robust methodologies for the synthesis of 3&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted oxetanes, leveraging nucleophilic substitution, deoxy&#8208; and deoxofluorination, as well as fluoroiodination as key steps of introduction of fluorine atoms directly to the oxetane core or adjacent alkyl groups. Optimized reaction sequences enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various small building blocks, i.e., amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc. Physicochemical studies revealed that fluorination significantly impacts acidity, with oxetane derivatives demonstrating the decrease of pKa values on up to three units in the case of replacement of gem&#8208;dimethyl, cyclopropyl&#8208; or cyclobutylidene moieties. These findings underscore the utility of fluorinated oxetanes as versatile building blocks for future applications in drug design and advanced materials.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of NICOL, A Coligand Secreted Protein Mediating Mammalian Male Reproductive Tract Trans&#8208;luminal Signaling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NICOL is a small protein engaged the sperm maturation in the epididymis. The recombinant expression of NICOL is low&#8208;yielding and highly heterogeneous, which retards the precise understanding of the function of NICOL. Therefore, we determined the SS pairings and succeeded in the chemical synthesis of highly pure NICOL, which is useful for the structural and functional analyses of NICOL.








Abstract
The NELL2&#8208;interacting cofactor for lumicrine signaling (NICOL) is a small protein which forms a complex with the neural epidermal growth factor&#8211;like like 2 (NELL2) and engaged in sperm maturation in the epididymis. At present, the recombinant expression of NICOL is not efficient, which limits the precise understanding of the structure and function of NICOL. In this study, we first succeeded in the chemical synthesis of NICOL with NELL2 binding affinity. The synthesized NICOL possesses correct SS bond pairing, and its secondary structure is indistinguishable from that of the recombinant protein, indicating that the synthetic NICOL will be useful for structural and functional analyses of lumicrine signaling.

         <title>Novel Synthesis of the Antifungal Cyclic Lipopeptide Iturin A and Its Fluorinated Analog for Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iturin A is an antifungal lipopeptide with a wide range of applications. In this study, we present a novel synthesis of iturin A via enantiomeric synthesis of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid and on&#8208;resin cyclization. We also obtained the (S)&#8208;epimer of iturin A, showing a dramatic loss of bioactivity, and a monofluorinated analog, which retained the bioactivity of the natural compound and can be a useful fluorine NMR probe for mechanistic studies.








Abstract
The rapid development of antifungal resistance poses a threat to the health and agricultural sectors. Iturin A, a cyclic lipopeptide with pronounced antifungal properties produced by Bacillus sp., holds promise against several pathogens. Here, a novel synthesis of iturin A is presented, which enables access to different analogs for the study of its mode of action. The route includes the enantioselective synthesis of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid present in the lipopeptide structure, followed by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and on&#8208;resin cyclization. This robust synthesis was used to obtain natural iturin A. Furthermore, the synthesis of two analogs is described: an epimer with an inverted stereochemistry of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid, which was designed to shed light on the role of this stereocenter on iturin A's bioactivity, and a monofluorinated analog to assess fluorination's impact on bioactivity and as a fluorine NMR probe for mechanistic studies. Antifungal assays against Candida albicans and Fusarium graminearum showed that the epimer of iturin A lost all bioactivity, while the monofluorinated analog retained the bioactivity of the natural compound, thus confirming its potential as an NMR probe.

         <title>Tuning the 2LMCT Deactivation of Cyclometalated Iron Carbene Complexes with Electronic Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromo&#8208; or furanyl&#8208;substituents on a cyclometalated iron(III) N&#8208;heterocyclic complex stabilize the 2LMCT state to very different extent. With substantially different 2LMCT energies and lifetimes, the two cases illustrate the balance between non&#8208;radiative deactivation directly to the ground state or via metal&#8208;centered states.








Abstract
FeIII complexes based on the [FeIII(ImP)2]+ motif (ImP&#160;=&#160;bis(2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenylene)), where the ligand contains both carbene and cyclometalated moieties, are a promising class of photoactive materials made from this abundant metal. In this work, it is shown that bromo or furanyl substituents attached to the cyclometalating moiety of the ImP ligands stabilize the 2LMCT excited state to very different extent resulting in opposing effects on the 2LMCT lifetime. For [FeIII(ImPBr)2]+, the lifetime (255&#160;ps) of its moderately stabilized 2LMCT state (1.85&#160;eV) is slightly increased compared to the parent complex (1.90&#160;eV, 240&#160;ps) pointing to an increased barrier for deactivation via the 4MC state and enabling applications as photoredox catalyst. In contrast, the 2LMCT energy of [FeIII(ImPFur)2]+ is lowered substantially to a value of 1.63&#160;eV due to the extended &#960;&#8208;system of the ligands and the reduced energy gap favors internal conversion directly to the ground state resulting in a considerably reduced 2LMCT lifetime of 59&#160;ps. These findings have general implications for design of ligand modifications aiming at extended LMCT lifetimes and/or modified ground and excited state potentials.

         <title>Layer Sliding&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Changes in a Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence color change from blue to green of pyrene&#8208;based HOFs was achieved by the sliding of the H&#8208;bonded 2D network layers. Single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis revealed that the 2D&#8208;layer sliding forms a pyrene dimer, which results in the green color of the HOF emission including the excimer contribution.








Abstract
Flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) capable of changing their fluorescence properties upon structural transformation have gained much attention, while their design strategies have not been established. Herein, we demonstrate that sliding of the robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded 2D layers can induce dynamic emission color changes of HOFs. Layered HOF CP&#8208;tBPy&#8208;1, which is composed of tert&#8208;butylpyrene derivative with four carboxyphenyl groups (CP&#8208;tBPy), transformed to another crystalline form, CP&#8208;tBPy&#8208;2, upon release of guest solvent molecules. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the sliding of the layers changed the pyrene cores from monomeric to dimeric species, giving rise to fluorescence color changes from blue to green. Fluorescence spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystals microscopy disclosed details of the photobehaviors of these HOFs. These results are the first example of fluorescence changes of HOFs due to sliding of hydrogen&#8208;bonded 2D network layers, providing a new design strategy to construct functional fluorescent porous materials.

A series of Pd(II)&#8208;NHC complexes incorporating &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;methylnaphthyl ligands were synthesized via a simple weak&#8208;base method. The catalytic effects of these ligands were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination, and Miyaura borylation reactions. The &#945;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;methylnaphthyl variant showed superior performance, particularly in catalyst activation, compared to both the &#946; isomer and cinnamyl&#8208;based analogs.

The synthesized Pd(II)&#8208;NHC derivatives displayed good to excellent catalytic activity, and rapid activation in classical Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig, and Miyaura borylation reactions.

         <title>Activation of S1PR1 by Ponesimod for Multiple Sclerosis Therapy: Uncovering MAPK and PI3K Pathway Mechanisms and Repurposing Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ponesimod, a selective S1PR1 modulator approved for MS, might activate the S1PR1 by triggering key signaling pathways like MAPK/ERK and PI3K&#8208;Akt to inhibit lymphocyte migration. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of ponesimod in MS treatment and highlights the potential of drug repurposing to advance MS therapy.








Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting over 2 million people globally, primarily causes neurological disability in individuals under 40. This autoimmune disorder involves the immune system attacking the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a promising therapeutic target, with approved drugs like ponesimod acting as S1PR1 agonists. However, the exact mechanism of ponesimod's action on S1PR1 and its therapeutic effects in MS remains unclear. Our study, combining metadynamics, single&#8208;cell transcriptomics, and drug repurposing, shows that ponesimod binds to S1PR1, causing the W2696.48 amino acid to flip downward. This flip weakens interactions within the phosphorylation&#8208;independent binding (PIF) motif while maintaining the N3077.49&#8208;F2656.44 interaction, activating Gi signaling. The downstream effects primarily involve the MAPK/ERK and PI3K&#8208;Akt pathways, which inhibit lymphocyte migration to lymph nodes, a crucial factor in ponesimod's clinical efficacy. Single&#8208;cell transcriptomic analysis further elucidates the regulatory network and pathways modulated by ponesimod in MS. Notably, due to potential hepatotoxicity, we identified valproic acid (VPA) as a potential adjunct therapy through drug repurposing. VPA reduces hepatotoxicity and demonstrates efficacy in treating MS in animal studies. This research provides valuable insights into ponesimod's mechanism in MS treatment and highlights the potential of drug repurposing to improve MS therapy.

The strategy's tunability arises from the sulfonyl radical source, which directs the reaction toward either radical cyclization or cascade cyclization.








Abstract
In this study, we present a green and efficient photocatalytic strategy, where sulfonyl radical&#8208;triggered cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes enables the selective formation of the sulfonylated dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes and tricyclic benzofused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. The switchable nature of the strategy relies on the selective control between radical cyclization and radical cascade cyclization, dictated by the choice of sulfonyl radical source. Under the photocatalytic conditions, selenosulfonates yielded sulfonylated heterocyclic carboxaldehydes, while sodium aryl sulfinates led to the formation of tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Under blue LED irradiation, selenosulfonates generate sulfonyl and phenylselenyl radicals. The sulfonyl radical adds chemoselectively to the alkene, triggering a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to form a vinyl radical, which is trapped by the phenylselenyl radical. Oxygen and EY&#8208;Na&#8322; facilitate the conversion of selenosulfonylated intermediates into sulfonylated 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes. A range of 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes was synthesized using the developed method. Sodium aryl sulfinates, under blue LED irradiation and in the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol&#160;(HFIP)1,1&#8208;Diphenylethylene, react with 1,6&#8208;enynes to afford tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Additionally, the tricyclic sulfone can be readily transformed into a unique bicyclic seven&#8208;membered sulfone bearing an exocyclic double bond. A variety of control experiments was performed, providing important mechanistic understanding of both steps in the transformation.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Structural Determination of the Inositol Glycan Head of Plant Sphingolipid GIPC in Brassicaceae</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental identification of the IG head structure of naturally occurring plant GIPCs in Brassicaceae was achieved through the chemical synthesis of three hexose&#8208;type IGs containing d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose as the second monosaccharide linked to d&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol. Comparison with synthetic standards using analytical techniques revealed that natural IG from cabbage contains d&#8208;mannose with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic linkage as the second monosaccharide.








Abstract
Glycosylinositol phosphoceramides (GIPCs), a major class of plant sphingolipids, are key components of the plasma membrane and play important roles in plants. These molecules consist of a ceramide 1&#8208;phosphate tail attached to an inositol glycan (IG) head, which typically contains an d&#8208;glucuronic acid (GlcA)&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol structure. The second monosaccharide linked to the O&#8208;4 position of the GlcA residue differs depending on plant species and cell tissues. In Arabidopsis, the predominant second monosaccharide has been identified as hexose (Hex) using LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. However, the stereochemistry and anomeric configuration of the Hex have not yet been determined using spectroscopic techniques. In this study, we chemically synthesized three different Hex&#8208;type IGs in which the GlcA residue binds to d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose (Man) as the second monosaccharide. Using the synthetic standards, we determined the IG head structure of naturally occurring GIPCs&#160;isolated from cabbage by using several analytical methods. We successfully confirmed that Hex as the second monosaccharide linked to the GlcA residue is d&#8208;Man with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic bond.

         <title>Engineering Alloxazines by Boron Coordination and Click Chemistry toward Small&#8208;molecule Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of fluorescent molecules inspired by natural cofactors to monitor biological processes carries some intrinsic advantages. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. This work reports easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines (flavin analogues) with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy, which opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing. This molecular approach provides a design concept that could lead to bimodal probes detectable by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy.








Abstract
Selective and strategic modification of redox cofactors offers significant advantages for the design of molecular probes, including high compatibility and affinity. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. However, the synthetic elaboration of flavins and their alloxazine isomers still suffers from limitations. We report easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and explore the impact of core aromatic substitution on their photophysical properties. Further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing.

         <dc:description>
The functionalization of protein N&#8208;terminal positions has significantly advanced the field of chemical biology, enabling the development of therapeutic proteins and functionalized materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current chemical and enzymatic tools available for protein N&#8208;terminal modification, along with a critical analysis of their strengths, limitations, and emerging opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of protein termini, particularly the N&#8208;terminus, has emerged as a cornerstone of chemical biology and biotechnology, facilitating the engineering of therapeutic proteins and functional biomaterials. The N&#8208;terminus, with its solvent&#8208;exposed &#945;&#8208;amino group and minimal disruption to protein folding, provides an ideal platform for the introduction of diverse functional groups into proteins. This review offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in chemical and enzymatic strategies for protein N&#8208;terminal modification and discusses the advantages, limitations, and applications of these approaches. These advances highlight the transformative potential of protein N&#8208;terminal modification in advancing medical therapeutics and biotechnology innovations. Future efforts are poised to integrate artificial intelligence with bioorthogonal chemistry to further expand the toolbox and explore new applications in basic research and drug development.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks: The Use of Modulator for Reversible Bond Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials owing to their ordered crystalline structures, tunable topologies, and high surface areas. Accurate structural determination is essential for understanding the correlation between their structural features and physical properties. This review emphasizes recent progress in growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs via modulator&#8208;assisted strategies, enabling SCXRD analysis and expanding their functional applications.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), notable for their well&#8208;organized crystalline structures, varied framework topologies, and large surface areas, have been actively studied for diverse applications. Their distinct properties are related primarily to their crystalline frameworks; therefore, obtaining accurate structural information is important. Notable advances in the structural analysis of COFs using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Pawley or Rietveld refinement have been made; however, these methods sometimes encounter limitations. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) has been suggested as an alternative technique for obtaining accurate structural information on COFs. However, harvesting COFs of sufficiently high purity and quality, with crystals of sufficient size for SCXRD analysis, is difficult. Significant research on growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs (SC&#8208;COFs) with large crystals using modulators for reversible bond control has recently enabled SCXRD studies. In this review, we introduce various strategies, including molecular design and synthesis methods, for growing SC&#8208;COFs, and highlight several notable examples that leverage precise structural information for specific applications.

         <title>Mechanical Strain&#8208;Controlled Aromaticity in Cyclo[n]Carbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical strain can influence the (anti)aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. While uniaxial tension has a minor weakening effect, radial expansion leads to an almost complete loss of aromaticity in both systems. Radial contraction, especially in C18, significantly enhances aromaticity, offering a strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbons in mechanically interlocked architectures.








Abstract
Cyclocarbons have unique electronic and mechanical properties, but their extreme reactivity makes experimental studies and practical applications highly challenging. In this work, we use molecular modeling to investigate how mechanical strain, including uniaxial tension and radial contraction/expansion, affects the aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. Aromaticity was evaluated using magnetic (NICS, GIMIC) and electronic (&#960;&#8208;EDDB, AV1245) indices to provide a comprehensive assessment. Our results show that uniaxial tension slightly reduces the (anti)aromaticity of both cyclocarbons, with C16 becoming less antiaromatic and C18 less aromatic. Radial expansion leads to almost complete loss of aromaticity, regardless of the initial electronic nature of the cyclocarbon. In turn, radial contraction appears to be an effective approach to enhance electronic delocalization in cyclocarbons, with a particularly notable effect for C18. One of the most significant findings is that an 8% radial contraction transforms moderately aromatic C18 into a highly aromatic system with fully equalized bond lengths, offering a potential strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbon systems within mechanically strained architectures.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we report the thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines using a ball mill with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. The parameter screenings revealed an insight into the reactivity of the reaction. Furthermore, various metal centers and building blocks were utilized to emphasize the variability of this approach. Lastly, a crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine was synthesized with&#160;&gt;99% yield.








Abstract
We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of&#160;&gt;99%.

         <title>Interaction of an Acinetobacter baumannii&#8217;s Membrane Protein with Human Fibronectin to Evade Immune Response</title>

Interaction of a membrane protein of Acinetobacter baumanii with human fibronectin unraveled using &#181;s&#8208;scale molecular dynamic simulations.








Abstract
Bacterial resistance and nosocomial infections are serious threats compromising public health in numerous countries. Acinetobacter baumannii has been identified as one of the most serious pathogens, due to its potential virulence and the development of multiple resistance. In this contribution by using all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation, we analyze the structure and the properties of the OmpA protein, which is present in the bacterial external membrane. We also analyze the structure of possible protein/protein complexes formed between OmpA and the human fibronectin, which may ultimately lead to the immune escape of the bacteria. We provide a plausible structure of the complex, also identifying suitable amino acids mediating the interaction, and thus, constituting suitable drug targets to disrupt the complex formation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Ru(II) and Os(II) Complexes</title>

Readily&#160;accessed&#160;Ru(II) and Os(II) phenanthroline&#8208;pyridylidene&#160;complexes&#160;exhibited near infrared luminescence up to 840&#160;nm.








Abstract
Two Ru(II) and Os(II) homoleptic complexes based on a phenanthroline&#8208;pyridylidene tridentate ligand have been designed to reach NIR emission by combining strong &#963;&#8208;donation, provided by the unconventional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) pyridylidene moiety, with the low&#8208;lying &#960;&#8208;accepting phenanthroline scaffold. Detailed experimental and computational investigations of the photophysical properties of this novel family of cyclometallated complexes reveal emission squarely falling in the NIR domain peaking at &#955;em = 790&#160;nm for the Os(II) complex, while emission is hypsochromically shifted at &#955;em = 747&#160;nm for the Ru(II) homologue in deaerated CH3CN solution at room temperature. Despite the triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) nature that characterizes the excited state in both complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow to ascribe the remarkable optical shift observed in the latter to the larger spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects exerted by the heavier metal.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Mediated Photochemical Reduction of Naphthol to Generate Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited&#8208;state quenching of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol by ferrocene leads to a reduced naphthol and H2 generation. This simple, and sustainable, system is operational at mild applied potentials under photoelectrochemical conditions.








Abstract
The storage of solar energy in chemical bonds can be achieved utilizing more sustainable first row transition metals and organic compounds. Here we show that the weak acid, 7&#8208;bromonaphthol, can generate H2 upon photoexcitation and subsequent electron transfer mediated by ferrocene under photochemical and photoelectrochemical conditions. Evidence is presented to show that near visible, UV&#8208;light absorption by 7&#8208;bromonapthol generates an excited&#8208;state molecule that is reductively quenched by ferrocene. UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy shows the buildup of ferrocenium, and gas chromatography shows the generation of H2 when an acetonitrile solution of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol and ferrocene are irradiated with 365&#160;nm light. This reactivity can be translated to photoelectrochemical conditions. In the presence of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol in acetonitrile, carbon electrodes modified with ferrocene exhibit higher current responses compared to unmodified carbon electrodes at an applied potential of just &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). These results highlight the ability of ferrocene to mediate electron transfer to the naphthol molecule and the possibility to translate this reactivity into photoelectrochemical devices.

         <title>Mass Spectrometric Studies of Reductive Elimination from Si(IV) Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive elimination of ArO&#9472;H (Ar = aromatic residue) bonds from pentacoordinate SiIV is characterized by mass spectrometric methods. A Hammet study of substituent effects combined with DFT calculations supports a stepwise mechanism involving a loosely bound aryloxide/hydrosilane ion&#8208;molecule complex as an intermediate.








Abstract
Reductive elimination (RE) is one of the most significant obstacles to developing main&#8208;group catalysts for bond coupling processes based on conventional oxidative addition/reductive elimination steps. Here, we report an electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) study demonstrating RE from SiIV hydrosilicates [(tmim)SiH(OArR)]&#8722; (tmimH3 = tris(3&#8208;methylindol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane) generated in solution by oxidative addition of phenols (ArRO&#9472;H) to an anionic SiII centre (silanide) incorporated in a bicyclic cage structure ([(tmim)Si]&#8722;). The activation energy for the reductive elimination linearly decreased with the increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the aryl substituents, suggesting that a negative charge develops in the para position in the rate&#8208;limiting step (RLS). In agreement with experiments, a DFT study supports an ionic mechanism in which the formation of an ion/molecule complex by transient weakening of the Si&#9472;O bond is the RLS, as would be intuitively expected from the developing negative charge in the para position. This is a rare example of direct observation of reductive elimination from SiIV to SiII and, to our knowledge, the first involving anionic species.

         <title>Optimization of Prodrug Activation by Enzymatic Cleavage of the &#946;&#8208;lactam Ring of Carbapenems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report synthetic routes that yield prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by benzyl carbonate linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was elaborated to monitor, in a single kinetic experiment, the acylation of a bacterial target (a peptidoglycan transpeptidase) by these prodrugs, the resulting cleavage of the linker, and the release of their warhead moiety in an active form.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics remain the best treatment to fight bacterial infections. Among various antibiotics used today, &#946;&#8208;lactams belonging to the carbapenem class are last resort drugs active against many multiresistant Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Carbapenem antibiotics are prone to hydrolysis by certain &#946;&#8208;lactamases, leading to the opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring and drug inactivation. This mechanism can be repurposed for targeted molecular fragmentation. Here, we report the synthesis of model prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by original self&#8208;immolative linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was developed to simultaneously monitor acylation of a &#946;&#8208;lactam target by the prodrugs and by their sacrificial and warhead moieties. The linker connecting the two carbapenems was optimized with respect to prodrug stability and effective release of the activated warhead upon carbapenem ring opening.

         <title>Probing How Anti&#8208;huntingtin Antibodies Bind the Fibrillar Fuzzy Coat Using Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibodies are widely used to recognize, detect, and target aggregated and misfolded amyloid&#8208;forming proteins, including those associated with HD. Studying such interactions on a structural level is a challenge. Parlato and colleagues report on their use of solid&#8208;state NMR and electron microscopy to probe how such antibodies bind to the fuzzy coat of HTT fibrils, modulating their structure and supramolecular assembly.








Abstract
Antibodies are critical for the immune response and serve as important tools due to their ability to recognize specific amino acid sequences, or epitopes. Based on the latter, they are utilized as diagnostic tools in biological and biomedical research. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by CAG repeat expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and characterized by amyloid&#8208;like protein deposits in patients. Multiple anti&#8208;HTT antibodies are used in HD research for their ability to recognize specific HTT inclusions in both post&#8208;mortem tissue and in laboratory conditions. Some of the antibodies are seen as detectors of distinct structural motifs. However, most knowledge of their binding mechanism stems from studies of soluble monomers or short fragments of the epitopes, rather than the aggregated, misfolded target protein. Here, we investigate how MW8 antibodies interact with HTT exon 1 (HTTex1) fibrils, using solid&#8208;state NMR, electron microscopy, and complementary techniques. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR revealed localized impacts of the antibody on exposed parts of the HTTex1 fibrils: the flanking segments that form its &#8220;fuzzy coat&#8221;. Antibody binding affected the structure and dynamics of the fuzzy coat, but also modulated the propensity for forming supramolecular fibril clusters, which has important implications for (reducing) cytotoxicity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although numerous theories have been widely applied to explain the enhanced OER activity, the mechanism involving spin configurations that tune the OER process remains unclear. This short review highlights some recent advances in understanding spin&#8208;modulated oxygen evolution of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts and provides insights into the fundamentals of the spin effect and design strategies for spin&#8208;modulated OER catalysts.








Abstract
Harnessing secondary energy sources for water electrolysis to generate &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is instrumental in constructing a zero&#8208;carbon&#8208;emission hydrogen value chain. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a bottleneck due to its complex four&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Investigation of high&#8208;performance anodic OER catalysts has developed into a hot research field. The high kinetic barrier associated with OER is strongly linked to the interplay between the singlet state of OH&#8722;/H2O and the triplet state of O2, this interconversion process is significantly influenced by the spin states of metal centers in catalysts. In this short review, the fundamental mechanisms of spin effects in oxygen evolution are briefly discussed with respect to the thermodynamics, active species formation, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, the recent approaches to modulate spin configuration of electrocatalysts are summarized, such as lattice substitution, defect engineering, interface regulation, ligand adsorption, and size modulation. In the last section, the challenges and perspectives for future development of spin&#8208;related catalysis are discussed, aiming to provide insights into spin effects in water oxidation and guidance for designing efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>Nanobodies in Immunoanalysis: From Molecular Engineering to Advanced Detection Strategies for Foodborne Natural Toxins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging nanobody&#8208;based immunoassays, from fundamental nanobodies to advanced applications in natural toxin detection.








Abstract
Natural toxins in food pose significant health risks, such as cancer, deformities, etc., demanding efficient and accurate surveillance techniques. Immunoassays become reliable alternatives to traditional chromatographic technologies for rapid, routine, and large&#8208;scale detection of natural toxins, but their performance depends highly on antibodies used, which are limited by stability issues and productions challenge. Nanobodies (Nbs) overcome these limitations, enhancing immunoassay sensitivity, specificity, and practicality for low&#8208;abundance toxin detection due to their good penetration/binding ability, inherent stability, and scalable production. This review offers a comprehensive, bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging Nb&#8208;based immunoassays, from foundational Nbs to advanced applications in natural toxin detection. The bioactivity of Nbs was summarized, focusing on their structural and functional characteristics critical for advancing immunoassays. Subsequently, the advanced methods for their screening, expression, and purification were outlined. Based on the natural toxins they target, both conventional and innovative Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are reviewed, in which corresponding Nbs modification strategies are highlighted for improving the affinity and sensitivity. The current challenges, potential strategies, and future opportunities for developing and applying Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are also discussed in natural toxin detection. This review, bridging fundamental Nb advances and immunoassay innovation, offers valuable perspectives to guide future development of Nb&#8208;based detection platforms.

         <title>Clickable Pyclen&#8208;Based Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes: Application to Two&#8208;Photon Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents two pyclen&#8208;based lanthanide complexes (Eu3+ and Sm3+) bearing an alkynyl&#8208;linker dedicated to bioconjugation. Featuring strong luminescence and two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption, they were conjugated to a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide thanks to copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The resulting luminescent conjugates reach efficiently the cytosol of living HeLa cells and allow two&#8208;photon microscopy imaging at low concentrations, down to 50&#160;nM&#160;in the case of Eu3+.








Abstract
Lanthanide luminescent bioprobes incorporating a reactive group for the functionalization of biomolecules via click chemistry are of high interest for the straightforward preparation of smart luminescent tools for biological imaging and sensing applications. This article describes the synthesis and the photophysical properties of two lanthanide complexes based on the pyclen macrocycle bearing a terminal alkyne group on its pyridine moiety and a 4&#8208;(4&#8208;alkylthiophenyl)picolinate charge transfer chromophore to sensitize the lanthanide luminescence. The Eu3+ and Sm3+ complexes show excellent two&#8208;photon absorption and emission properties. These complexes were conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide bearing an azide via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The resulting conjugates exhibit luminescence properties comparable to those of the parent alkyne&#8208;complex. Two&#8208;photon microscopy imaging of live HeLa cells was performed with both the Eu3+ and the Sm3+ conjugates. These bioprobes are efficiently delivered to the cytosol of the living cells. The Eu3+ luminescence was detected in cells even at very low incubation concentration (50&#160;nM) and the Sm3+ complex gave excellent quality images despite a low emission quantum yield (&lt; 1&#160;%).

         <title>A Water Stable U(IV) Complex Based on a Macrocyclic Ligand Displaying NIR Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable U(IV) complex is obtained by coordination of U(IV) with a nonadentate macrocyclic ligand based on a triazacyclononane platform. The U(IV) cation is fully protected from coordination of water molecules, and upon excitation into the UV&#8208;Visible region, the complex displays an unprecedented NIR emission from U(IV).








Abstract
Complexation of U(IV) by encapsulation into the cavity of a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclonane (tacn) macrocycle functionalized by phosphonated pyridyl arms affords a water&#8208;stable and soluble [U(IV)L] complex. The coordination process was monitored by electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy and the corresponding complex was characterized by 1H&#8208;, 13C&#8208; and 31P&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling shows the cation to be embedded into the cavity of the nonadentate ligand, as confirmed by analysis of the paramagnetic contributions of U(IV) on the chemical shifts of the proton nuclei. This effective chelation enabled the observation of a broad NIR emission band centered at 1080&#160;nm observed for the first time in addition to UV&#8208;visible emission arising from the U(IV) cation upon electronic excitation in the UV&#8208;blue region. The [U(IV)L] complex was shown to be hydrolytically stable for several weeks in aqueous solutions over a broad range of pH values (from 1.6 to 10) under aerobic conditions.

         <title>Effective RNA Complexation by [2]Catenanes Confers Enhanced Resistance to Enzymatic Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based cationic [2]catenanes are resistant to proteases and efficiently complex siRNA, providing protection from degradation by nucleases.








Abstract
Cationic [2]catenanes bearing l&#8208;arginine residues were synthesized via dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly in water. These peptide&#8208;based mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit proteolytic stability, efficiently complex small&#8208;interfering RNA (siRNA), and protect it from nuclease degradation. Their performance in siRNA binding is attributed to multivalency and preorganization enforced by the mechanical bond.

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2-amino-4-pyridyloxenium cation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes Containing Bifluorenylidene Units via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki Coupling/Heck Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>
