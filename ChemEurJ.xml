      <title>Regioselective intramolecular allene amidation enabled by an EDA complex</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of radicals to unsaturated precursors is a powerful tool for the synthesis of both carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic organic building blocks. The recent advent of mild ways to generate N &#8208;centered radicals has reignited interest in exploiting highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselective transformations that employ these reactive intermediates.

      <title>Biosynthetic Approaches Towards the Design of Artificial Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable form of fuel that can minimize our heavy dependence on fossil fuels as the primary energy source. The need of finding greener ways to generate H  2  gas has ignited interest in the research community to synthesize catalysts that can produce H  2  gas by the reduction of H  +  . The natural H  2  producing enzymes hydrogenases have served as an inspiration to produce catalytic metal centers akin to these native enzymes. In this article we describe recent advances in the design of a unique class of artificial hydrogen evolving catalysts that combine the features of the active site metal(s) surrounded by a polypeptide component. The examples of these biosynthetic catalysts discussed here include i) assemblies of synthetic cofactors with native proteins; ii) peptide&#8208;appended synthetic complexes; iii) substitution of native cofactors with non&#8208;native macrocyclic cofactors; iv) metal substitution from rubredoxin; and v) a reengineered Cu storage protein into a Ni binding protein.

The latter enabled the observation of the 3MLCT state and the spectral features of the penta&#8208;coordinated intermediate [Ru(bpy)  2  (DMAP)]  2+  . The released DMAP catalyzes the acetylation of a wide range of benzyl alcohols with chemical yields of up to 99%.

      <title>The dimeric form of 1,3&#8208;diaminoisoquinoline derivative rescued the mis&#8208;splicing of Atp2a1 and Clcn1 genes in myotonic dystrophy type 1 mouse model</title>
      <dc:description>Expanded CUG repeat RNA in the dystrophia myotonia protein kinase (DMPK) gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and sequesters RNA processing proteins, such as the splicing factor muscleblind&#8208;like 1 protein (MBNL1). Sequestration of splicing factors results in the mis&#8208;splicing of some pre&#8208;mRNAs. Small molecules that rescue the mis&#8208;splicing in the DM1 cells have drawn attention as potential drugs to treat DM1. Herein we report a new molecule JM642 consisted of two 1,3&#8208;diaminoisoquinoline chromophores having an auxiliary aromatic unit at the C5 position. JM642 alternates the splicing pattern of the pre&#8208;mRNA of the Ldb3 gene in the DM1 cell model and Clcn1 and Atp2a1 genes in the DM1 mouse model.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Expanded CUG repeat RNA in the dystrophia myotonia protein kinase (DMPK) gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and sequesters RNA processing proteins, such as the splicing factor muscleblind&#8208;like 1 protein (MBNL1). Sequestration of splicing factors results in the mis&#8208;splicing of some pre&#8208;mRNAs. Small molecules that rescue the mis&#8208;splicing in the DM1 cells have drawn attention as potential drugs to treat DM1. Herein we report a new molecule JM642 consisted of two 1,3&#8208;diaminoisoquinoline chromophores having an auxiliary aromatic unit at the C5 position. JM642 alternates the splicing pattern of the pre&#8208;mRNA of the Ldb3 gene in the DM1 cell model and Clcn1 and Atp2a1 genes in the DM1 mouse model. In vitro binding analysis by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay to the r(CUG) repeat and disruption of ribonuclear foci in the DM1 cell model suggested the binding of JM642 to the expanded r(CUG) repeat in vivo, eventually rescue the mis&#8208;splicing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Exploring Multi&#8208;Subsite Binding Pockets in Proteins: DEEP&#8208;STD NMR Fingerprinting and Molecular Dynamics Unveil a Cryptic Subsite at the GM1 Binding Pocket of Cholera Toxin B</title>
      <dc:description>Ligand&#8208;based NMR techniques to study protein&#8208;ligand interactions are potent tools in drug design. STD NMR stands out as one of the most versatile, allowing screening of fragments libraries and providing structural information on binding modes.

To that aim, we present the synthesis of a set of new ligands which have been subject to a thorough study of their interactions with CTB by WAC and NMR. Remarkably, the combination of DEEP&#8208;STD NMR fingerprinting and Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics has proved to be an excellent approach to explore the geometry, flexibility, and ligand occupancy of multi&#8208;subsite binding pockets.

      <title>P450J&#945; &#8208; A new, robust and  &#945;&#8208;selective fatty acid hydroxylase displaying unexpected 1&#8208;alkene formation</title>
      <dc:description>Oxyfunctionalization of fatty acids (FAs) is a key step in the design of novel synthetic pathways for bio&#8208;based/bio&#8208;degradable polymers, surfactants and fuels. Here, we show the isolation and characterization of a robust FA &#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (P450  J&#945;  ) which catalyses the selective conversion of a broad range of FAs (C6:0&#8208;C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) with H  2  O  2  as oxidant. Under optimized reaction conditions P450  J&#945;  yields &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids all with &gt;95% regioselectivity, high specific activity (up to 15.2 U mg  &#8208;1  ) and efficient coupling of oxidant to product (up to 85%). Lauric acid (C12:0) turned out to be an excellent substrate with respect to productivity (TON = 394 min  &#8208;1  ). On preparative scale, conversion of C12:0 reached 83% (0.9 g L  &#8208;1  ) when supplementing H  2  O  2  in fed&#8208;batch mode. Under similar conditions P450  J&#945;  allowed further the first biocatalytic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of oleic acid (88% conversion on 100 mL scale) at high selectivity and in good yields (1.1 g L  &#8208;1  ; 79% isolated yield). Unexpectedly, P450  J&#945;  displayed also 1&#8208;alkene formation from shorter chain FAs (&#8804; C10:0) showing that oxidative decarboxylation is more widely distributed across this enzyme family than reported previously.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the outcome&#160;of enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic cyclodextrin libraries to&#160;enhance&#160;template effects</title>
      <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic combinatorial chemistry combines the concept of thermodynamically controlled covalent self&#8208;assembly with the inherent biological relevance of enzymatic transformations. We explore a system of interconverting cyclodextrins wherein the glycosidic linkage is rendered dynamic by the action of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase). We report that external factors, such as pH, temperature, solvent, and salinity can be modulated to influence the composition of the dynamic cyclodextrin library. Dynamic libraries of cyclodextrins (CDs) could be obtained in wide ranges of pH (5.0 &#8208; &#160;9.0), temperature (5 &#8208;&#160;37 &#186;C), and salinity (up to 7.5 M NaNO  3  ), and with high organic solvent content (50% by volume of ethanol), showing that enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic systems can be robust and not limited to physiological conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strategic choice of reaction conditions can enhance template effects, in this case, to achieve highly selective production &#945;&#8208;CD, an otherwise challenging target due to competition from the structurally similar&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic combinatorial chemistry combines the concept of thermodynamically controlled covalent self&#8208;assembly with the inherent biological relevance of enzymatic transformations. We explore a system of interconverting cyclodextrins wherein the glycosidic linkage is rendered dynamic by the action of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase). We report that external factors, such as pH, temperature, solvent, and salinity can be modulated to influence the composition of the dynamic cyclodextrin library. Dynamic libraries of cyclodextrins (CDs) could be obtained in wide ranges of pH (5.0 &#8208; &#160;9.0), temperature (5 &#8208;&#160;37 &#186;C), and salinity (up to 7.5 M NaNO  3  ), and with high organic solvent content (50% by volume of ethanol), showing that enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic systems can be robust and not limited to physiological conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strategic choice of reaction conditions can enhance template effects, in this case, to achieve highly selective production &#945;&#8208;CD, an otherwise challenging target due to competition from the structurally similar&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stepwise Assembly of an Electroactive Framework from a Co6S8 Superatomic Metalloligand and Cuprous Iodide Building Units</title>
      <dc:description>The design of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that incorporate more than one metal cluster constituent is a challenging task. Conventional one&#8208;pot reaction protocols require judicious selection of ligand and metal ion precursors, yet remain unpredictable. Stable, preformed nanoclusters, with ligand shells that can undergo additional coordination&#8208;driven reactions, provide a platform for assembling multi&#8208;cluster solids with precision. Herein, a discrete Co6S8 (PTA) 6 (PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) superatomic&#8208;metalloligand is assembled into a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coordination polymer comprising Cu4I4 secondary building units (SBUs). The resulting heterobimetallic framework ( 1 ) contains two distinct cluster constituents and bifunctional PTA linkers. Solid&#8208;state diffuse reflectance studies reveal that 1 is an optical semiconductor with a band&#8208;gap of 1.59 eV. Framework&#8208;modified electrodes exhibit reversible redox behavior in the solid state arising from the Co6S8&#160;superatoms, which remain intact during framework synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Miniemulsion&#8208;Based Routes for Synthesis of Metal Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>The use of miniemulsions containing chemical precursors in the disperse phase is a versatile method to produce nanoparticles and nanostructures of different chemical nature, including not only polymers, but also a variety of inorganic materials. This minireview focuses on materials in which nanostructures of metal oxides are synthesized in processes that involve the miniemulsion technique in any of the steps. This includes in the first place those approaches in which the spaces provided by nanodroplets are directly used to confine precipitation reactions that lead eventually to oxides. On the other hand, miniemulsions can also be used to form functionalized polymer nanoparticles that can serve either as supports or as controlling agents for the synthesis of metal oxides. Herein, the description of essential aspects of the methods is combined with the most representative examples reported in the last years for each strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling VIVO2+ binding modes to human serum albumins by an integrated spectroscopic&#8208;computational approach</title>
      <dc:description>Human serum albumin (HSA) is involved in the transport of metal ions and potential metallodrugs. Depending on the metal, several sites are available, among which  N  &#8208;terminal (NTS) and multi&#8208;metal binding site (MBS). Despite the large number of X&#8208;ray determinations for albumins, only one structure with Zn2+  is available. In this work, the binding to HSA of VIVO2+  ion was studied by an integrated approach based on spectroscopic and computational methods, which allowed to characterize the systems even in the absence of an X&#8208;ray analysis. The behavior depends on the type of albumin, defatted (HSAd) or fatted (HSAf). With HSAd  &#8216;primary&#8217; and &#8216;secondary&#8217; sites were revealed, NTS with (His3, His9, Asp13, Asp255) and MBS with (His67, His247, Asp249, Asn99 or H2O); with increasing the ratio VIVO2/HSAd, &#8216;tertiary&#8217; sites, with one His&#8208;N and others donors (Asp/Glu&#8208;O or carbonyl&#8208;O) are populated. With HSAf, fatty acids (FAs) cause a rotation of the subdomains IA and IIA, which results in the formation of a dinuclear ferromagnetic adduct (VIVO)2D(HSAf) with a &#956;1,1&#8208;Asp249 and the binding of His247, Glu100, Glu252 and His67 or Asn99.

      <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching Using Norbornadiene</title>
      <dc:description>Orthogonal photoswitching is a convenient but challenging way of controlling multiple functions in a system by selective photoisomerization of one unit before the other in any arbitrarily chosen sequence. Here we present this concept for the norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photo/thermo&#8208;switch in the presence or absence of a coordinated metal ion. Thus, introducing two pyridyl ligands via ethyne&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl bridges provides a system that by chelation of metal ions, such as Pd(II), has altered optical and switching properties. Mixing the Pd(II) complex with its free ligand furnishes a four&#8208;state system where NBD&#8208;to&#8208;QC photoisomerizations for complexed and uncomplexed species are controlled by the irradiation wavelength and can occur orthogonally, that is, the sequence of photoisomerizations can be swapped. Studies on Ag(I) and Pb(II) complexes, being less stable than the Pd(II) complex, are also presented; these exhibit like the Pd(II) complex significantly redshifted NBD absorptions.</dc:description>

It is found that the replacement of phenyl groups &#8208; attached at the 3&#8208;positions of the pyrazole units in a previous model &#8208; by mesityl residues has massive consequences, as the latter arrange to a more spacious reaction pocket. Thus, the reaction with O  2  proceeds much faster and afterwards the first structural characterization of an iron(II)  h  2  &#8208;  O  ,  O  &#8208;sulfinate product became possible. If one of the three Tp&#8208;mesityl groups is placed in the 5&#8208;position, an even larger reaction pocket results, which leads to yet faster rates and accumulation of a reaction intermediate at low temperatures, as shown by UV&#8208;Vis and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. After comparison with the results of investigations on the cobalt analogues this intermediate is tentatively assigned to an iron(III) superoxide species.</dc:description>

      <title>La3B6O13(OH): The First Acentric High&#8208;Pressure Borate Displaying Edge&#8208;Sharing BO4 Tetrahedra</title>
      <dc:description>
Sharing is caring: La3B6O13(OH) was obtained via a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature route at 6&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K. The compound represents the first acentric borate displaying the rare feature of edge&#8208;sharing BO4 tetrahedra. SHG measurements reveals a significant signal; further characterizations were carried out by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, thermoanalytical analysis, and computational methods.







Abstract
La3B6O13(OH) was obtained by a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature experiment at 6&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K. The compound crystallizes in the space group P21 (no. 4) with the lattice parameters a=4.785(2), b=12.880(4), c=7.433(3)&#8197;&#197;, and &#946;=90.36(10)&#176;, and is built up of corner&#8208; as well as edge&#8208;sharing BO4 tetrahedra. It represents the first acentric high&#8208;pressure borate containing these B2O6 entities. The compound develops borate layers of &#8222;sechser&#8220;&#8208;rings with the La3+ cations positioned between the layers. Single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational and MAS NMR spectroscopy, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and thermoanalytical measurements, as well as computational methods were used to affirm the proposed structure and the B2O6 entities.

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Stabilized Ru0 Nanoparticles: In Situ Generation of an Efficient Transfer Hydrogenation Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized Ru0 nanoparticles (NPs) were generated in situ from tethered and untethered ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes. These catalytically active Ru0 NPs were explored for transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in 2&#8208;propanol. The transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by these NPs possess a high turnover number. The catalytic efficiency was significantly reduced if these NPs were exposed to air or allowed to aggregate and precipitate by cooling the reaction mixtures.







Abstract
Tethered and untethered ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of three untethered and two tethered Ru N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes were also carried out. These RuNHC complexes catalyze transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in 2&#8208;propanol under reflux, optimally in the presence of (25&#8197;mol&#8201;%) KOH. Under these conditions, the formation of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized Ru0 nanoparticles was detected by TEM measurements. A solid&#8208;state NMR investigation of the nanoparticles suggested that the NHC ligands were bound to the surface of the Ru nanoparticles (NPs). This base&#8208;promoted route to NHC&#8208;stabilized ruthenium nanoparticles directly from arene&#8208;tethered ruthenium&#8211;NHC complexes and from untethered ruthenium&#8211;NHC complexes is more convenient than previously known routes to NHC&#8208;stabilized Ru nanocatalysts. Similar catalytically active RuNPs were also generated from the reaction of a mixture of [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and the NHC precursor with KOH in isopropanol under reflux. The transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by these NHC&#8208;stabilized RuNPs possess a high turnover number. The catalytic efficiency was significantly reduced if nanoparticles were exposed to air or allowed to aggregate and precipitate by cooling the reaction mixtures during the reaction.

Go, go Gallium! In this study, a bispidine ligand has been applied to the complexation of gallium(III) and radiolabelled with gallium&#8208;68 for the first time. The resulting complex is stable in serum for over two hours, showing a ligand system perfectly matched to the imaging window of PET.

Abstract
In this study a bispidine ligand has been applied to the complexation of gallium(III) and radiolabelled with gallium&#8208;68 for the first time. Despite its 5&#8208;coordinate nature, the resulting complex is stable in serum for over two hours, demonstrating a ligand system well matched to the imaging window of gallium&#8208;68 positron emission tomography (PET). To show the versatility of the bispidine ligand and its potential use in PET, the bifunctional chelator was conjugated to a porphyrin, producing a PET/PDT&#8208;theranostic, which showed the same level of stability to serum as the non&#8208;conjugated gallium&#8208;68 complex. The PET/PDT complex killed &gt;90&#8201;% of HT&#8208;29 cells upon light irradiation at 50&#8197;&#956;m. This study shows bispidines have the versatility to be used as a ligand system for gallium&#8208;68 in PET.

      <title>Highly conductive cobalt perthiolated coronene complex for efficient hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;bis(dithiolene)  is one of the most promising structure showing redox activity, excellent electron transport and magnetic properties as well as catalytic activities. Perthiolated coronene (PTC), an emerging highly symmetric ligand containing the smallest graphene nanoplate was employed to manufacture a hybrid material with fused metal&#8208;bis(dithiolene) and graphene nanoplate, and it has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy for the construction of multifunctional materials recently. Here, Co&#8208;PTC, a 2D MOF containing Co&#8208;bis(dithiolene) and coronene units is prepared via a homogeneous reaction for the first time as powder samples, which are bar&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;particles composed of nanosheets. A neutral formula of [Co  3  (C  24  S  12  )]  n  is verified for Co&#8208;PTC. Co&#8208;PTC plays an ultrahigh conductivity of approximately 45 S cm  &#8208;1  at room temperature as compressed samples, which is among the highest value ever reported for the compressed powder samples of conducting MOFs. Moreover, Co&#8208;PTC exhibits good electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a Tafel slope of 189 mV decade  &#8208;1  and an operating overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;1  with PH=0, as well as a remarkable stability in the extremely acidic aqueous solutions, which is&#160;the best hydrogen evolution properties among metal&#8208;organic compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Photophysics, Electrochemistry and Efficient Electrochemiluminescence of Trigonal Truxene&#8208;core Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>We synthesized and characterized a series of dyes built from spirofluorene or truxene core.

The photophysical and redox characteristics are drastically tuned by the introduction of thiophene bridge and electron&#8208;donor substituents at their terminal branches. These comparative studies show the essential role of the stability of both radical cations and anions to obtain efficient ECL dyes. The stabilization of the radicals is directly related to the charge delocalization due to the &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the thiophene bridge.

      <title>Synthesis of nitro&#8208;aryl functionalised 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides and their evaluation as fluorescent hypoxia sensors</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent sensors are a vital research tool, enabling the study of intricate cellular processes in a sensitive manner. The design and synthesis of responsive and targeted probes is necessary to allow such processes to be interrogated in the cellular environment. This remains a challenge, and requires methods for functionalisation of fluorophores with multiple appendages for sensing and targeting groups. Methods to synthesise more structurally complex derivatives of fluorophores will expand their potential scope. Most known 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides are only functionalised at imide and 4&#8208;positions, and structural modifications at additional positions will increase the breadth of their utility as responsive sensors. Here we evaluate methods for the incorporation of a hypoxia sensing group to 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. We developed an intermediate that allowed us to incorporate a sensing group, targeting group, and ICT donor to the naphthalimide core in a modular fashion. Synthetic strategies for attaching the hypoxia sensing group and how they affected the fluorescence of the naphthalimide were evaluated by photophysical characterisation and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory. We then rationally designed an extracellular hypoxia probe that could selectively image the hypoxic and necrotic region of tumour spheroids. Our results demonstrate the versatility of the naphthalimide scaffold and expand its utility. This approach to probe design will enable the flexible, efficient generation of selective, targeted fluorescent sensors for various biological purposes.</dc:description>

      <title>An Ultra&#8208;microporous Metal Organic Framework with Exceptional Xe Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular confinement plays a significant effect on trapped gas and solvent molecules. A fundamental understanding of gas adsorption within the porous confinement provides information necessary to design a material with improved selectivity. In this regard, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) adsorbents are ideal candidate materials to study confinement effects for weakly interacting gas molecules such as noble gases.

In this communication, we report an ultra&#8208;microporous nickel&#8208;isonicotinate MOF with exceptional Xe uptake and selectivity compared to all benchmark MOF and porous organic cage materials. The selectivity arises because of the near perfect fit of the atomic Xe inside the porous confinement.

      <title>Reactive compression molding post&#8208;inverse vulcanization: A method to assemble, recycle, and repurpose sulfur polymers and composites</title>
      <dc:description>Inverse vulcanization provides dynamic and responsive materials made from elemental sulfur and unsaturated cross&#8208;linkers. These polymers have been used in a variety of applications such as energy storage, infrared optics, repairable materials, environmental remediation, and precision fertilizers. In spite of these advances, there is a need for methods to recycle and reprocess these polymers. In this study, polymers prepared by inverse vulcanization are shown to undergo reactive compression molding. In this process, the reactive interfaces of sulfur polymers are brought into contact by mechanical compression. Upon heating these molds at relatively low temperatures (~100 &#186;C), chemical bonding occurs at the polymer interfaces by S&#8208;S metathesis. This method of processing is distinct from previous studies on inverse vulcanization because the polymers examined in this study do not form a liquid phase when heated. Neither compression nor heating alone was sufficient to mold these polymers into new architectures, so this is a new concept in the manipulation of sulfur polymers. Additionally, high&#8208;level ab initio calculations revealed that the weakest S&#8208;S bond in organic polysulfides decreases linearly in strength from a sulfur rank of 2 to 4, but then remains constant at about ~100 kJ mol  &#8208;1  for higher sulfur rank. This is critical information in engineering these polymers for S&#8208;S metathesis. Guided by this insight, polymer repair, recycling, and repurposing into new composites was demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Reduce and Functionalize Copper Oxide Surfaces in One Pot</title>
      <dc:description>Benzimidazolium hydrogen carbonate salts have been shown to act as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene precursors which can remove oxide from copper oxide surfaces and functionalize the resulting metallic surfaces in a single step. Both the surfaces and the etching products are fully characterized by spectroscopic methods. Analysis of surfaces before and after NHC treatment by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the complete removal of copper(II) oxide. Using 13 C&#8208;labelling, we determine that the products of this transformation include a cyclic urea, a ring&#8208;opened formamide and a bis&#8208;carbene copper(I) complex. These results illustrate the potential of NHCs to functionalize a much broader class of metals, including those prone to oxide treatment, greatly facilitating the preparation of NHC&#8208;based films on metals other than gold.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Benzimidazolium hydrogen carbonate salts have been shown to act as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene precursors which can remove oxide from copper oxide surfaces and functionalize the resulting metallic surfaces in a single step. Both the surfaces and the etching products are fully characterized by spectroscopic methods. Analysis of surfaces before and after NHC treatment by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the complete removal of copper(II) oxide. Using 13 C&#8208;labelling, we determine that the products of this transformation include a cyclic urea, a ring&#8208;opened formamide and a bis&#8208;carbene copper(I) complex. These results illustrate the potential of NHCs to functionalize a much broader class of metals, including those prone to oxide treatment, greatly facilitating the preparation of NHC&#8208;based films on metals other than gold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Complex  3  activates a C&#8208;H bond of two molecules of benzene to form PhBpin and regenerates  2  and  1  also in a sequential manner. Thus, complexes  1,  2, and  3  define two cycles for the catalytic direct C&#8208;H borylation of arenes with HBpin, which have the dihydride  2  as a common intermediate. The C&#8208;H bond activation of the arenes is the rate determining step of both cycles, being the C&#8208;H oxidative addition to  3  faster than to  2  . Results from the kinetic study of the reactions of  1  and  2  with HBpin support a cooperative function of the hydride ligands in the B&#8208;H bond activation. The addition of the boron atom of the borane to a hydride facilitates the coordination of the B&#8208;H bond through the formation of &#954;1  &#8208; and &#954;2  &#8208;dihydrideborate intermediates.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrophilic Chlorine from Chlorosulfonium Salts: A Highly Chemoselective Reduction of Sulfoxides</title>

The use of highly nucleophilic 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as the reducing agent is described for the first time and applied successfully in the deoxygenation of simple and functionalized sulfoxides. The method is easy to handle, economic, appropriate for gram scale and decidedly appropriate for poly&#8208;functionalized molecules, as demonstrated with more than 45 examples, including commercial medicines and analogues. We also report some competition experiments to define the more reactive sulfoxide and a mechanistic proposal based on substrate and product observations.</dc:description>

      <title>A Dimeric Chromium(II) Pincer as an Electron Shuttle for N=N Bond Scission</title>
      <dc:description>Reduction of the bis&#8208;pyrazolyl pyridine complex [CrL]2 with 4 KC8, followed by addition of one azobenzene, PhNNPh, transfers reducing equivalents to three azobenzenes, to form [K3Cr(PhNNPh)3]. This has three k2 PhNNPh2&#8722; ligands and K+ bound to nitrogens of azobenzene. When the stoichiometry is modified to 1:4:3, the product is changed to [K2CrL(PhNNPh)2], which has C2 symmetry except for the intimate ion pairing of two K+ to reduced azobenzene nitrogens, and to pyrazolate and phenyl rings. The origin of the observed delivery of reducing equivalents to several, not to a single N=N bond, is traced to the resistance of the one&#8208;electron reduced substrate to receiving a second electron, and is thus a general phenomenon. [CrL]2 alone is shown to be a two&#8208;electron reductant towards benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) resulting in a product of formula [Cr2L2(BCC)], where the reducing equivalents originate purely from CrII. An analogous study of reaction of [CrL]2 with azobenzene yields [Cr2L2(PhNNPh)(THF)]. Together these illustrate different modes for the Cr2L2 unit to bind and reduce the N=N bond. A least squares fit of the two singly reduced DFT structures shows the only major change is a re&#8208;orientation of one phenyl ring in order to avoid repulsion with potassium but to still allow interaction of that phenyl &#960; system with K+. This shows both the impact of K+, being modest to N/Cr interactions, but nevertheless accommodating some &#960; donation of phenyl to potassium. Finally, delivering increasing equivalents of KC8 leads to complete cleavage of the N=N bond, and both N bind to three CrII.</dc:description>

      <title>Productive Syntheses of Privileged Scaffolds Inspired by the Recognition of a Diels&#8208;Alder Pattern Common to three Classes of Natural Products</title>
      <dc:description>Identification of a common Diels&#8208;Alder pattern in three classes of bioactive natural products led us to study the synthesis and cycloaddition of a new class of cyclic dienes readily available from   &#8208;unsaturated lactams. A practical and readily scalable route to the parent PMB&#8208;protected 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered   &#8208;unsaturated lactams was developed. These were readily transformed into the corresponding O&#8208;silylated dienes which were reacted with dimethyl&#8208; and diethyl fumarate to yield stereoselectively highly functionalized bicyclic adducts. These exhibited unexpected and versatile transformations upon acid hydrolysis depending on the nature of the dienophile substituents and the acid catalyst. All reactions have been performed on multigram quantities. These transformations provide a convenient, economical, and easily scalable pathway for the rapid construction of functionally and stereochemically dense privileged scaffolds for the construction of libraries of natural products&#8208;inspired molecules of pharmacological relevance.</dc:description>

      <title>Unprecedented Reverse Volume Expansion in Spin&#8208;Transition Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>The current craze for research around the spin crossover phenomenon can be justified to some extent by the mechanical properties due to the decrease of volume associated with the transition of the metal ion from the HS state to the LS state. As demonstrated here, the molecular complex [Fe(PM&#8208; p BrA) 2 (NCS) 2 ] exhibits, on the contrary, an increase of the unit&#8208;cell volume from HS to LS. This counter&#8208;intuitive and unprecedented behavior that concerns both the thermal and the photo&#8208;excited spin conversions is revealed by a combination of single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction complemented by magnetic measurements. Interestingly, this abnormal volume change appears concomitant with the wide rotation of a phenyl ring which induces a drastic modification, though reversible, of the structural packing within the crystal. In addition, the light&#8208;induced HS state obtained through the Light&#8208;Induced Excited Spin&#8208;State Trapping shows a remarkably high relaxation temperature, namely T( LIESST ), of 109 K, one of the highest so far reported. The above set of quite unusual characteristics opens up new fields of possibilities within the development of spin crossover materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Characterization and Lifetimes of Triple&#8208;Stranded Helical Coinage Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
      <dc:description>We report on a series of polynuclear complexes containing a trinuclear Cu, Ag, or Au core in combination with the  fac  &#8208;isomer of the metalloligand [Ru(pypzH)  3  ](PF  6  )  2  (pypzH = 3&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazole). These (in case of the Ag and Au containing species) newly synthesized compounds of the general formula [{Ru(pypz)  3  }  2  M  3  ](PF  6  ) (  2  : M = Cu;  3  : M = Ag;  4  : M = Au) contain triple&#8208;stranded helical structures in which two ruthenium moieties are connected by three N&#8211;M&#8211;N (M = Cu, Ag, Au) bridges. In order to obtain a detailed description of the structure both in the electronic ground and excited states, extensive spectroscopic and quantum chemical calculations are applied. The equilateral coinage metal core triangle in the electronic ground state of  2  &#8722;  4  is distorted in the triplet state. Furthermore, the analyses offer a detailed description of electronic excitations. By using time&#8208;resolved IR spectroscopy from the microsecond down to the nanosecond regime, both the vibrational spectra and the lifetime of the lowest lying electronically excited triplet state can be determined. The lifetimes of these almost only non&#8208;radiative triplet states of  2  &#8211;  4  show an unusual effect in a way that the Au&#8208;containing complex  4  has a lifetime which is by more than a factor of five longer than in case of the Cu complex  2  . Thus, the coinage metals have a significant effect on the electronically excited state, which is localized on a pypz ligand coordinated to the Ru atom indicating an unusual cooperative effect between two moieties of the complex.</dc:description>

      <title>Unexpected Vulnerability of DPEphos to C&#8208;O Activation in the Presence of Nucleophilic Metal Hydrides</title>
      <dc:description>C&#8208;O bond activation of DPEphos occurs upon mild heating in the presence of [Ru(NHC) 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 H 2 ] (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) to form phosphinophenolate products. When NHC = IEt 2 Me 2 C&#8208;O activation is accompanied by C&#8208;N activation of an NHC ligand to yield a coordinated N&#8208;phosphino&#8208;functionalised carbene. DFT calculations define a nucleophilic mechanism in which a hydride ligand attacks the aryl carbon of the DPEphos C&#8208;O bond. This is promoted by the strongly donating NHC ligands which render a trans dihydride intermediate featuring highly nucleophilic hydride ligands accessible. C&#8208;O bond activation also occurs upon heating cis &#8208;[Ru(DPEphos) 2 H 2] . DFT calculations suggest this reaction is promoted by the steric encumbrance associated with two bulky DPEphos ligands. Our observations that facile degradation of the DPEphos ligand via C&#8208;O bond activation is possible under relatively mild reaction conditions has potential ramifications for the use of this ligand in high temperature catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorescent Metallacycle&#8208;Cored Amphiphilic Nanoparticles Formed by &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Host&#8208;Guest Interactions towards Cancer Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>Theranostic agents, taking the advantages of both imaging and therapeutic functions, are expected to develop personalized medicine in which the therapeutic response can be real&#8208;time monitored. Herein, we prepared three metallacycles with pendent adamantane groups via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of Pt(II) ligands with anticancer activities and tetraphenylethylene derivatives with emission. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin which shows good host&#8208;guest interactions with adamantane moieties was added to form amphiphilic supramolecular nanoparticles with the aim to enhance the aqueous solubilities and bioactivities of these metallacycles. Moreover, when rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was used as the carrier, the release of the metallacycles from the nanoparticles could be monitored in situ through the fluorescence changes due to the efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the metallacycles to rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Theranostic agents, taking the advantages of both imaging and therapeutic functions, are expected to develop personalized medicine in which the therapeutic response can be real&#8208;time monitored. Herein, we prepared three metallacycles with pendent adamantane groups via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of Pt(II) ligands with anticancer activities and tetraphenylethylene derivatives with emission. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin which shows good host&#8208;guest interactions with adamantane moieties was added to form amphiphilic supramolecular nanoparticles with the aim to enhance the aqueous solubilities and bioactivities of these metallacycles. Moreover, when rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was used as the carrier, the release of the metallacycles from the nanoparticles could be monitored in situ through the fluorescence changes due to the efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the metallacycles to rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin.

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Coupling Reactions: A New Concept for the Formation of Hexahydroxybenzene</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  For linear and cyclic coupling reactions of CO among others products the formation of the hexapotassium salt of hexahydroxybenzene is in particular interesting. The interaction of metallic potassium and CO offers  via  the assumed K[OC&#8801;CO]K as the result of several carbon monoxide coupling reactions the formation of C  6  (OK)  6  among other products. Up to now only speculations exist about the reaction pathway for these products which were firstly described by Liebig in 1834. A novel concept is suggested which consists of the single steps (  i  ) reductive coupling of CO, (  ii  ) formation of  dihetero&#8208;  metallacyclopentynes (  cis  &#8208;2,5&#8208;diheterobutatriene as formal ethylenedione O=C=C=O complexes), (  iii  ) formation of its dinuclear 1&#8208;metalla&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;cyclopentyne complexes by external coordination of the triple bond and (  iv  ) insertion of CO into the M&#8208;C bond of the formed metallacyclopropene and (  v  ) the reductive elimination of C  6  (OK)  6  . The novel aspect of this concept is the formation of  dihetero  &#8208;metallacyclopentynes (in analogy to the well characterized  all  &#8208;C&#8208;metallacyclopentynes) which were never considered in the mechanism of reductive CO coupling reactions.

      <title>Resonance Assisted Hydrogen Bonding Phenomenon Unveiled from Both Experiment and Theory &#8211; an Example of New Family of Ethyl N&#8208;salicylideneglycinate Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>We report extensive experimental and theoretical investigations on the nature of resonance assisted hydrogen bonding phenomenon (RAHB) and its influence on photophysical and thermochromic properties of the newly designed dyes differing in donor&#8208;acceptor properties: ethyl  N  &#8208;salicylideneglycinate (  1  ), ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;methoxysalicylidene)glycinate (  2  ), ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;bromosalicylidene)glycinate (  3  ) and ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;nitrosalicylidene)glycinate (  4  ). It is unveiled, that the magnitude of RAHB effect fine tunes the strength of the O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N bonding and accordingly the relative populations of the enol,  cis  &#8208;keto and  trans  &#8208;keto forms leading to variation of the photophysical properties of  1&#8211;4  . It is determined, that the electron&#8208;withdrawing NO  2  in  4  amplifies the most RAHB effect causing the breaking of the O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N hydrogen bond and accordingly formation of the dominant  cis  &#8208;keto isomer in both the solid state and EtOH. To this end, the UV&#8208;vis spectra of  1&#8211;3  in EtOH revealed the exclusive presence of the enol form, while the prevalent contribution of the  cis  &#8208;keto form was found for  4  . Furthermore, only compound  4  is emissive in the solid state in ambient condition due to dual emission arising from the  cis  &#8208;keto* and  trans  &#8208;keto* forms, while  2  was found to be highly emissive in EtOH.

      <title>One Terminal Guanosine Flip of Intramolecular Parallel G&#8208;quadruplex: Catalytic Enhancement of G&#8208;quadruplex/Hemin DNAzymes</title>
      <dc:description>Numerous studies have shown compelling evidences that incorporation of an inversion of polarity site (IPS) in G&#8208;rich sequences can affect the topological and structural characteristics of G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). Herein, we explore the influence of IPS on the formation of previously studied intramolecular parallel G4 of d(G3TG3TG3TG3) (TTT) and its stacked higher&#8208;order structures. Insertion of 3'&#8208;3' or 5'&#8208;5' IPS did not change the parallel folding pattern of TTT. However, both the species and position of IPS in TTT have a significant impact on the G4 stability and end&#8208;stacking via the alteration of G4&#8208;G4 interfaces properties. Our data demonstrate that one base flip in each terminal G&#8208;tetrad can stabilize parallel G4s and facilitate intermolecular packing of monomeric G4s. Such modifications can also enhance fluorescence and enzymatic performances by promoting interactions between parallel G4s with N&#8208;methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) and hemin, respectively.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The fundamental concept of effective molarity is observed in a variety of biological processes such as protein compartmentalization within organelles, membrane localization and signaling paths. To control molecular encountering and promote effective interactions, Nature places biomolecules in specific sites inside the cell in order to generate a high, localized concentration different from the bulk concentration.

      <title>Directed Self Organisation Ensued Enhancement of Charge Carrier Mobilities in a Star Shaped Organic Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>Controlled self&#8208;organization of organic semiconductor molecules into specifically desired architectures on substrates of interest is one of the most imperative challenges faced in the fabrication of high performance organic electronic devices. Herein, we report the self&#8208;organization of a star shaped molecule FDT&#8208;8 into a highly favored structure viz vertical stack. Thermal annealing of films of FDT&#8208;8 deposited on PEDOT: PSS coated ITO substrates was observed to assist the organization of the molecules into columnar stacks. A significant enhancement in the hole (~ 50&#8208;fold) and the electron (~ 13&#8208;fold) carrier mobility was observed in single carrier devices upon thermal annealing which could be attributed to the aforementioned self&#8208;organisation. The ability of these molecules to spontaneously self&#8208;organize was utilized to fabricate bilayer light emitting devices.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the self&#8208;organization of a star shaped molecule FDT&#8208;8 into a highly favored structure viz vertical stack. Thermal annealing of films of FDT&#8208;8 deposited on PEDOT: PSS coated ITO substrates was observed to assist the organization of the molecules into columnar stacks. A significant enhancement in the hole (~ 50&#8208;fold) and the electron (~ 13&#8208;fold) carrier mobility was observed in single carrier devices upon thermal annealing which could be attributed to the aforementioned self&#8208;organisation. The ability of these molecules to spontaneously self&#8208;organize was utilized to fabricate bilayer light emitting devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Solvent&#8208;dependent growth and stabilization mechanisms of surfactant&#8208;free colloidal Pt nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) is key to develop materials via sustainable routes. The Co4Cat TM process is a new synthesis of precious metal NPs in alkaline mono&#8208;alcohols well&#8208;suited to develop active nanocatalysts. The synthesis is &#8216;facile&#8217;, surfactant&#8208;free and performed under mild conditions like low temperature. Interestingly, this process is sensitive to parameters masked in other colloidal syntheses. The oxidation properties of the solvent are here shown to strongly influence the formation of Pt NPs. Based on the in situ formation of CO adsorbed on the NP surface by solvent oxidation, a model is proposed that accounts for the different growth and stabilization mechanisms as well as re&#8208;dispersion properties of the surfactant&#8208;free NPs in different solvents. Using in situ and ex situ characterizations, it is established that in methanol, a slow nucleation with a limited NP growth is achieved.

      <title>Transition of 2&#8208;D to 3&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15 by high temperature fluoride addition and its impact on the surface reactivity probed by isopropanol conversion</title>
      <dc:description>We report on a systematic variation of the SBA&#8208;15 synthesis conditions and its impact on the structural and chemical characteristics. An incremental alteration of the hydrothermal aging temperature and time was used to induce first changes of the highly ordered SBA&#8208;15 structure.

Based on changes of the unit cell parameter as a function of the mesopore size, and a feature in the low angle XRD, useful descriptors for the disorder of the corresponding SBA&#8208;15 are identified. An additional analysis of the BET surface area and pore size distributions enables investigations on the structural integrity of the material. Our systematic approach evidences&#160; the identification of coherencies between the evolutions of physical SBA&#8208;15 properties. The obtained correlations of the surface and structural characteristics allow to discriminate between highly ordered 2&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15, disordered 3&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15 and highly nonuniform silica fractions with mainly amorphous character.

      <title>Molecular Bismuth Cations: Assessment of Soft Lewis Acidity</title>
      <dc:description>Three&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth compounds [Bi(diaryl)(EPMe3)][SbF6] have been isolated and fully characterized (diaryl = [(C6H4)2C2H2]2&#8211;, E = S, Se). They represent rare examples of molecular complexes with Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;EPR3 interactions (R = monoanionic substituent). The 31P NMR chemical shift of EPMe3 has been found to be sensitive to the formation of LA&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;EPMe3 Lewis acid/base interactions (LA = Lewis acid). This corresponds to a modification of the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and reveals information about the hardness/softness of the Lewis acid under investigation. A series of organobismuth compounds, bismuth halides, and cationic bismuth species have been investigated with this approach and compared to traditional group 13 and cationic group 14 Lewis acids. Especially cationic bismuth species have been shown to be potent soft Lewis acids that may prefer Lewis pair formation with a soft (S/Se&#8208;based) rather than a hard (O/N&#8208;based) donor. Analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Profiling of A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA Editing Using a Click&#8208;Compatible Phenylacrylamide</title>
      <dc:description>Straightforward methods for detecting adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) RNA editing are key to better understanding its regulation, function, and connection with disease.

EPhAA is synthesized in a single step, reacts rapidly with inosine, and is &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;compatible, enabling flexible attachment of fluorescent probes at editing sites. We first validate EPhAA reactivity and selectivity for inosine in both ribonucleosides and RNA substrates, and then apply our approach to directly monitor  in vitro  A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA editing activity using recombinant ADAR enzymes. This method improves upon existing inosine chemical labeling techniques and provides a cost&#8208;effective, rapid, and non&#8208;radioactive approach for detecting inosine formation in RNA. We envision this method will improve study of A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing and enable better characterization of RNA modification patterns in different settings.</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen Bonded Assemblies of Arylene&#8208;imides and &#8208;diimides: Insight from Electronic, Structural and Computational studies</title>
      <dc:description>Halogen bonding interactions in electron deficient  &#960;  &#8208;scaffolds has largely been underexplored. Herein, we have studied the halogen bonding properties of arylene&#8208;imide/&#8208;diimide&#8208;based electron deficient scaffolds. We probed the influence of: scaffold size, e.g. from small phthalimide (PTMI), moderately&#8208;sized pyromelliticdiimide (PMDI) or naphthalenediimides (NDIs) to large perylenediimide (PDI); axial&#8208;group modifications; varied number of halogens, etc. on the halogen bonding and its self&#8208;assembly in a set of nine molecules. The structural modification leads to tunable optical as well as redox property. The first reduction potential, E  1  1/2  range between &#8208;1.09 to &#8208;0.17 V (vs SCE). Two of the molecules, e.g.  6  and  9  embrace deep&#8208;lying LUMOs with values reaching &#8208;4.2 eV. Gratifyingly, we realized single crystals of all the nine systems, which revealed Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O, Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Br or Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;  &#960;  halogen bonding interactions, with few systems capable of forming all the three&#8208;types. These interactions lead to halogen bonded rings (up to 12&#8208;membered), which propagate to form stacked 1D&#8208;, 2D&#8208; or corrugated sheets. We also identified few outliers, e.g. molecule which prefer C&#8208;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding; or a non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization over the centrosymmetric ones. Computational studies based on Atoms in Molecules (AIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis provided further insight into the halogen bonding interactions. This study can lead to a predictive design tool&#8208;box to further explore related systems on surfaces reinforced by these weak directional forces.</dc:description>

      <title>Flexibility of the CueR Metal Site Probed by Instantaneous Change of Element and Oxidation State from AgI to CdII</title>
      <dc:description>
Relax: AgI activates the transcriptional regulatory protein CueR, while CdII does not activate CueR. In this work the fact that 111Ag decays to 111Cd is exploited, to elucidate the subsequent relaxation at the metal site from transcriptional activator to repressor by PAC spectroscopy. Considerable metal site flexibility is observed, and it is hypothesized that this is relevant to the function of CueR.







Abstract
Selectivity for monovalent metal ions is an important facet of the function of the metalloregulatory protein CueR. 111Ag perturbed angular correlation of &#947;&#8208;rays (PAC) spectroscopy probes the metal site structure and the relaxation accompanying the instantaneous change from AgI to CdII upon 111Ag radioactive decay. That is, a change from AgI, which activates transcription, to CdII, which does not. In the frozen state (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C) two nuclear quadrupole interactions (NQIs) are observed; one (NQI1) agrees well with two coordinating thiolates and an additional longer contact to the S77 backbone carbonyl, and the other (NQI2) reflects that CdII has attracted additional ligand(s). At 1&#8201;&#176;C only NQI2 is observed, demonstrating that relaxation to this structure occurs within &#8776;10&#8197;ns of the decay of 111Ag. Thus, transformation from AgI to CdII rapidly disrupts the functional linear bis(thiolato)AgI metal site structure. This inherent metal site flexibility may be central to CueR function, leading to remodelling into a non&#8208;functional structure upon binding of non&#8208;cognate metal ions. In a broader perspective, 111Ag PAC spectroscopy may be applied to probe the flexibility of protein metal sites.

      <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of Cation&#8208;Induced Guest Release from Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
      <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanisms: Stopped&#8208;flow studies on the release of two organic guests from cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts revealed two contrasting mechanisms. Whereas metal cations Mn+ promote the release of berberine (B+) from CB7 in a multistep process, the expulsion of dicationic dye 2,7&#8208;dimethyldiazapyrenium has a simpler mechanism.







Abstract
The release of two organic guests from cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was selectively monitored by the stopped&#8208;flow method in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts to reveal the mechanistic picture in detail. Two contrasting mechanisms were identified: The symmetric dicationic 2,7&#8208;dimethyldiazapyrenium shows a cation&#8208;independent complex dissociation mechanism coupled to deceleration of the ingression in the presence of alkali and alkaline earth cations (Mn+) due to competitive formation of CB7&#8211;Mn+ complexes. A much richer, unprecedented kinetic behaviour was observed for the ingression and egression of the monocationic and non&#8208;symmetric berberine (B+). The formation of ternary complex B+&#8211;CB7&#8211;Mn+ was unambiguously revealed. A difference of more than two orders of magnitude was found in the equilibrium constants of Mn+ binding to B+&#8211;CB7 inclusion complex. Large cations, such as K+ and Ba2+, also promoted B+ expulsion from the ternary complex in a bimolecular process. This study reveals a previously hidden mechanistic picture and motivates systematic kinetic investigations of other host&#8211;guest systems.

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Thiophene&#8208;based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Heptameric Ligands for Spectral Assignment of Polymorphic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Deposits</title>
      <dc:description>
Head or tail: Distinct periodicity of anionic charges along the conjugated backbone is an important chemical determinant for achieving thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands for spectral assignment of different amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits. Having the acetate side chains of the central trimeric thiophene&#8208;BTD&#8208;thiophene unit tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail instead of head&#8208;to&#8208;head greatly reduced the ability of the ligand to distinguish A&#946; morphotypes.







Abstract
Protein deposits are associated with many devastating diseases and fluorescent ligands able to visualize these pathological entities are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands that can be utilized for spectral assignment of distinct amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates, one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease. The ability of the ligands to selectively distinguish A&#946; deposits was abolished when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species consisting of the same peptide or protein. In addition, such ligands might aid in interpreting the potential role of polymorphic A&#946; deposits in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Head or tail &lt;/b&gt;: Distinct periodicity of anionic charges along the conjugated backbone is an important chemical determinant for achieving thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands for spectral assignment of different amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits. Having the acetate side chains of the central trimeric thiophene&#8208;BTD&#8208;thiophene unit tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail instead of head&#8208;to&#8208;head greatly reduced the ability of the ligand to distinguish A&#946; morphotypes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein deposits are associated with many devastating diseases and fluorescent ligands able to visualize these pathological entities are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands that can be utilized for spectral assignment of distinct amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates, one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease. The ability of the ligands to selectively distinguish A&#946; deposits was abolished when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species consisting of the same peptide or protein. In addition, such ligands might aid in interpreting the potential role of polymorphic A&#946; deposits in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Surface&#8208;Deactivated Core&#8211;Shell Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Simple Ligand Exchange for Enhanced Size Discrimination in Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Site control: Removing catalytic sites near the surface of the MOF crystal allowed for enhanced size discrimination of the reactants thus improving selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive catalyst support for stable immobilization of the active sites in their scaffold due to the high tunability of organic ligands. The active site&#8208;functionalized ligands can be easily employed to construct MOFs as porous heterogeneous catalysts. However, the existence of active sites on the external surfaces as well as internal pores of MOFs seriously impedes the selective reaction in the pore. Herein, through a simple post&#8208;synthetic ligand exchange (PSE) method we synthesized surface&#8208;deactivated (only core&#8208;active) core&#8211;shell&#8208;type MOF catalysts, which contain 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) groups on the ligand as active sites for aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The porous but catalytically inactive shell ensured the size&#8208;selective permeability by sieving effects and induced all reactions to take place in the pores of the catalytically active core. Because PSE is a facile and universal approach, this can be rapidly applied to a variety of MOF&#8208;based catalysts for enhancing reaction selectivity.

      <title>Overview of Synthetic Methods to Prepare Plasmonic Transition&#8208;Metal Nitride Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Standout stability: The search for plasmonic materials that are low&#8208;cost, chemically and thermally stable, and exhibit low optical losses has attracted significant attention. Among new materials, plasmonic transition&#8208;metal nitride nanostructures are promising non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal alternatives.

Abstract
The search for new plasmonic materials that are low&#8208;cost, chemically and thermally stable, and exhibit low optical losses has garnered significant attention among researchers. Recently, metal nitrides have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based plasmonic materials, such as silver and gold. Many of the initial studies on metal nitrides have focused on computational prediction of the plasmonic properties of these materials. In recent years, several synthetic methods have been developed to enable empirical analysis. This review highlights synthetic techniques for the preparation of plasmonic metal nitride nanoparticles, which are predominantly free&#8208;standing, by using solid&#8208;state and solid&#8211;gas phase reactions, nonthermal and arc plasma methods, and laser ablation. The physical properties of the nanoparticles, such as shape, size, crystallinity, and optical response, obtained with such synthetic methods are also summarized.

      <title>Exchange&#8208;Biasing in a Dinuclear Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet with a Large Energy Barrier for Magnetisation Reversal
</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnet: A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet shows a new record of energy barrier for magnetisation reversal for polynuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets. Moreover, the zero&#8208;field tunnelling effect is suppressed by exchange&#8208;biasing effect arising from magnetic coupling interactions between the DyIII centres.







Abstract
A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy2L2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] has been made by using a diamine&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligand, H2L. Magnetic studies show an energy barrier for magnetisation reversal (Ueff) around 1000&#8197;K. An exchange&#8208;biasing effect is clearly seen in magnetic hysteresis with steps up to 3&#8197;K. Ab initio calculations exclude the possibility of a pure dipolar origin of this effect leading to the conclusion that super&#8208;exchange through the chloride bridging ligands is important.

      <title>On the Limited Stability of BDPA Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Instability of BDPA radicals: 1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA) radicals have limited persistence both in solution and in the solid state. Decomposition in the solid state was found to be due to oxidation while dimer formation is a significant pathway of decomposition in solution (see figure).







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA)&#8208;based radicals are of interest as polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). For this purpose, a BDPA&#8208;nitroxide biradical, employing a phosphodiester linkage, was synthesized. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, BDPA&#8208;derived radicals were observed to have limited stability. Hence, the effects of various factors on the stability of BDPA radicals were investigated. Solvent polarity was found to play a significant role on degradation; a polar BDPA radical was observed to degrade faster in a non&#8208;polar solvent, whereas non&#8208;polar radicals were more unstable in polar solvents. The rate of decomposition was found to increase non&#8208;linearly with increasing radical concentration; a 2&#8208;fold increase in concentration led to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the rate of degradation. Collectively, these results indicate that the dimerization is a significant degradation pathway for BDPA radicals and indeed, a dimer of one BDPA radical was detected by mass spectrometry.

      <dc:description>
Fluorescence microscopy images of lysosomal staining with lysotracker in HMLER CD44high/CD24low cells treated with the C20&#8208;cyclopropylamine Salinomycin derivative and a model of its crystal structure. Salinomycin derivatives and DMT1 inhibitors (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000335 and DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000159) selectively target cancer stem cells via lysosomal iron accumulation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid ROS produced via the Fenton reaction lead to cell death reminiscent of ferroptosis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Colombeau, R.

      <title>Enhanced Electrosynthetic Hydrogen Evolution by Hydrogenases Embedded in a Redox&#8208;Active Hydrogel</title>
      <dc:description>
The redox polymer cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) was utilized to immobilize hydrogenase enzyme on an electrode surface and mediate electron transfer for hydrogen evolution. Cc&#8208;PAA has been found to effectively mediate electron transfer between an electrode and hydrogenases at high specificity and efficiency.







Abstract
Molecular hydrogen is a major high&#8208;energy carrier for future energy technologies, if produced from renewable electrical energy. Hydrogenase enzymes offer a pathway for bioelectrochemically producing hydrogen that is advantageous over traditional platforms for hydrogen production because of low overpotentials and ambient operating temperature and pressure. However, electron delivery from the electrode surface to the enzyme's active site is often rate&#8208;limiting. Here, it is shown that three different hydrogenases from Clostridium pasteurianum and Methanococcus maripaludis, when immobilized at a cathode in a cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) redox polymer, mediate rapid and efficient hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, it is shown that Cc&#8208;PAA&#8208;mediated hydrogenases can operate at high faradaic efficiency (80&#8211;100&#8201;%) and low apparent overpotential (&#8722;0.578 to &#8722;0.593&#8197;V vs. SHE). Specific activities of these hydrogenases in the electrosynthetic Cc&#8208;PAA assay were comparable to their respective activities in traditional methyl viologen assays, indicating that Cc&#8208;PAA mediates electron transfer at high rates, to most of the embedded enzymes.

      <title>The Development of Vanadyl Phosphate Cathode Materials for Energy Storage Systems: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
VOPO4 cathodes: Vanadyl phosphate shows great promise as a cathode material for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and types of inserted cations. This review presents the polymorphs of vanadyl phosphate materials, their charge storage behaviors, and the related mechanism investigations.







Abstract
Various cathode materials have been proposed for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Vanadyl phosphate is an important member of the polyanion cathode family. VOPO4 has seven known crystal polymorphs with tunneled or layered frameworks, which allow facile cation (de)intercalations. Two&#8208;electron transfer per formula unit can be realized by using VV/VIV and VIV/VIII redox couples. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and the types of inserted cations. This Review outlines the crystal structures of VOPO4 polymorphs and their lithiated phases. The research progress of vanadyl phosphate cathode materials for different energy storage systems, including lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, potassium&#8208;ion batteries, multivalent batteries, and supercapacitors, as well as the related mechanism investigations are summarized. It is hoped that this Review will help with future directions of using vanadyl phosphate materials for energy storage.

      <title>Synthesis and Assembly of Zinc Oxide Microcrystals by a Low&#8208;Temperature Dissolution&#8211;Reprecipitation Process: Lessons Learned About Twin Formation in Heterogeneous Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Conversion of cobalt&#8208;doped layered zinc acetate into zinc oxide: Twinning is an often&#8208;observed process during crystallization or mineralization of ZnO. However, if minor Co doping of a precursor is allowed, a twin free formation of highly regular hexagonal platelets of ZnO microcrystals displaying piezoelectric behavior is observed. Tessellation of these crystals by the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett technique using n&#8208;butanol is possible, albeit only over small areas, if the surface is covered with a polyelectrolyte prior to deposition. This accounts for a subtle charge&#8208;mediated orientation of these crystals on the substrate. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al.

      <title>Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Fused Heterabuckybowl: Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer and Self&#8208;Sensitized Photooxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Double donors: Heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D1) and tetrathiafulvalene (D2) electron&#8208;donating moieties are fused together through a pyrazine electron&#8208;accepting unit (A) to give a D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 type fused &#960;&#8208;system. This system shows interesting transient&#8208;state dynamics owing to the electronic interplay between D1 and D2, and exhibits protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer and self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation behavior that can be spectroscopically observed.







Abstract
The electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (D1) was fused onto the electron&#8208;rich heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D2) through an electron&#8208;deficient pyrazine unit (A) to give 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d, featuring the D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 structure. Both D1 and D2 play a pivotal role in intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) transitions, consequently 1&#8201;c, 2&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show a broad ICT band at 450&#8211;720&#8197;nm in steady state. They exhibit two charge&#8208;separated transient states, CS1 and CS2, that appear in sequence. CS1 has a short lifetime (542&#8197;fs), and the D1 moiety on CS1 is in the radical cation state with an absorption maximum (&#955;max) at 889&#8197;nm. CS1 then converts into CS2 (&#955;max, 1105&#8197;nm) through an ICT between D1.+ and D2, affording D1(1&#8722;&#948;).+ and D2&#948;.+. Compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show protonation&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer that leads to absorption at &#955;=700&#8211;1300&#8197;nm. Owing to the existence of an electron&#8208;rich C=C bond on the D1 moiety and in situ generation of 1O2 by the pyrazine&#8208;fused D2 moiety, compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d display self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation in 50&#8197;s.

      <title>Diphenylberyllium Reinvestigated: Structure, Properties, and Reactivity of BePh2, [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+, and [BePh3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>
Finally, the structure of diphenylberyllium has been determined and its reactivity explored. BePh2 acts as a Lewis acid but with unexpectedly low ether&#8208;affinity. Several triphenylberyllates were characterized, of which one originates from the selfionization of BePh2. The generated phenylberyllium cation exhibits an unusual 4+1 coordination and all compounds are stable in chlorinated solvents (see scheme). These findings enabled a classification of organoberyllium compounds in comparison to the other (pseudo)main group organyles.







Abstract
The first synthesis of BePh2 was accomplished almost a century ago. However, its structure has remained unknown so far, while the corresponding aryls of the elements adjacent to beryllium in the periodic table are well investigated. Herein, we present an improved synthesis for diphenylberyllium and show by X&#8208;ray diffraction that it forms a trinuclear complex in the solid state. NMR spectroscopy revealed that this structure is also retained in solution but exhibits dynamic behavior. Its stability against heat and coordinating solvents is discussed and the possible obstacles to the synthesis of BePh2 from BeCl2 are examined. In the process of this study two ether adducts, BePh2&#8901;Et2O and Be2Ph4&#8901;Et2O, have been characterized as well as the previously unknown triphenylberyllate anion. From the latter several single&#8208;crystal structures were obtained under various conditions, in which [BePh3]&#8722; is either isolated or acts as a ligand for Li+. Furthermore, the crown ether induced selfionization of BePh2 is described and the resulting [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+ cation was isolated, which shows an unusual 4+1 coordination around the Be atom.

      <title>Recent Advances in One&#8208;Electron&#8208;Oxidized CuII&#8211;Diphenoxide Complexes as Models of Galactose Oxidase: Importance of the Structural Flexibility in the Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>
Galactose oxidase (GO) has been widely investigated in terms of biological and model complex studies, due to the unique oxidation state of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical. Although properties and reactivities of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical have been clarified, details of the roles of the other structural factors in the active site of GO are still unclear. Recent progress of model studies on GO is reviewed, focusing on some new aspects of structural factors.







Abstract
The phenoxyl radical plays important roles in biological systems as cofactors in some metalloenzymes, such as galactose oxidase (GO) catalyzing oxidation of primary alcohols to give the corresponding aldehydes. Many metal(II)&#8211;phenoxyl radical complexes have hitherto been studied for understanding the detailed properties and reactivities of GO, and thus the nature of GO has gradually become clearer. However, the effects of the subtle geometric and electronic structural changes at the active site of GO, especially the structural change in the catalytic cycle and the effect of the second coordination sphere, have not been fully discussed yet. In this Review, we focus on further details of the model studies of GO and discuss the importance of the structural change at the active site of GO.
