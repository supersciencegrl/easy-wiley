         <title>Access to Pyridinyl or Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Tunable Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescence through ICT from 4&#8208;Pyridinyl Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;dipyrromethene boron difluoride (Aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes have attracted much interest in recent decades. In this manuscript, we provide a facile way to access to pyridine&#8208;substituted pyrroles. A series of 1/7&#8208;pyridinyl and pyridinium NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were constructed and their spectroscopic properties were extensively investigated. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed increased bathochromic shift, however, the molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields were decreased owing to ICT effect. The impacts followed the order of pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium &gt; pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ium &gt; pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ium, which was in consistence with their ICT strength. MO calculation was performed to provide possible explanation to the red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission, and apparent charge separation in pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs. The pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY localized in lysosome and potentially avoided harmful "alkalinizing effects" of traditional lysosome&#8208;targeting fluorescent dyes containing amine moiety. We are working on construction of pyridinyl and pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY photosensitizers against microbials or tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer Enabled Homolytic N&#8208;S Bond Cleavage in Vinyl Triflimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. A computational analysis identified triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) induced homolytic cleavage of the N&#8208;Tf bond as a highly interesting reaction type that may be accessible. A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals amenable for a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range&#160;of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionali&#173;za&#173;tion reaction with no need for external CF 3 &#8208;reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Insights of Non&#8208;fused Ring&#160;Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with fused&#8208;ring structures have rapidly improved the performance of organic solar cells over the past five years, but they still suffer from large synthetic complexity and thus high materials cost, one of the major obstacles of hindering their commercialization process. Constructing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) recently have been regarded as a feasible solution due to their facile synthesis and satisfactory device performance. Thus in this concept, we highlight the important progress of NFRAs in recent years, and discuss the key relationship between molecular design strategies and device performance. Finally, we provide some potential molecular insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Phosphorene Sheets and its Energy Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in electrochemical exfoliation of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorene sheets, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. Finally, we also offer our insight into their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Recently, single or few&#8208;layer phosphorene has attracted intense attention due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. To this end, mass production of high&#8208;quality phosphorene nanosheets with specific functionalities represents a pivotal factor for the basic academic studies and practical applications. Among the current synthetic methods, electrochemical exfoliation of black phosphorous is one of the most hopeful ways for mass&#8208;production of phosphorene sheets owing to the uncomplicated apparatus, low cost as well as significant efficiency. Especially, regulating the electrochemical parameters not only induces adjustable phosphorene characteristics but also enables them a promising candidate in energy applications. In this Review, a concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in this domain was introduced, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. At the end, a summary discussion and future perspectives is also provided.

The formation of novel hybrid composites through the combination of the chemically versatile and functional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) family, with ubiquitous, low cost and durable inorganic glasses is explored in this Concept article. The blends and composites created from this combination may serve to minimise, and eventually solve cost, durability and processability issues of MOFs, whilst retaining their valuable properties.







Abstract
Here, we propose the combination of glassy or crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with inorganic glasses to create novel hybrid composites and blends.The motivation behind this new composite approach is to improve the processability issues and mechanical performance of MOFs, whilst maintaining their ubiquitous properties. Herein, the precepts of successful composite formation and pairing of MOF and glass MOFs with inorganic glasses are presented. Focus is also given to the synthetic routes to such materials and the challenges anticipated in both their production and characterisation. Depending on their chemical nature, materials are classified as crystalline MOF&#8208;glass composites and blends. Additionally, the potential properties and applications of these two classes of materials are considered, the key aim being the retention of beneficial properties of both components, whilst circumventing their respective drawbacks.

A consolidated and detailed study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens along with thorough photophysical, computational, and crystallographic analysis has been conducted to uncover the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect.







Abstract
Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, &#960;+&#8208;&#960;+ interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation by Targeting N&#160;Terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards diabetes therapeutic agents: Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;mediated supramolecular modulation of islet amyloid polypeptide aggregation is demonstrated. CB[7] efficiently interacts with different amino acid residues at the N&#8197;terminus &#8220;hot segments&#8221; and alters IAPP aggregation. This type of macrocycle&#8208;based approach has the potential for the development of type&#8197;2 diabetes therapeutic agents.







Abstract
Two &#8220;hot segments&#8221; within an islet amyloid polypeptide are responsible for its self&#8208;assembly, which in turn is linked to the decline of &#946;&#8208;cells in type&#8197;2 diabetes (T2D). A readily available water&#8208;soluble, macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregation through ion&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its random&#8208;coil conformation. A HSQC NMR study shows that CB[7] likely modulates IAPP self&#8208;assembly by interacting with and masking major residues present in the &#8220;hot segments&#8221; at the N&#8197;terminus. CB[7] also prevents the formation of toxic oligomers and inhibits seed&#8208;catalyzed fibril proliferation. Importantly, CB[7] recovers rat insulinoma cells (RIN&#8208;m) from IAPP&#8208;assembly associated cytotoxicity.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Substituted Triptycenes: Understanding the Exciton Coupling of Molecular Switches in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable host system: Azobenzenes have been attached to a triptycene scaffold in the meta position. Isomerization experiments revealed efficient switching of azobenzene moieties together with the build&#8208;up of a cavity in the all&#8208;Z conformation of the C3v&#8208;symmetric trisazobenzene&#8208;triptycene; this makes this molecule interesting as a switchable host system. Moreover, computational studies indicated excitonic coupling resulting in different transition probabilities of &#960;&#8211;&#960;* excitations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of azobenzene&#8208;substituted triptycenes. In their design, these switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp3 center. The azobenzene switches were prepared by Baeyer&#8211;Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to the different transition dipole moments of the &#960;&#8594;&#960;* excitations. Transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered, which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which have high potential as energy or information storage systems, or, among others, in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Electrochemically Assisted Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide to Styrene Oxide on Copper/Carbon Hybrid Electrodes: Active Species and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/carbon paper (Cu/CP) electrode catalysts were prepared according to an in&#8208;situ electrodeposition method. They exhibited high activity in catalyzing the electrochemically assisted cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide (SO) forming styrene carbonate (SC) as high&#8208;value&#8208;added product. Cu2+ atoms served as the active sites, that not only activated CO2 electrochemically but also promoted the ring opening of SO in a liquid&#8208;phase reaction.







Abstract
A novel electrochemically assisted cycloaddition process is proposed, in which highly efficient coupling of CO2 with styrene oxide (SO) can be achieved to form styrene carbonate (SC) as a high&#8208;value&#8208;added product. A series of Cu catalysts with different morphologies and chemical states were fabricated on carbon paper (CP) by using in&#8208;situ electrodeposition, and the sample with nano&#8208;dendrimer structure was found to exhibit a relatively high activity of 74.8&#8201;% SC yield with 92.7&#8201;% SO conversion under gentle reaction conditions, thus showing its potential for practical applications. The relatively high electrochemically active surface area and charge transfer ability of dendrimer&#8208;like Cu benefited the electrochemical reaction.

     alt="Electrochemically Assisted Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide to Styrene Oxide on Copper/Carbon Hybrid Electrodes: Active Species and Reaction Mechanism"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cu/carbon paper (Cu/CP) electrode catalysts&lt;/b&gt; were prepared according to an in-situ electrodeposition method. They exhibited high activity in catalyzing the electrochemically assisted cycloaddition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to styrene oxide (SO) forming styrene carbonate (SC) as high-value-added product. Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; atoms served as the active sites, that not only activated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrochemically but also promoted the ring opening of SO in a liquid-phase reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel electrochemically assisted cycloaddition process is proposed, in which highly efficient coupling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with styrene oxide (SO) can be achieved to form styrene carbonate (SC) as a high-value-added product. A series of Cu catalysts with different morphologies and chemical states were fabricated on carbon paper (CP) by using in-situ electrodeposition, and the sample with nano-dendrimer structure was found to exhibit a relatively high activity of 74.8&#8201;% SC yield with 92.7&#8201;% SO conversion under gentle reaction conditions, thus showing its potential for practical applications. The relatively high electrochemically active surface area and charge transfer ability of dendrimer-like Cu benefited the electrochemical reaction. In particular, the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species that were formed in&#8197;situ during the reaction played a vital role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the proposed Cu/CP hybrid catalyst. Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; atoms served as active sites that can not only electrochemically activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also facilitate the ring opening of SO. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the reaction followed electrochemical and liquid-phase heterogeneous paths, which provide a new green and sustainable route for efficient utilization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resources for fine chemical electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Enantiomerically pure anti N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;azidoacetyl thioimides are efficiently prepared through a direct aldol reaction from N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione and a wide array of aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by 2&#8211;6&#8197;mol% [Tol&#8208;BINAP]Ni(II) complexes. The straightforward removal of the heterocyclic scaffold facilitates their conversion into a variety of chiral intermediates. Indeed, treatment of the resultant thioimides with &#945;&#8208;amino ester hydrochlorides gives access to the corresponding dipeptides as well as the appropriate manipulation of the azido group yields peptidic fragments of kasumigamide and atrutamycin.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric triisopropylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate (TIPSOTf) mediated aldol reaction of N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by a chiral nickel(II)&#8208;Tol&#8208;BINAP complex has been developed (BINAP=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl). The catalytic protocol gives the corresponding anti &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy adducts with outstanding stereocontrol and in high yields. Theoretical calculations account for the stereochemical outcome of the reaction and lay the foundations for a mechanistic model. In turn, the easy removal of the thiazolidinethione yields a wide array of enantiomerically pure derivatives in a straightforward and efficient manner. Such a noteworthy character of the heterocyclic scaffold together with the appropriate manipulation of the azido group open a new route to the synthesis of di&#8208; and tripeptide blocks containing a &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid.

The Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 nanosheets have been prepared through introduction of Ni and Si into the artificial layered AlPO4 followed by exfoliation and crystallization process. The nanosheets has the 2D morphology reserved from layered precursors and the framework incorporated nickel stabilize the 2D structure, along with an extraordinary catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid with O2.







Abstract
Nanosheets of nickel doped SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves in thickness of &#8764;10&#8197;nm (denoted as NS&#8722;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34) has been successfully prepared through a morphology&#8208;reserved method of synthesis. A special aluminum phosphate in two&#8208;dimensional layered structure is used as precursor and converts to crystallized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve, in nanosheet morphology reserved from the aluminum phosphate precursor, under hydrothermal conditions with tetraethyl orthosilicate and templates of mixed amines added. It is found that adequate amount of nickel, &#8764;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%, added to the synthetic system is a key factor for the morphology&#8208;reserved synthesis. By characterization, the nickel is proved to be doped in the framework of the molecular sieve, which more likely helps to balance the high surface energy of nanosheet products. The NS&#8722;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 shows excellent catalytic performance for oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid by gaseous oxygen.

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Diverse Secondary Metal Cations on Redox&#8208;Active Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of secondary metal cations is an attractive strategy for tuning the properties of redox&#8208;active complexes, but work with heavier elements has received less attention than it deserves. Here, a series of complexes pairing palladium with a range of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent secondary metal cations has been prepared and characterized. Electrochemical work reveals that electron transfer to the complexes is tuned by the incorporated redox&#8208;inactive metals, opening new opportunities for &#8220;designer&#8221; redox chemistry.







Abstract
Incorporation of redox&#8208;inactive metals into redox&#8208;active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first&#8208;row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent redox&#8208;inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt&#8208;type heteroditopic ligand with a salen&#8208;derived [N2,O2] binding site for Pd and a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;derived [O6] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox&#8208;inactive metal ions (Mn+). Comprehensive data from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids. This hitherto unexplored reorganization energy penalty for electron transfer contrasts with prior thermodynamic studies, revealing that kinetic parameters should be considered in studies of reactivity involving heterobimetallic species.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold Complexes: The Putative Intermediate in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes Does Not Protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold(I) complexes, the putative intermediates of Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes, were isolated and characterized. Upon titration with different acids, the complexes underwent elimination to alkenes. This behavior was further observed in the gas phase following protonation. Together with CID experiments, the results indicate that the origin of the poor reactivity of alkenes in hydroamination reactions, lies in the uncompetitive protodeauration step.







Abstract
Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center, which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes, which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.

     alt="2-Aminoalkylgold Complexes: The Putative Intermediate in Au-Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes Does Not Protodemetalate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2-Aminoalkylgold(I) complexes&lt;/b&gt;, the putative intermediates of Au(I)-catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes, were isolated and characterized. Upon titration with different acids, the complexes underwent elimination to alkenes. This behavior was further observed in the gas phase following protonation. Together with CID experiments, the results indicate that the origin of the poor reactivity of alkenes in hydroamination reactions, lies in the uncompetitive protodeauration step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au-catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas-phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center, which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2-aminoalkylgold complexes, which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au-catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well-characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2-aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au-catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non-competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au-proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Distortions Promote the Photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclizations of Fluorobenzenes via Machine Learning Accelerated Photodynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning accelerated photodynamics simulations reveal the excited&#8208;state mechanistic pathways of fluorobenzenes. The excited&#8208;state distortions promote the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond during the nonradiative decay. The distribution of surface hopping structures indicates the photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclizations of fluorobenzene originate from the dynamical effects, where the instantaneous nuclear momentum drives the &#963;&#8208;bond formation in the Dewar&#8208;fluorobenzenes.







Abstract
Benzene fluorination increases chemoselectivities for Dewar&#8208;benzenes via 4&#960;&#8208;disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of the experimental limitations in resolving the excited&#8208;state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also currently cost&#8208;prohibitive. We now provide high&#8208;fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C6F6&#8208;nHn, n=0&#8211;3, to study their S1&#8594;S0 decay in 4&#8197;ns. We trained neural networks with XMS&#8208;CASPT2(6,7)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S1 absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04&#8197;eV (&lt;2&#8197;nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C6F4H2, C6F6, C6F3H3, and C6F5H are 116, 60, 28, and 12&#8197;ps, respectively, in broad qualitative agreement with the experiments. Our calculations show that a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of fluorinated benzenes leads to an S1 local&#8208;minimum region that extends the excited&#8208;state lifetimes of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Our analysis of the S1 dynamics shows that the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions promote an excited&#8208;state cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promotes the electrocyclizations.

         <title>Planarized Phenyldithienylboranes: Effects of the Bridging Moieties and &#960;&#8208;Extension on the Photophysical Properties and Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenyldithienylboranes planarized with (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridges, which furnish S&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;S intramolecular interaction, are produced as a core unit for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Slight difference in the bridging moieties has impacts on the packing structures and relaxation behavior in the excited state. &#960;&#8208;Extension at the thiophene rings enables tuning photophysical properties and Lewis acidity of the boron center.







Abstract
Two kinds of planarized phenyldithienylboranes, which contain (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridging moieties, were synthesized. The difference of the bridging moieties affects their packing structures and photophysical properties. In particular, the (CH3)2C&#8208;bridged derivative exhibits a large Stokes shift, unusual for such planarized compounds, that results from a large structural relaxation in the excited state. A series of &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives was synthesized, among which a p&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative shows large solvatochromism in the fluorescence spectra, while maintaining high quantum yields even in polar solvents. The Lewis acidity of the phenyldithienylborane derivatives was also assessed by titration with pyridine. The Lewis acidity of the boron center is affected not only by the difference in the steric bulk of the bridging moieties, but also by the electronic effect of the substituents introduced at remote positions relative to the boron atom. These results demonstrate the characteristic features of planarized phenyldithienylboranes as building blocks for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials.

Copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) have been successfully synthesized and applied to detect various biomarkers. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate their excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity, substrate selectivity and catalytic stability compared to most of the reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors. Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.







Abstract
Though numerous nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities have been utilized as probes and sensors for detecting biological molecules, it is still challenging to construct highly sensitive detectors for biomarkers using polymeric materials. Benefiting from the &#960;&#8208;d delocalization e&#64256;ect of electrons, excellent metal&#8208;chelating property, high electron transferability, and good chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phthalocyanine, the design of the copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) as a colorimetric sensor for a variety of biomarkers is reported. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs are synthesized through a simple microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization, and their chemical structures are thoroughly characterized. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity and also great substrate selectivity than most of the reported Cu&#8208;based nanomaterials. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs can achieve a detection limit of 4.88&#8197;&#956;M for the H2O2, 4.27&#8197;&#956;M for the L&#8208;cysteine, and 21.10&#8197;&#956;M for the glucose via a cascade catalytic system, which shows comparable detecting sensitivity as that of many earlier reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials. Moreover, Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs present remarkable resistance to harsh conditions, including high temperature, low pH, and excessive salts. These highly specific &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine nanoparticles not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.

Experimentally obtained (ITC) and computed (DFT) thermodynamic binding parameters (&#916;G, &#916;H, T&#916;S) are reported for CB7&#8208; and CB8&#8208;complexes with uncharged, rigid, and spherically&#8208;shaped guests. The simplicity and diversity of the model system enabled a deep analysis of the energetic driving forces and uncovered the importance of solvation energies. Electrostatic interactions and London dispersion forces are not the selectivity controlling factors.







Abstract
The rationalization of non&#8208;covalent binding trends is both of fundamental interest and provides new design concepts for biomimetic molecular systems. Cucurbit[n]urils (CBn) are known for a long time as the strongest synthetic binders for a wide range of (bio)organic compounds in water. However, their host&#8208;guest binding mechanism remains ambiguous despite their symmetric and simple macrocyclic structure and the wealth of literature reports. We herein report experimental thermodynamic binding parameters (&#916;G, &#916;H, T&#916;S) for CB7 and CB8 with a set of hydroxylated adamantanes, di&#8208;, and triamantanes as uncharged, rigid, and spherical/ellipsoidal guests. Binding geometries and binding energy decomposition were obtained from high&#8208;level theory computations. This study reveals that neither London dispersion interactions, nor electronic energies or entropic factors are decisive, selectivity&#8208;controlling factors for CBn complexes. In contrast, peculiar host&#8208;related solvation effects were identified as the major factor for rationalizing the unique behavior and record&#8208;affinity characteristics of cucurbit[n]urils.

         <title>The Effects of Ring Strain on Cyclic Tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes has been synthesized. In the smallest of the cycles, the bond angles of the cumulene are distorted to as little as 172&#8211;174&#176; based on crystallographic and computational analyses. Spectroscopic and physical properties as a function of ring size show small but consistent trends as ring strain increases.







Abstract
Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (1&#8201;a&#8211;f) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in 13C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (&#955;max=504&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;a to ca. 178&#176; (&#955;max=494&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;f.

         <title>1&#8208;(Azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;Tetrazole: A Powerful New Ligand for Highly Energetic Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortening the alkyl chain in 1&#8208;(Azidoethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AET) to a methylene bridge results in the formation of highly sensitive 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AzMT), which exhibits a greatly increased enthalpy of formation, hence a drastically increased detonation performance is calculated. Like AET, AzMT can be applied as ligand in the energetic coordination compounds (ECC) of several transition metals, showing the characteristics of primary explosives capable of initiating pentaerythritol tetranitrate. The ligand as well as all ECCs are fully characterized.







Abstract
Highly energetic 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AzMT, 3) has been synthesized and characterized. This completes the series of 1&#8208;(azidoalkyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazoles represented by 1&#8208;(azidoethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AET) and 1&#8208;(azidopropyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (APT). AzMT was thoroughly analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 14N, 15N) NMR measurements. Several energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) of 3d metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) and silver in combination with anions such as (per)chlorate, mono&#8208; and dihydroxy&#8208;trinitrophenolate were prepared, giving insight into the coordination behavior of AzMT as a ligand. The synthesized ECCs were also analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy. Differential thermal analysis for all compounds was conducted, and the sensitivity towards external stimuli (impact, friction, and ESD) was measured. Due to the high enthalpy of formation of AzMT (+654.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), some of the resulting coordination compounds are extremely sensitive, yet are able to undergo deflagration&#8208;to&#8208;detonation transition (DDT) and initiate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Therefore, they are to be ranked as primary explosives.

         <title>A High&#8208;Valent Ru&#8208;PCP Pincer Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Carbonyl and Carboxyl Compounds under Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 38, July 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well&#8208;defined high&#8208;valent RuIV catalyst is described. The catalyst exhibits better reactivity toward molecular hydrogen than the low&#8208;valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent metals traditionally dominate the domain of catalytic hydrogenation. However, metal&#8208;ligand cooperating (MLC) catalytic systems, operating through heterolytic H&#8722;H bond splitting by a Lewis acidic metal and a basic ligand site, do not require an electron&#8208;rich metal. On the contrary, high&#8208;valent metals that induce weaker back donation facilitate heterolytic bond activation. Here we report, for the first time, the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well&#8208;defined RuIV catalyst bearing a bifunctional PCP pincer ligand. The catalyst exhibits reactivity toward molecular hydrogen superior to that of the low&#8208;valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.

Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) self&#8208;assembly is responsible for the decline of pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells, which is implicated in type II diabetes. The macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits IAPP aggregation through ion&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its primary random&#8208;coil conformation. Most importantly, CB[7] rescues rat insulinoma cells (a robust pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cell model) from IAPP&#8208;assembly&#8208;associated cytotoxicity. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Maity, A.&#8197;D. Hamilton, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200456).

Maity, A.&#8197;D. Hamilton, and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202200456"&gt;10.1002/chem.202200456&lt;/a&gt;).

You can&#8242;t separate this couple: One of the azo&#8208;substituted tripycenes synthesized in this work is highlighted in front of its UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectrum. Even though the azobenzenes are separated by a sp3 center, they experience excitonic coupling, as illustrated by the lightning. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A. Wegner and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200972). Design by Felix Bernt.

High&#8208;valent metal complexes are viable candidates for hydrogenation catalysts: The domain of catalytic hydrogenation is traditionally dominated by low&#8208;valent metals; however, the heterolytic bond&#8208;splitting mechanism does not require an electron&#8208;rich metal. Here we report a structurally well&#8208;defined ruthenium(IV) catalyst capable of hydrogen activation at room temperature and the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen.

The formation of hybrid materials through the combination of the chemically versatile, functional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) family is proposed, with ubiquitous, low cost and durable inorganic glasses. The blends and composites hence created may serve to minimise, and eventually solve cost, durability and processability issues of MOFs, whilst retaining their valuable properties.

         <title>Inducing Curvature to Pyracylene upon &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curve the flat! A reliable synthetic strategy for the &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds was established. The evolution of the structural, optoelectronic and redox properties in relation to the progressive &#960;&#8208;expansion was comprehensively studied both in experiment and theory. The results identify the compounds as promising chromophores with multi&#8208;stage amphoteric redox properties.







Abstract
We disclose a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds. The unique structural features of the resulting compounds were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Depending on the extent of &#960;&#8208;expansion the compounds display intense bathochromically shifted absorption bands in their UV/Vis spectra and are prone to several redox events as documented by cyclic voltammetry. The experimental observations are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory, suggesting progressive narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and distinct evolution of the electronic structure and aromaticity.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Interpretation of Interatomic Charge Transfer and Electron Exchange Effects by Combining Static and Kinetic Potentials and Associated Vector Fields
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and consequent electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between the zero&#8208;flux surfaces of atomic and electrostatic and kinetic potential&#8208;based basins. Behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials included in the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied.







Abstract
Intricate behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials from the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied. Channels of locally enhanced kinetic potential and corresponding saddle Lagrange points were found between chemically bonded atoms. Superposition of electrostatic 
 and kinetic 
 potentials and electron density 
 allowed partitioning any molecules and crystals into atomic 
&#8208; and potential&#8208;based 
&#8208;basins; 
&#8208;basins explicitly account for the electron exchange effect, which is missed for 
&#8208;ones. Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and related electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between zero&#8208;flux surfaces of 
&#8208; and

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phenomena of interatomic&lt;/b&gt; charge transfer and consequent electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between the zero-flux surfaces of atomic and electrostatic and kinetic potential-based basins. Behaviour of one-electron potentials included in the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intricate behaviour of one-electron potentials from the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied. Channels of locally enhanced kinetic potential and corresponding saddle Lagrange points were found between chemically bonded atoms. Superposition of electrostatic 
 and kinetic 
 potentials and electron density 
 allowed partitioning any molecules and crystals into atomic 
- and potential-based 
-basins; 
-basins explicitly account for the electron exchange effect, which is missed for 
-ones. Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and related electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between zero-flux surfaces of 
- and 
-basins. The gap between 
- and 
-basins represents the charge transfer, while the gap between 
- and 
-basins is a real-space manifestation of sharing the transferred electrons caused by the static exchange and kinetic effects as a response against the electron transfer. The regularity describing relative positions of 
-, 
-, and 
- basin boundaries between interacting atoms was proposed. The position of 
-boundary between 
- and 
-ones within an electron occupier atom determines the extent of transferred electron sharing. The stronger an H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond is, the deeper hydrogen atom's 
-basin penetrates oxygen atom's 
-basin, while for covalent bonds a 
-boundary closely approaches a 
-one indicating almost complete sharing of the transferred electrons. In the case of ionic bonds, the same region corresponds to electron pairing within the

         <title>Understanding the Reshaping of Fluorinated Polyester Vitrimers by Kinetic and DFT Studies of the Transesterification Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study of a transesterification reaction were conducted in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the reaction rate and provide a molecular model for the observed accelerating effect of proximal fluorinated groups in the reshaping of transesterification vitrimers.







Abstract
Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Following up on a recent report on catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules are presented in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Syntheses of Alkylidenecyclopropanes from Allenoates with Donor&#8208;Acceptor and Diacceptor Diazo Reagents</title>

Chiral ACPs: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alkylidenecyclopropanes from electron&#8208;deficient allenes is described. The methodology, using donor&#8208;acceptor or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex furnished the corresponding ACPs in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The first diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient allenes with donor&#8208;acceptor and diacceptor diazo reagents are described. The desired enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of Rh2((S)&#8208;TCPTAD)4 or Rh2((R)&#8208;BTPCP)4 catalysts (up to 95&#8201;% yield, &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 d.r. and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.). This methodology gave a direct access to ACPs bearing multiple electron&#8208;deficient substituents and allows to further expand the availability of ACPs chemistry. Interestingly, during the examination of the scope of this reaction, the asymmetric intramolecular C&#8722;H insertion reaction into tert&#8208;butyl group was observed as a side reaction with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.

         <title>Synthesis of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) Complexes and Their Use as Precatalysts for the Activator&#8208;Free, Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Carboxylic Acids to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable synthetic N&#8722;H metalation route to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes bearing backbone&#8208;modified (and classical) NHC ligands, carbazole and amines is presented. The CMAs are employed for the first time as precatalysts in the inter&#8208; and intramolecular addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes.







Abstract
A straightforward synthetic protocol leading to carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amido (CMA) complexes (metal=Au, Cu) using a mild base and an environmentally desirable solvent (EtOH) has been explored, with a focus on complexes bearing backbone&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, including BIAN&#8208;NHCs (BIAN=bis(imino)acenaphthene). The novel CMAs were structurally characterized, and gold&#8208;based CMAs bearing diverse NHCs were screened as simple, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;basic precatalysts. The readily accessible complexes display high catalytic activity in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes and alkynoic acids respectively, while the screening reveals the ancillary ligand effect of NHCs in these catalytic systems.

         <title>Cyclic Disulfide Liposomes for Membrane Functionalization and Cellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not just decoration: Cyclic disulfide lipids are reported that enable the convenient decoration of liposomal surfaces with functional molecules; this is demonstrated through biotinylation, which drives microplate immobilization. In addition, these lipids enhance cellular delivery when incorporated into liposomes, as evidenced by dose&#8208;dependent increases detected through fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Liposomes are effective therapeutic delivery nanocarriers due to their ability to encapsulate and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of a wide range of therapeutics. Two primary areas in which improvement is needed for liposomal drug delivery is to enhance the ability to infiltrate cells and to facilitate derivatization of the liposome surface. Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating a cyclic disulfide lipid (CDL) for the dual purpose of enhancing cell entry and functionalizing the liposome membrane through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. In order to accomplish this, CDL&#8208;1 and CDL&#8208;2, composed of lipoic acid (LA) or asparagusic acid (AA) appended to a lipid scaffold, were designed and synthesized. A fluorescence&#8208;based microplate immobilization assay was implemented to show that these compounds enable convenient membrane decoration through reaction with thiol&#8208;functionalized small molecules. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated dramatic enhancements in cellular delivery when CDLs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multifunctional CDLs serve as an exciting liposome system for surface decoration and enhanced cellular delivery.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Supported Potassium Hydride for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature desulfurization is developed based on graphite&#8208;supported potassium hydride. KH/C efficiently desulfurizes recalcitrant alkyl dibenzothiophenes, provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. In addition, KH/C enables ultra&#8208;deep desulfurization of sulfur heterocycles (&lt;3&#8197;ppm [S]).







Abstract
The industrial removal of organosulfur impurities from fossil fuels relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts in harsh conditions (ca. 400&#8201;&#176;C, up to 100&#8197;bar H2), yet desulfurization (DS) of refractory alkyl dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) remains challenging. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) enables efficient DS of DBTs in mild conditions, viz. &gt;97&#8201;% conversion of DBTs is achieved at 165&#8201;&#176;C in 3&#8211;6&#8197;h while the yields of respective biphenyls are 84&#8211;95&#8201;% by using only 15&#8201;% excess of KH per a C&#8722;S bond. In addition, KH/C allows to lower the concentration of 4,6&#8208;Me2DBT in the mesitylene solution from 1000&#8197;ppm to &lt;3&#8197;ppm (165&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;h) and provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. DS of various sulfur heterocycles by using KH/C, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free material based on earth abundant elements, is viable at low temperature and has prospects for the further development towards decentralized removal of organosulfur species from fossil fuels.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Enhanced Lithium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding by Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic Rotaxanes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of selective lithium halide recognition by a mechanical bonded heteroditopic host is achieved using a series of halogen and hydrogen bonding [2]rotaxanes. A co&#8208;bound lithium cation switches on halide anion binding which increases greatly with increasing number of halogen bond donors. Ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding heteroditopic macrocycles, highlighting the importance of the mechanical bond effect.







Abstract
A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion&#8208;pairs. 1H&#8197;NMR ion&#8208;pair titration experiments in CD3CN:CDCl3 solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co&#8208;bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all&#8208;XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion&#8208;pair binding. Notably, ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle&#8208;macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion&#8208;pair recognition in general.

         <title>Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;Pyrroles from Ketones, Aldehydes, and Nitro Alkanes via Hydrogenative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst has been developed and employed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via hydrogenation and subsequent cyclization of nitro ketones. The catalyst was identified from a library of 24 heterogeneous catalysts. The key to our hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is the tolerance of aldehydes and ketones as functional groups and the ability to hydrogenate aliphatic nitro compounds efficiently.







Abstract
Syntheses of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds that permit a flexible introduction of various substitution patterns by using inexpensive and diversely available starting materials are highly desirable. Easy to handle and reusable catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are especially attractive for these syntheses. We report here on the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via the hydrogenation and cyclization of nitro ketones. The latter are easily accessible from three components: a ketone, an aldehyde and a nitroalkane. Our reaction has a broad scope and 23 of the 33 products synthesized are compounds which have not yet been reported. The key to the general hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is a highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst, which was identified from a library of 24 earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts.

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Defects in Conjugated Polymers On&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis not only allows growing nanomaterials that are not achievable by traditional wet chemistry but also, combined with scanning probe techniques, enables the structure and electronic properties to be resolved with atomic resolution. Here, atomic&#8208;scale structural defects are deliberately introduced into an anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and it is shown that such defects may give rise of &#960;&#8208;magnetism. These results demonstrate the potential of defect engineering strategy for fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers.







Abstract
Atomic scale defects significantly affect the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Here, isolated atomic&#8208;scale defects are deliberately introduced into a prototypical anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and its local density of states is carefully examined on the atomic scale to show how individual defects modify the inherent electronic and magnetic properties of this one&#8208;dimensional systems. Scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy experiments, supplemented with density functional theory calculations, reveal the existence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around certain defects, which is associated with the formation of a local magnetic moment accompanied by substantial mitigation of the mobility of charge carriers. While defects in traditionally synthesized polymers lead to arbitrary conformations, the presented results clearly reflect the preferential formation of low dimensional defects at specific polymer sites, which may introduce the possibility of engineering macroscopic defects in surface&#8208;synthesized conjugated polymers.

Abstract
Tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained by tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)2]2. These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and 21&#8208;rhoda&#8208;23&#8208;telluraporphyrin are strongly deformed in&#8208;plane from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of the two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, as studied by 1H NMR and DFT, involving the in&#8208;plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side product detected in the reaction mixture, 21&#8208;oxa&#8208;23&#8208;rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen exchange, occurring in parallel to the tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms have been analyzed. The title 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh2Cl2, in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions lying approximately in the plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh2Cl2 unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetraaryl-21,23-dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained by tellurium-to-rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl-21,23-ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23-dirhodaporphyrin and 21-rhoda-23-telluraporphyrin are strongly deformed in-plane from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of the two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, as studied by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and DFT, involving the in-plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side product detected in the reaction mixture, 21-oxa-23-rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium-to-oxygen exchange, occurring in parallel to the tellurium-to-rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms have been analyzed. The title 21,23-dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions lying approximately in the plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Solution&#8208;Processed Non&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Layer White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Adjusting Pyrene&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;emitting&#8208;layer white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SEL&#8208;WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host&#8208;dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL&#8208;WOLEDs and the development of simple non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting molecules for non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono&#8208;fused one to bis&#8208;fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat  Cmca  space group in single crystal system compared with  P2  1  /n  for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance (e.g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Trends between Acid Dissociation Constants in Protic and Aprotic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>pKa values in nonaqueous solvents are of critical importance in many areas of chemistry. Despite their relevance our knowledge is still limited to the most fundamental properties and few pKa values in the most common solvents. Taking advantage of a recently introduced computationally efficient procedure we computed the pKa values of 182 compounds in 21 solvents. This data set is used to establish for the first time universal trends between all solvents. Our computations indicate, that the total charge of the molecule and the charge of the acidic group combined with the Kamlet&#8208;Taft solvatochromic parameters are sufficient to predict pKa values with at least semiquantitative accuracy. We find, that neutral acids such as alcohols are strongly affected by the solvent properties. This is contrasted by cationic acids like ammonium ions whose pKa is often almost completely independent from the choice of solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved reversible zinc storage achieved in a&#160;constitutionally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid&#8208;scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next&#8208;generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO  3  )  2  nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared  via  a facile hydrothermal method. The as&#8208;synthesized Mn(VO  3  )  2  exhibited high specific capacity of 350 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  , and maintained a capacity retention of 92% after 10,000 cycles at 2 A g  &#8208;1  . It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 600 cycles at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  under &#8208;20 &#9702;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO  3  )  2  nanobelts impart fast Zn  2+  ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.</dc:description>

         <title>New Opportunities for Utilization of the Sulfoximine Group in Medicinal Chemistry from the Drug Designer&#8217;s Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70 years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This minireview highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Cocatalysts for Enhancing Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Performance of BiVO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction is usually limited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron transfer processes of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO  4  ) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO  4  for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO  4  . Six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  PBAs@BiVO  4  photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO  4  alone. Among them, the Co&#8208;Co PBA@BiVO  4  photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO  4  coupling with Co&#8208;Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO  4  , facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO  4  and Co&#8208;Co PBA as well as surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO  4  . Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Enzymatic Features in a Supramolecular Iridium Catalyst by Computational Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;biological catalysts following the governing principles of enzymes are attractive systems to disclose unprecedented reactivities. Most of those existing catalysts feature an adaptable molecular recognition site for substrate binding that are prone to undergo conformational selection pathways. Herein, we present a non&#8208;biological catalyst able to bind substrates via the induced fit model according to in&#8208;depth computational calculations. The system, which is constituted by an inflexible substrate&#8208;recognition site derived from a zinc&#8208;porphyrin in the second coordination sphere, features destabilization of ground states as well as stabilization of transition states for the relevant iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond borylation of pyridine. In addition, this catalyst appears to be most suited to tightly bind the transition state rather than the substrate. Besides these features, which are reminiscent from the action mode of enzymes, new elementary catalytic steps have been disclosed owing to the unique distortions encountered in the different intermediates and transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;phosphine catalyzed reactions relies largely on accessing ever more precisely tuned phosphine ligands via  de novo  synthesis. Late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization and diversification of commercial phosphines offers rapid access to entire libraries of derivatives based on privileged scaffolds. But existing routes, relying on phosphorous&#8208;directed transformations, only yield functionalization of C  sp  2&#8211;H bonds in a specific position relative to phosphorous. In contrast to phosphorous&#8208;directed strategies, herein we disclose an orthogonal functionalization strategy capable of introducing a range of substituents into previously inaccessible positions on arylphosphines. The strongly coordinating phosphine group acts solely as a bystander in the sterically controlled borylation of bulky phosphines, and the resulting borylated phosphines serve as the supporting ligand for palladium during diversification via phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) ionic liquids with more than one metal: the effect of bromide vs. chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fifteen  N  &#8208;butylpyridinium salts, including five monometallic [C  4  Py]  2  [MBr  4  ] and ten bimetallic [C  4  Py]  2  [M  0.5  a  M  0.5  b  Br  4  ] (M = Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn), were synthesized. Their structure and their thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#176;C. Powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3 V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10  &#8208;4  and 10  &#8208;8  S cm  &#8208;1  . At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10  &#8208;2  S cm  &#8208;1  at 70&#176;C. The article also compares the structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs with previous examples using chloride ligands and illustrates differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ferroelastics have received particular attention for potential applications in mechanical switches, shape memory, energy conversion, information processing, and solar cells, by taking advantages of their low&#8208;cost, light&#8208;weight, easy preparation, and mechanical flexibility. The unique structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be a design platform for symmetry breaking&#8208;associated order&#8208;disorder in lattice, thereby possessing great potential for ferroelastic phase transition. Herein, we review the research progress of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics in recent years, focusing on the crystal structures, dimensions, phase transitions and ferroelastic properties. In view of the few reports on molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastics, we look forward to the structural design strategies of molecular ferroelastic materials, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastic materials in the future. This review will have positive guiding significance for the synthesis and future exploration of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid molecular ferroelastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry of pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and related analogs: from synthesis to applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF  5  )&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF  5  )-containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine-containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8211;F, and C&#8211;SF  5  bond formation as well as the use of SF  5  -containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway-to-heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise-inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago.

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended&#160;0&#8208;, 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, and 3&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>

         <dc:description>Layered (2&#8208;D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated via atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer scale, magnetically ordered layers separated via a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and their applications and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0&#8208;D) as well as extended chain (1&#8208;D) and 3&#8208;D extended network structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unified Approach to Diverse Fused Fragments via Catalytic Dehydrative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to diverse polycyclic scaffolds via an efficient calcium catalyzed dehydration&#8208;cyclization strategy is described. This approach provides a range of small molecule fragments bearing a range of medicinally relevant functional groups. Both Lewis and Bronsted acid pathways are in use, with the ability to fine tune the reactivity depending on the choice of solvent.







Abstract
A range of highly functionalized polycyclic fragments have been synthesized, employing a catalytic dehydrative cyclization. A range of nucleophiles are shown to be successful, with the reaction producing numerous high value motifs.

         <title>Synergistic Strategies in Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Come together: Asymmetric aminocatalysis plays a pivotal role on the development in stereoselective transformations, synergistically combined with organo&#8208;, metal, photoredox and electrocatalysis. In this scenario, the HOMO&#8208;raising and LUMO&#8208;lowering activation of carbonyl compounds open new gateways to complex architectures and new sustainable reactivities. Last but not least, this research area will keep driving the development of the whole organocatalysis, toward its synergistic combination with other activation strategies.







Abstract
Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activation of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds through HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by a deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of this review is to cover recent developments in synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.

         <dc:description>
An entirely new displacement system based on anomeric DNA without toehold was designed and its applicability was demonstrated. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. During displacement strand orientation changed from antiparallel in &#946;&#8208;D DNA to parallel in &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D DNA and back to antiparallel in &#945;/&#945;&#8208;D DNA. Reaction progress was visualized by fluorescence change using the intercalator ethidium bromide as sensor.







Abstract
DNA strand displacement is a technique to exchange one strand of a double stranded DNA by another strand (invader). It is an isothermal, enzyme free method driven by single stranded overhangs (toeholds) and is employed in DNA amplification, mismatch detection and nanotechnology. We discovered that anomeric (&#945;/&#946;) DNA can be used for heterochiral strand displacement. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. Single stranded &#945;&#8208;D DNA acts as invader. Herein, new anomeric displacement systems with and without toeholds were designed. Due to their resistance against enzymatic degradation, the systems are applicable to living cells. The light&#8208;up intercalator ethidium bromide is used as fluorescence sensor to follow the progress of displacement. Anomeric DNA displacement shows benefits over canonical DNA in view of toehold free displacement and simple detection by ethidium bromide.

         <title>Progress in Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on convergent paired electrolysis has been summarized in this concept article. Four strategies based upon metal catalysis, persistent radical effects, microfluidic chemistry, and alternating current electrolysis are discussed in relation to their underlying mechanisms.







Abstract
Convergent paired electrolysis combines both anodic and cathodic reactions simultaneously in an electrochemical transformation. It provides a highly energy&#8208;efficient and divergent approach to conventionally challenging and useful structures. However, the physical separation of the two half&#8208;electrode reactions makes it extremely difficult to couple the intermediates arising from the two electrodes. In this concept article, four strategies used in convergent paired electrolysis will be discussed from the perspective of the reaction mechanism: a) metal&#8208;catalyzed convergent paired electrolysis, b) convergent paired electrolysis enabled by persistent radical effects, c) microfluidic chemistry applied to convergent paired electrolysis, and d) alternating current electrolysis.

         <title>Autotuning of Vibrational Strong Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actuatable Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavities allow site&#8208;selective organic reaction under vibrational strong coupling. The piezoelectric actuators with a computer&#8208;controlled feedback loop are installed in the FP cavity, which enables accurate retuning of the cavity mode in response to refractive index changes within the cavity. Thanks to the autotuning of cavity mode, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved, despite the respective reactive carbonyl stretches being energetically close.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemistry opens new paths for the synthesis of technologically important molecules. When a reactant is placed inside a Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavity, energy exchange between molecular vibrations and resonant cavity photons results in vibrational strong coupling (VSC). VSC has recently been implicated in modified chemical reactivity at specific reactive sites. However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50&#8201;% improvement in site&#8208;selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.

         <title>Chemically Laminated 2D Bis(terpyridine)metal Polymer Films: Formation Mechanism at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface and Redox Rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox rectifiers: Heterolaminated 2D coordination polymer films were synthesized at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface, and the mechanism of film growth was revealed. The bilayer films show unique redox behavior based on the electron transfer mediation in an electrolyte solution and stable rectification characteristics when the film is sandwiched by electrodes in a dry state.







Abstract
Recent studies on molecular 2D materials with high tunability of structure and function have focused mostly on the discovery of new precursors. Here, we demonstrate a facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of laminated 2D coordination polymer films comprising bis(terpyridine)iron and cobalt at a water/dichloromethane interface. Cross&#8208;sectional elemental mapping unveiled the stratum&#8208;like structure of the film and revealed that the second layer grows to the dichloromethane side below the first layer. Cyclic voltammetry clarified that the bottom layer mediates charge transfer between the top layer and the substrate in a narrow potential region of mixed&#8208;valence states. Furthermore, the bilayer film sandwiched by electrodes in a dry condition shows stable rectification character, and the barrier voltage corresponds to the redox potential difference between the two layers. This study introduces a new strategy for polymer design to explore the materials science of molecular 2D materials.

         <title>Recyclable Mn(I) Catalysts for Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Mechanistic, DFT and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic and DFT studies on a series of recyclable Mn(I) complexes disclosed six vital factors determining their activities along with the existence of different mechanisms for asymmetric direct and transfer hydrogenations. Moreover, Mn(I) complex 2&#8201;b (cat. loading: 0.4&#8208;1&#8197;mol%) performs base&#8208;free transfer hydrogenation of alkyl ketones ketones with enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process has been discovered for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover.







Abstract
We report here a mechanistic, DFT and catalytic study on a series of Mn(I) complexes 1, 2(a&#8211;d), 3, 4. The studies apprehended the requirements for Mn(I) complexes to be active in both asymmetric direct (AH) and transfer hydrogenations (ATH). The investigations disclosed 6 vital factors accelerating the formation of a resting species, which plays a significant role in lowering the activities of the Mn(I) complex 1 in ATH and AH, respectively. In addition, we also report here a base free Mn(I) catalyzed ATH of aryl alkyl ketones with high enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and improved activity. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover has been discovered. Notably, the studies provide evidence for the existence of two different temperature dependent mechanisms for AH and ATH, in contrast to previous studies on related systems.

         <dc:description>
Because of its large size and its optimized covalency toward heterocyclic N&#8208;donor atoms, the intermediate [AgIL]+ unit (depicted as a paraglider) is eager to catch a second &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diimine ligands coming down from the summit of positive allosteric cooperativity. The final stable [AgIL2]+ complex reaches the Valley of Stability. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Zare, C. Piguet, E.&#8197;C. Constable et&#8197;al.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich EDOT Linkers in Tetracationic bis&#8208;Triarylborane Chromophores: Influence on Water Stability, Biomacromolecule Sensing, and Photoinduced Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with EDOT linkers, show red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;linked analogues, with one derivative emitting in the NIR. A water&#8208;stable EDOT&#8208;linked tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue efficiently photo&#8208;induce 1O2 production. Both bind to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under visible light irradiation, exhibit rapid, strong cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
Three novel tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers, and their neutral precursors, showed significant red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;containing analogues, with one of the EDOT&#8208;derivatives emitting in the NIR region. Only the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation was stable in aqueous solution, indicating that direct attachment of a thiophene or even 3&#8208;methylthiophene to the boron atom is insufficient to provide hydrolytic stability in aqueous solution. Further comparative analysis of the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue revealed efficient photo&#8208;induced singlet oxygen production, with the consequent biological implications. Thus, both analogues bind strongly to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, very efficiently enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under intense visible light irradiation, they exhibit almost instantaneous and very strong cytotoxic effects, presumably attributed to singlet oxygen production. Thus, both compounds are intriguing theranostic agents, whose intracellular and probably intra&#8208;tissue location can be monitored by strong fluorescence, allowing switching on of the strong bioactivity by well&#8208;focused visible light.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Proteins via a Bio&#8208;Inspired Copper(II)&#8208;Mediated Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Pydinecarboxaldehyde derivatives undergoes unique aldol reaction at the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins in the presence of a copper(II) salt under mild conditions. Peptides and proteins are readily modified with useful functional groups or reactive handles in a single step.







Abstract
The chemical modification of proteins is an effective technique for manipulating the properties and functions of proteins, and for creating protein&#8208;based materials. The N&#8208;terminus is a promising target for single&#8208;site modification that provides modified proteins with uniform structures and properties. In this paper, a copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction with 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PC) derivatives is proposed as an operationally simple method to selectively modify the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins at room temperature and physiological pH. The copper(II) ion activates the N&#8208;terminal amino acids by complexation with an imine of the N&#8208;terminal amino acid and 2&#8208;PCs, realizing the selective formation of the nucleophilic intermediate at the N&#8208;terminus. This results in a stable carbon&#8208;carbon bond between the 2&#8208;PCs and the &#945;&#8208;carbon of various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. The reaction is applied to four different proteins, including biopharmaceuticals such as filgrastim and trastuzumab. The modified trastuzumab retains the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 recognition activity.

         <title>A Route to Lipid ALC&#8208;0315: a Key Component of a COVID&#8208;19 mRNA Vaccine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ALC&#8208;0315 is a key component of the Pfizer&#8208;BioNTech COVID&#8208;19 vaccine and a highly sought&#8208;after lipid for nucleic acid therapeutics research. This paper, a study in reductive amination, describes a synthetic route that more than doubles the overall yield relative to the published one. Key aspects of the work include the use of (i) a protected form of a poorly organic&#8208;soluble aminoalcohol, (ii) a TEMPO/bleach oxidation to produce crucial aldehydes, and (iii) a more organic&#8208;soluble triacyloxyborohydride reagent.

         <title>The Importance of Mg2+&#8208;free State in Nucleotide Exchange of Oncogenic K&#8208;Ras Mutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For efficient targeting of oncogenic K&#8208;Ras interaction sites, a mechanistic picture of the Ras&#8208;cycle is necessary. Herein, we used NMR relaxation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the role of slow dynamics in wild&#8208;type and three oncogenic P&#8208;loop mutants of K&#8208;Ras. Our measurements reveal a dominant two&#8208;state conformational exchange on the ms timescale in both GDP&#8208; and GTP&#8208;bound K&#8208;Ras. The identified low&#8208;populated higher energy state in GDP&#8208;loaded K&#8208;Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide&#8208;bound/Mg  2+  &#8208;free state characterized by shortened &#946;2/&#946;3&#8208;strands and a partially released switch&#8208;I region preparing K&#8208;Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation&#8208;specific differences in K&#8208;Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our understanding of prolonged K&#8208;Ras signaling and may aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K&#8208;Ras.</dc:description>

         <title>Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission from an AB&#8208;Type Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent polymers are generally molecularly designed by polymerization of luminescent moieties, in which the polymerization method exbibits limited effect on luminescent properties. In addition, the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Here, a &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for the molecular design of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer via Barbier polymerization, resulting in a series of nonconjugated luminescent polymers through polymerization&#8208;induced emission.







Abstract
Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending the &#960; system of the polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into the polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi&#8208;step procedures. Meanwhile, according to the step&#8208;growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from an AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) from an AB&#8208;type monomer. The key step in the realization of the hyperbranched polymer is bi&#8208;functionalization of a mono&#8208;functional group. Through a Barbier reaction between an organohalide and an ester group in one pot, bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional ester is realized through two&#8208;step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through&#8208;space conjugation and inter&#8208; and intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effects induced by polymer chain, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation&#8208;induced emission type PIEgen.

     alt="Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization-Induced Emission from an AB-Type Monomer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luminescent polymers&lt;/b&gt; are generally molecularly designed by polymerization of luminescent moieties, in which the polymerization method exbibits limited effect on luminescent properties. In addition, the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB-type monomer is still challenging. Here, a &#8220;bi-functionalization of mono-functional group&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for the molecular design of hyperbranched polymers from AB-type monomer via Barbier polymerization, resulting in a series of nonconjugated luminescent polymers through polymerization-induced emission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending the &#960; system of the polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into the polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi-step procedures. Meanwhile, according to the step-growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from an AB-type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one-pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization-induced emission (PIE) from an AB-type monomer. The key step in the realization of the hyperbranched polymer is bi-functionalization of a mono-functional group. Through a Barbier reaction between an organohalide and an ester group in one pot, bi-functionalization of mono-functional ester is realized through two-step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through-space conjugation and inter- and intramolecular charge-transfer effects induced by polymer chain, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation-induced emission type PIEgen. Whereas, it is aggregation-caused quenching type PIEgen if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen are in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting systems. This work, therefore, expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymers through &#8220;bi-functionalization of mono-functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one-pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. We now report a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba&#8208;dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the anion&#8211;radical state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at &#955;max&#8764;1300&#8197;nm and can be either oxidized to a regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M = Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Thomas, J. van&#8197;Lierop, V.&#8197;N. Nemykin, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201181).

         <title>A Formylglycine&#8208;Peptide for the Site&#8208;Directed Identification of Phosphotyrosine&#8208;Mimetic Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of protein&#8208;binding fragments for precisely defined binding sites is an unmet challenge so far. Here, we investigate formylglycine as a molecular probe for the sensitive detection of fragments binding to a spatially defined protein site. Formylglycine peptide&#160;  3&#160;  was derived from a phosphotyrosine&#8208;containing peptide substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by replacing the phosphorylated amino acid with the reactive electrophile. Fragment ligation with formylglycine occurred in&#8208;situ in aqueous physiological buffer. Structures and kinetics were validated by NMR spectroscopy. Screening and hit validation revealed fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated hit fragments being able to replace the native phosphotyrosine residue. The formylglycine probe identified low&#8208;affinity fragments with high spatial resolution as substantiated by molecular modelling. The best fragment hit, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl&#8208;acetic acid, was converted into a cellularly active, nanomolar inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized pseudo&#8208;  meta  [2.2]para&#173;cyclo&#173;phanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure literature known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, we show that the pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches an astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, we show that the chiral pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs induce remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307 L mol  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by the ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times enhancement of the hydrogen production rate than the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Dissecting non&#8208;covalent interactions in carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids exhibiting double and single hydrogens bonds between ions of like charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid 1&#8722;(carboxymethyl)pyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [HOOC&#8722;CH  2  &#8722;py][NTf  2  ] exhibits three types of hydrogen bonding: The expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and surprisingly single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows analyzing and characterizing all types of hydrogen bonding present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid. We find doubly hydrogen bonded cationic dimers (c  +  =c  +  ) in the crystalline phase. With increasing temperature, this binding motif opens in the liquid and is replaced by (c  +  &#8722;c  +  &#8722;a  &#8722;  ) species, with a remaining single cationic hydrogen bond and an additional hydrogen bond between cation and anion. We provide clear evidence that the IL evaporates as hydrogen bonded ion pairs (c  +  &#8722;a  &#8722;  ) into the gas phase. The measured transition enthalpies allow to dissect the non&#8208;covalent interactions and to determine the hydrogen bond strength between ions of like charge.</dc:description>

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the fact that hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx  nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composite has a high HER performance with 114 &#956;mol/h/gcat  , which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx  and Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Conversion of an Unstable Imine Cage to a Stable Cage with Amide Moieties towards Selective Receptor for Fluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of robust covalent macrocycles/cages via multiple amide&#8208;bond forming reaction is highly challenging and generally it needs multistep reactions. One&#8208;pot reaction of appropriate di&#8208;/tri&#8208;acyl chloride with a diamine generally results polymers or oligomers instead of discrete architectures. To overcome this limitation, a strategy is reported here using dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction of imine&#8208;based macrocycle and cage upon treatment of a diamine with di&#8208; and tri&#8208;aldehydes respectively, followed by post&#8208;synthesis one&#8208;step conversion of imine bonds to amides to form the desired robust macrocycle and cage containing multiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found to form aggregates in DMSO, the cage was intact without any aggregation. Six amide groups in the confined pocket of the cage made it an ideal receptor for selective binding of fluoride with very high selectivity (~3 103 fold) over chloride, and it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and other oxyanions.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photoinduced Conversion of Unprecedented Norbornadiene&#8208;Based Photoswitches with Redox&#8208;Active Naphthalene Diimide Functionalities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented compound class of functional organic hybrids consisting of a photoswitchable norbornadiene building block and a redoxactive chromophore, namely naphthalene diimide, were designed and synthesized. Within these structures the capability of rylene chromophores to function as a redox active catalyst upon their photoexcitation was utilized to initiate the oxidative back&#8208;conversion of the  in&#8208;situ  formed quadricyclane unit to its norbornadiene analogue. In this way successive photoexcitation at two differenr wavelengths enabled a controlled photoswitching between the two isomerical states of the hybrids. Beyond this prove of concept, the dependency of the reaction rate to the intramolecular distance of the two functional molecular building blocks as well as the concentration of the photoexcited sample was monitored. The experimental findings and interpretations were furthermore supported by quantum chemical investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Alkali Metal Manganate Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Solvent&#8208;Induced Dissociation Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare examples of heavier alkali metal manganates [{(AM)Mn(CH  2  SiMe  3  )(N  `Ar  )  2  }  &#8734;  ] (AM = K, Rb, or Cs) [N  `Ar  = N(SiMe  3  )(Dipp)] have been synthesised with the Rb and Cs examples crystallographically characterised. These heaviest manganates crystallise as polymeric zig&#8208;zag chains propagated by AM&#8943;&#960;&#8208;arene interactions. Key to their preparation is to avoid Lewis base donor solvents. In contrast, using multidentate nitrogen donors encourages ligand scrambling leading to redistribution of these bimetallic manganate compounds into their corresponding homometallic species as witnessed for the complete Li &#8211; Cs series. Adding to the few known crystallographically characterised unsolvated and solvated rubidium and caesium s&#8208;block metal amides, six new derivatives ([{AM(N  `Ar  )}  &#8734;  ], [{AM(N  `Ar  )&#183;TMEDA}  &#8734;  ], and [{AM(N  `Ar  )&#183;PMDETA}  &#8734;  ] where AM = Rb or Cs) have been structurally authenticated. Utilising monodentate diethyl ether as a donor, it was also possible to isolate and crystallographically characterise sodium manganate [(Et  2  O)  2  Na(  n  Bu)Mn[(N  `Ar  )  2  ], a monomeric, dinuclear structure prevented from aggregating by two blocking ether ligands bound to sodium.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum(VI) Bis(imido) Complexes: From Frustrated Lewis Pairs to Weakly Coordinating Cations</title>

         <dc:description>Molybdenum(VI) bis(imido) complexes [Mo(N t Bu) 2 (L R ) 2 ] (R=H 1a ; R=CF 3 1b ) combined with B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ( 1a /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 , 1b /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ) exhibit a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) character that can heterolytically split H&#8208;H, Si&#8208;H and O&#8208;H bonds. Cleavage of H 2 and Et 3 SiH affords ion pairs [Mo(N t Bu)(NH t Bu)(L R ) 2 ][HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ] (R=H 2a ; R=CF 3 2b ) composed of a Mo(VI) amido imido cation and a hydridoborate anion, while reaction with H 2 O leads to [Mo(N t Bu)(NH t Bu)(L R ) 2 ][(HO)B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ] (R=H 3a ; R=CF 3 3b ). Ion pairs 2a and 2b are hydrosilylation catalysts for aldehydes with triethylsilane, with 2b being more active than 2a . Mechanistic elucidation revealed insertion of the aldehyde into the B&#8208;H bond of [HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]&#175;. We were able to isolate and fully characterize, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the inserted products Mo(N t Bu)(NH t Bu)(L R ) 2 ][{PhCH 2 O}B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ] (R=H 4a ; R=CF 3 4b ). Catalysis occurs at [HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]&#175; while [Mo(N t Bu)(NH t Bu)(L R ) 2 ] + (R=H or CF 3 ) act as the cationic counterions. However, the striking difference in reactivity gives ample evidence that molybdenum cations behave as weakly coordinating cations (WCC).</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Allenyne&#8211;Alkyne [4 + 2] Cycloaddition and Its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new [4 + 2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8211;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Modulation of Antibiotic Resistance by Photoswitchable Cystobactamids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rise of antibiotic resistance causes a serious health care problem, and its counterfeit demands novel, innovative concepts. The combination of photopharmacology, enabling a light&#8208;controlled reversible modulation of drug activity, with antibiotic drug design has led to first photoswitchable antibiotic compounds derived from established scaffolds. In this study, we converted cystobactamids, gyrase&#8208;inhibiting natural products with an oligoaryl scaffold and highly potent antibacterial activities, into photoswitchable agents by inserting azobenzene in the  N  &#8208;terminal part and/or an acylhydrazone moiety near the  C&#8208;  terminus, yielding twenty analogs that contain mono&#8208; as well as double&#8208;switches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties could be modulated 3.4&#8208;fold and 5&#8208;fold by light, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of photoswitchable cystobactamids towards two known resistance factors, the peptidase AlbD and the scavenger protein AlbA, was light&#8208;dependent. While irradiation of an analog with an  N  &#8208;terminal azobenzene with 365 nm light led to less degradation by AlbD, the AlbA&#8208;mediated inactivation was induced. This provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that resistance towards photoswitchable antibiotics can be optically controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Water&#8208;Soluble Esterase&#8208;Activated CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules Targeting Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide (CO) as a cell&#8208;protective and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent, CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) offer promising potential applications in medicine. We synthesized a set of acyloxy&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes, all displaying a N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pyridinium triflate moiety in the ester side chain, as mitochondria&#8208;targeting esterase&#8208;triggered CORM prodrugs. While the compounds in which the acyloxy substituent is attached to the 2&#8208;position of the diene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 unit (A series) spontaneously release CO upon dissolution in phosphate buffer,&#160;which is partly suppressed in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE), the 1&#8208;substituted isomers (B series) show the expected PLE&#8208;induced release of CO (up to 3 equiv.). The biological activity of  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2  /  3&#8208;B  and their isophorone&#8208;derived analogs  2/3&#8208;A&#8217;  &#160;was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). While  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B  were not cytotoxic up to 500 &#181;M (MTT assay),  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;  caused significant toxicity at concentrations above 50 &#181;M. The anti&#8208;inflammatory potential of both Mito&#8208;CORM variants was demonstrated by concentration&#8208;dependent down&#8208;regulation of the pro&#8208;inflammatory markers&#160;as well as induction of HO&#8208;1 in TNF&#945; stimulated HUVEC. Energy phenotyping by Seahorse Real&#8208;Time Cell Metabolic Analysis, revealed opposing shifts&#160;of metabolic potentials (mitochondrial respiration/glycolytic activity)&#160;in cells treated either with  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B  &#160;or  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;. Thus, the Mito&#8208;CORMs represent valuable tools for the safe and targeted delivery of CO to mitochondria as a subcellular compartment to induce anti&#8208;inflammatory effects with only minor shifts in cellular energy metabolism. Also, due to their water solubility, these compounds provide&#160;promising options for further pharmacological studies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide (CO) as a cell-protective and anti-inflammatory agent, CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) offer promising potential applications in medicine. We synthesized a set of acyloxy-cyclohexadiene-Fe(CO)3 complexes, all displaying a N-methyl-pyridinium triflate moiety in the ester side chain, as mitochondria-targeting esterase-triggered CORM prodrugs. While the compounds in which the acyloxy substituent is attached to the 2-position of the diene-Fe(CO)3 unit (A series) spontaneously release CO upon dissolution in phosphate buffer,&#160;which is partly suppressed in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE), the 1-substituted isomers (B series) show the expected PLE-induced release of CO (up to 3 equiv.). The biological activity of  Mito-CORMs 2  /  3-B  and their isophorone-derived analogs  2/3-A&#8217;  &#160;was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). While  Mito-CORMs 2/3-B  were not cytotoxic up to 500 &#181;M (MTT assay),  Mito-CORMs 2/3-A&#8217;  caused significant toxicity at concentrations above 50 &#181;M. The anti-inflammatory potential of both Mito-CORM variants was demonstrated by concentration-dependent down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory markers&#160;as well as induction of HO-1 in TNF&#945; stimulated HUVEC. Energy phenotyping by Seahorse Real-Time Cell Metabolic Analysis, revealed opposing shifts&#160;of metabolic potentials (mitochondrial respiration/glycolytic activity)&#160;in cells treated either with  Mito-CORMs 2/3-B  &#160;or  Mito-CORMs 2/3-A&#8217;. Thus, the Mito-CORMs represent valuable tools for the safe and targeted delivery of CO to mitochondria as a subcellular compartment to induce anti-inflammatory effects with only minor shifts in cellular energy metabolism.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of A Stable Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite with 15&#215;12&#215;12 Member&#8208;Ring Channels</title>

         <dc:description>
Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;13 is synthesized by using an easily obtained 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents, which possesses a rare 15&#215;12&#215;12&#8208;ring pore system. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain stable high silica and acidic aluminosilicate zeolites.







Abstract
Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents. NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.

         <title>H2, B&#8722;H, and Si&#8722;H Bond Activation and Facile Protonolysis Driven by Pt&#8208;Base Metal Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca dimethyl complexes feature various degrees of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;Me interactions and show Pt/Zn cooperative activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds, observed only when Zn is in close proximity to Pt, as well as facile protonolysis by water, MeOH and C&#8722;H bond of terminal acetylene.







Abstract
We report a series of heterobimetallic Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca complexes to study the effect of proximity of a dicationic base metal on the organometallic Pt species. Varying degrees of Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn and Zn interaction with the bridging Me group are achieved, showcasing snapshots of a hypothetical process of retrotransmetalation from Pt to Zn. In contrast, only weak interactions were observed for Ca with a Pt&#8208;bound Me group. Activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds leads to the formation of hydride&#8208;bridged Pt&#8722;H&#8722;Zn complexes, which is not observed in the absence of Zn, pointing out the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperation. Reactivity of PtMe2/M2+ with terminal acetylene, water and methanol is also studied, leading to facile protonation of one of the Me groups at the Pt center only when Zn is present. This study sheds light on various ways in which the presence of a 2+ metal cation significantly affects the reactivity of a common organoplatinum complex.

         <title>Enhancement of Mass and Charge Transfer during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without a Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass transfer of CO2 in aqueous solutions has been enhanced by surface hydrophobic modification. The in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy without any organic barrier layer facilitates charge transfer from catalysts to the reactant. With less obstruction to charge transfer, higher CO2 and lower H+ surface concentrations, the rate of generation of methanol from the CRR is elevated to up to 247.15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) represents a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. But mass&#8208;transfer limitations seriously hinder the forward step. Enhancing the surface hydrophobicity by using polymers has been proved to be one of the most efficient strategies. However, as macromolecular organics, polymers on the surface hinder the transfer of charge carriers from catalysts to reactants. Herein, we describe an in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy to enhance the surface hydrophobicity of TiO2 without a barrier layer of organics, thus facilitating the mass transfer of CO2 to catalysts and charge transfer. With less obstruction to charge transfer, a higher CO2, and lower H+ surface concentration, the photocatalytic CRR generation rate of methanol (CH3OH) is greatly enhanced to up to 247.15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, we investigated the overall defects; enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of catalysts provides a general and reliable method to improve the competitiveness of CRR.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record resonance: An anionic seven&#8208;vertex siliconoid cluster with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and a record upfield 29Si NMR chemical shift at &#8722;413.9&#8197;ppm is described. It was analyzed by magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations.







Abstract
The silanide [Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (1) transforms into the anionic siliconoid cluster [Si7{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (2) with four unsubstituted silicon atoms as a contact ion pair with [K([18]crown&#8208;6)] in C6D6 at room temperature within five weeks. Anion 2 was investigated by natural population analysis and visualization of intrinsic atomic orbitals. Magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations of 2 revealed two distinct strong diatropic vortices that sum up in one direction and create a strongly shielded apical silicon atom in 2.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Bimetallic Platinum (II)&#8208;Ferrocene Antitumor Agent Induces Non&#8208;Apoptotic Cell Death and Exerts in Vivo Efficacy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrid 2 circumvents apoptosis and multifactorial cisplatin resistance, exhibits multi&#8208;pronged action in cancer cells &#8208; promoting necroptosis and paraptosis, and exerts in&#8197;vivo anticancer efficacy in mice xenograft model.







Abstract
Despite phenomenal clinical success, the efficacy of platinum anticancer drugs is often compromised due to inherent and acquired drug resistant phenotypes in cancers. To circumvent this issue, we designed two heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrids that display multi&#8208;pronged anticancer action. In cancer cells, our best compound, 2, platinates DNA, produces reactive oxygen species, and has nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum as potential targets. The multi&#8208;modal mechanism of action of these hybrid agents lead to non&#8208;apoptotic cell death induction which enables circumventing apoptosis resistance and significant improvement in platinum cross resistance profile. Finally, in addition to describing detail mechanistic insights, we also assessed its stability in plasma and demonstrate anticancer efficacy in an in&#8197;vivo A2780 xenograft model. Strikingly, compared to oxaliplatin, our compound displays better tolerability, safety profile and efficacy in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Induced Circular Polarized Luminescence in One&#8208;Dimensional Manganese(II) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive 1D manganese(II) halide hybrid is successfully prepared by self&#8208;assembly of accessible amine acid salt and low&#8208;cost manganese chloride. The known d&#8211;d transition of Mn2+ in octahedral coordination results in strong red emission with PLQY as high as 67.1&#8197;%. The as&#8208;formed 1D manganese(II) hybrids exhibit excellent CD signals in ground state and distinguished CPL activity with dissymmetry factor g as high as 6.3*10&#8722;3 in excited state due to the existence of chiral amine acid salt.







Abstract
Circular polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials attract great attentions owing to their widely applications in 3D optical displays and encrypted transmission. Inspired by the strategies adopted in perovskite based CPL materials, herein, CPL&#8208;active hybrids (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3 were successfully prepared by assembling chiral D/L tert&#8208;butyl prolinate with manganese (II) chloride. Single crystal structures show the as&#8208;formed hybrids possess one&#8208;dimensional (1D) structure containing linear chains of face&#8208;sharing MnCl6 octahedral surrounded by prolinate cations. The 1D Mn(II) hybrids display strong red emission peaked at 646&#8197;nm with PLQY of 67.1&#8197;% and 57.2&#8197;% for d&#8208;type and l&#8208;type, respectively, representing the highest PLQY for 1D MnII hybrids. Interestingly, the 1D Mn(II) hybrids exhibit prominent circular dichroism (CD) signals and remarkable CPL activity with the dissymmetry factor g of 6.1*10&#8722;3 and &#8722;6.3*10&#8722;3 from 550 to 800&#8197;nm for (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3, respectively, owing to the existence of chiral cations. It is worthy noted the obtained g represents the highest value for non&#8208;lead organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids.

         <title>Ag Doped Au44 Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6) cluster has been synthesized and the Ag doping positions can be precisely determined. The electrochemical reduction process of CO2 to CO can be promoted by Ag doping into Au cluster, due to the modulated electronic properties and structural reconstruction by Ag doping. The work provides an opportunity for understanding the heteroatom&#8208;doping role in modulating the catalytic properties of metal clusters.







Abstract
A novel Ag doped Au44(C10H9)28 nanocluster (C10H10=1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzene) was synthesized, that is, Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6), where four Ag positions located in the surface staple of the cluster have been determined, while six Au/Ag co&#8208;occupying positions have been found in the metal core of the cluster. The electronic configuration of Au44(C10H9)28 cluster is significantly disturbed by doping Ag atoms, hence promoting the electron transport capability. For the two&#8208;electron conversion reaction of CO2 to CO in electrochemical reduction of CO2, Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 catalyst exhibited higher effective activity and long&#8208;term stability than its counterpart Au44(C10H9)28 catalyst.

         <title>From Nanoparticle Ensembles to Single Nanoparticles: Techniques for the Investigation of Plasmon Enhanced Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC), where specific electrochemical reactions are promoted due to the reduced energy barrier of the reaction processes by the light excited &#8220;hot carriers&#8221; of the plasmonic nanoparticles, has aroused tremendous interest in recent years. A deep understanding of the PEEC process becomes a key issue for facilitating PEEC catalyst design and improving PEEC performance. This concept article begins with a brief discussion of the macroscopic electrochemical method of PEEC study of the plasmonic nanoparticle ensembles. Following that, we highlight two electrochemical techniques that may possess single nanoparticle sensitivity,  i.e.  , scanning electrochemical microscope and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. The pros and cons of each technique are discussed and an outlook is given. We hope to provide the readers with the current status of PEEC to evoke reflections regarding the reaction mechanisms, performance improvement, and the utilizations to important systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Loading and High&#8208;Performing Ionic Liquid&#8208;Immobilizing Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst (MTOA)5[SiW11O39Rh] (MOTA=methyltrioctylammonium cation), which can afford exceptionally high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes at an ultralow loading of Rh (ca. 3 ppm). For styrene hydroformylation, both the conversion and the yield of the aldehyde can reach almost 99%, and the TOF was obtained as high as 9000 h&#8208;1 without usage of any phosphine ligand in the reaction process. The further characterization by FT&#8208;IR, ICP and ESI&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the Rh single atom was incorporated in the lacunary POM anions. Especially, the bulky IL cation can provide an additional role in stabilizing Rh species and thus prevented from aggregation and leaching of Rh species. The IL catalyst was miscible with n&#8208;hexane under the elevated temperature conditions, which contributed to exceptionally high activity for hydroformylation even at ultra&#8208;low loading of IL catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxygenated Sesquiterpenoids Enabled by Combining Metabolic Engineering and Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;Chem collaboration: Escherichia coli fermentation and visible&#8208;light photocatalysis were combined in a complementary way for the first time, to realize the scaffold assembly in a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; fashion and the subsequent diversifications in a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; manner, respectively, enabling the production of six sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, genetically engineered Escherichia coli fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene was combined with metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone, cis&#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8722;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. It was shown that the anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereo&#8208;electronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.

         <title>Alkylation of Nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution &#8211; Experimental and DFT Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS) was tested experimentally and modelled with DFT calculations. Mechanistic studies reveal intrinsic differences between reactions of archetypal carbanion precursor PhSO2CH2Cl, and alkyl phenyl sulfones, in which benzenesulfinate acts as a leaving group. Accordingly, for the latter precursors steric hindrance develops at the &#946;&#8208;elimination step, that raises energy barrier and results in the formation of byproducts.

Abstract
Cu&#8208;Catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multiheterocyclic structures from &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides is reported. This domino reaction strategy enables the construction of multiheterocycles in one step. Mechanistic studies showed that two catalytically generated iminiums are likely to be key intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used in a chemoselective manner to produce multicyclic products in the reaction with ketones possessing two different carbonyls.

         <title>Study of Carbamoyl Fluoride: Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F plan: Carbamoyl fluorides can be synthesized easily and safely under metal&#8208;free and inexpensive conditions. These compounds are stable under a wide range of conditions, especially close to physiologic ones. In addition, they can be radiolabeled by 18F/19F isotopic exchange.







Abstract
Carbamoyl fluoride is a fluorinated group that, to this date, remains underexplored, probably due to the lack of data concerning its properties. In this paper, a study of carbamoyl fluoride is presented. Stability studies, in particular under physiological conditions, and lipophilicity measurement were performed. A new easy, safe, inexpensive, and metal&#8208;free synthesis method is also described. Finally, a potential use in radiochemistry through a 18F/19F isotopic exchange is demonstrated.

PGeP pincers: A family of germyl rhodium(I) PGeP pincer complexes has been prepared from a metal&#8208;free germylene based on a dipyrromethane scaffold functionalized with two phosphane sidearms. These complexes have shown a rich derivative chemistry both at the germanium (chloride substitutions) and rhodium atoms (ligand substitutions, oxidative additions), providing tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexacoordinate rhodium complexes, some of which are also active catalyst precursors (olefin hydroboration).







Abstract
A family of germyl rhodium complexes derived from the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 (1), has been prepared. Germylene 1 reacted readily with [RhCl(PPh3)3] and [RhCl(cod)(PPh3)] (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) to give, in both cases, the PGeP&#8208;pincer chloridogermyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (2). Similarly, the reaction of 1 with [RhCl(cod)(MeCN)] afforded [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(MeCN)] (3). The methoxidogermyl and methylgermyl rhodium(I) complexes [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (R=OMe, 4; Me, 5) were prepared by treating complex 2 with LiOMe and LiMe, respectively. Complex 5 readily reacted with CO to give the carbonyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(CO)] (6), with HCl, HSnPh3 and Ph2S2 rendering the pentacoordinate methylgermyl rhodium(III) complexes [RhHX{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (X=Cl, 7; SnPh3, 8) and [Rh(SPh)2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (9), respectively, and with H2 to give the hexacoordinate derivative [RhH2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (10). Complexes 3 and 5 are catalyst precursors for the hydroboration of styrene, 4&#8208;vinyltoluene and 4&#8208;vinylfluorobenzene with catecholborane under mild conditions.

         <title>Effect of Annulation Mode of Twistarene on the Physical Property and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior of Functionalized Curved Aromatic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is of great significance. Herein this work describes the design and modular preparation of four novel arenes where their structures are determined via X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors and switchable photoconductivity of such curved molecules were investigated in detail.







Abstract
Four novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3&#8201;a, 5, 8, 15&#8201;a have been synthesized and characterized, where molecules 3&#8201;a and 15&#8201;a bear [5]carbohelicene units. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses indicate that compound 3&#8201;a shows offset packing arrangements of (P5)&#8208; and (M5)&#8208;isomers, and 15&#8201;a has a symmetrical plane and looks like a butterfly. In comparison, 8 exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42&#8197;&#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as&#8208;prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.

         <title>Lanthanide SMMs Based on Belt Macrocycles: Recent Advances and General Trends</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A belt to control anisotropy. This review presents the development of mononuclear lanthanide SMMs based on belt macrocycles. Literature systems are classified in crown ethers, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown complexes. Molecule families are compared in terms of their coordination number and geometry, focusing on the degree of structural distortion associated with different belt macrocycles. General trends with respect to demagnetization barriers and effective suppression of transverse magnetic anisotropy components are also discussed.







Abstract
Enhancement of axial magnetic anisotropy is the central objective to push forward the performance of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) complexes. In the case of mononuclear lanthanide complexes, the chemical environment around the paramagnetic ion must be tuned to place strongly interacting ligands along either the axial positions or the equatorial plane, depending on the oblate or prolate preference of the selected lanthanide. One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial&#8208;equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) Through Synthetic Optimisation and Postsynthetic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexibility of the MOF MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) is described and compared to its well&#8208;established Fe analogue. Its breathing behaviour can be controlled through installation of formate bridges during synthesis that ensure rigidity by structural buttressing, or by postsynthetic bromination of the fumarate linker to induce rigidity by the steric influence of the bulky linker substituents.







Abstract
Breathing behaviour in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties. In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre&#8208;synthetically using functionalised linkers. Herein, it was shown that MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by 1) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate&#8208;buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous; and 2) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non&#8208;porous. In addition to providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, it was shown that bromination of the formate&#8208;bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.

     alt="Controlling the Flexibility of MIL-88A(Sc) Through Synthetic Optimisation and Postsynthetic Halogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The flexibility of the MOF&lt;/b&gt; MIL-88A(Sc) is described and compared to its well-established Fe analogue. Its breathing behaviour can be controlled through installation of formate bridges during synthesis that ensure rigidity by structural buttressing, or by postsynthetic bromination of the fumarate linker to induce rigidity by the steric influence of the bulky linker substituents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathing behaviour in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties. In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre-synthetically using functionalised linkers. Herein, it was shown that MIL-88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by 1) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate-buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous; and 2) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non-porous. In addition to providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, it was shown that bromination of the formate-bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Platform for Novel Reaction Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of new chemical bond formation in high&#8208;throughput synthesis is limited by the efficiency and scalability of reaction product detection, as conventional methods for product isolation from reaction mixtures are time consuming and labor intensive. Here, we report a miniaturizable purification method that enables rapid, high&#8208;throughput isolation of quaternary ammonium&#8208;tagged products from reaction mixtures with excellent purity using inexpensive equipment that can be easily set up in a typical organic chemistry laboratory. This novel purification technique enabled us to establish a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. We validated this platform in a screen of 1536 reactions, which identified one&#160;previously unreported transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Adipic Esters and Adiponitrile via Photoassisted Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon 6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized butane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Insight into Photo&#8208;induced Damages of Unnatural Base Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) are important to maintain the genetic code integrity, and critical for developing healthy semisynthetic organisms. As reported, dTPT3 was less stable upon irradiation, and thus might act as a pervasive photosensitizer to induce oxidative damages within DNA, causing harm to living semi&#8208;synthetic organisms when exposed to UVA radiation. However, there was no knowledge about molecular&#8208;level understanding of this damage process. In this paper, we not only identified four photoproducts of dTPT3, including desulfur&#8208;dTPT3 (dTPT3  H  ), TPT3 sulphinate (TPT3  SO2  ), TPT3 sulphonate (TPT3  SO3  ) and TPT3&#8208;thioTPT3 (TPT3  S  TPT3), but also established a Type II photosensitized oxidation mechanism. In addition, the antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) was able to effectively inhibit the photoproducts formation of dTPT3 and dTPT3 in DNA, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA bearing dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects. The comprehensive understanding of TPT3&#8217; photochemical stability will give researchers helpful guidance to design more photo&#8208;stable UBPs and construct healthier semisynthetic organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Sorption Controls Extreme Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single Crystal Molecular Reorganization in Hydrogen Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because hydrogen bonded frameworks are held together by relatively weak interactions, they often form several different frameworks under slightly different synthesis conditions, and respond dynamically to stimuli such as heat and vacuum. However, these dynamic restructuring processes are often poorly understood. In this work, three isoreticular hydrogen bonded organic frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted amidinium&#183;&#183;&#183;carboxylate hydrogen bonds (1C/C, 1Si/C and 1Si/Si) are studied. Three distinct phases for 1C/C and four for 1Si/C and 1Si/Si are fully structurally characterized. The transitions between these phases involve extreme yet recoverable molecular&#8208;level framework reorganization. It is demonstrate that these transformations are related to water content and can be controlled by humidity, and that the non&#8208;porous anhydrous phase of 1C/C shows reversible water sorption through single crystal to crystal restructuring. This mechanistic insight opens the way for the future use of the inherent dynamism present in hydrogen bonded frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformations of Strained Three&#8208;Membered Rings as Common, Yet Overlooked Motif in Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum mechanical tunneling has long been recognized as an important phenomenon when considering transformations dominated by a lightweight hydrogen atom. Tunneling of heavier atoms like carbon, initially dismissed as negligible, has seen a quickly increasing number of computationally predicted and/or experimentally confirmed examples over the last decade, highlighting its importance for a wide variety of reactions. However, no common structural motif has been pointed out within these seemingly unconnected examples, strongly limiting the predictability of the impact of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling on a given reaction. This Concept Article will provide this perspective and showcase how the recognition of the formation and cleavage of three&#8208;membered rings as common motif can inform the prediction and research into heavy&#8208;atom tunneling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 separation by imide/imine organic cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel imide/imine&#8208;based organic cages were prepared and studied as materials for the selective separation of CO  2  from N  2  and CH  4  in Vacuum Swing Adsorption conditions. Gas adsorption on the new compounds showed selectivity for CO  2  over N  2  and CH  4  . The cages were also tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation. Dense and robust membranes were obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid  &#174;  or PEEK&#8208;WC polymers. Improved gas transport properties and selectivity for CO  2  were achieved compared to the neat polymer membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coordination Network Featuring Two Distinct Copper(II) Coordination Environments for Highly Selective Acetylene Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#183;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8209;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single&#8208;crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#160;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Activation of Small Molecules by a Stable Chiral Silene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the dilithium salt of the enantiopure (  S  )&#8208;BINOL (1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol) with two equivalents of the amidinate&#8208;stabilized chlorosilylene L  Ph  SiCl (L  Ph  = PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ) led to the formation of the first example of a chiral cyclic silene species comprising a (  S  )&#8208;BINOL ligand. The reactivity of the Si=C bond was investigated by reaction with elemental sulfur, CO  2  and HCl. Reaction with S  8  led to a Si=C bond cleavage and concomitant to a ring&#8208;opened product with imine and silanethione functional groups. Reaction with CO  2  resulted in cleaving of the CO  2  molecule into a carbonyl group and an isolated O atom, while one new stereocenter is formed in a highly selective manner. According to DFT calculations, the [2+2] cycloaddition product is the key intermediate. Further reactivity studies of the chiral cyclic silene with HCl resulted in a stereoselective addition to the Si=C bond, while the fully selective formation of two stereocenters was achieved. The quantitative stereoselective addition of CO  2  and HCl to a Si=C bond is unprecedented.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic signature of dynamical instability of the aqueous complex in the brown&#8208;ring nitrate test</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of the brown&#8208;ring test has been investigated for nearly a century. Though recent studies have focused on solid state structure determination and the measurement of spectra, mechanistic details and kinetics, the aspects of solution structure and dynamics remain unknown. We have investigated structural fluctuations of the brown&#8208;ring complex in aqueous solution with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, from which we identified that the classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+  complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal&#160;[Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+  complex. Based on the inability in multi&#8208;reference calculations to reproduce the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectra in aqueous solution by inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+  complex alone, we propose the existence of an equilibrium between pseudo&#8208;octahedral and square&#8208;pyramidal complexes. Despite challenges in constructing models reproducing the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum, the advanced spectrum simulation tool motivates us to challenge the established picture of a sole pseudo&#8208;octahedral complex in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Mannosylerythritol Lipid Analogues and their Self&#8208;Assembling Properties, Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells, and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Aza&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides as Reactive Intermediates: Generation and Utility in Contemporary Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has been showing budding progress in the past years. Herein, the asymmetric catalysis involving these transient intermediates is highlighted, which was made possible by well&#8208;designed catalysts as well as new aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM precursors/substrates.







Abstract
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has overwhelmingly progressed in the past few decades. This review aims to integrate various transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalytic strategies in taming aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM intermediates, including the aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;vinylidene quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;VQM), aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynyl quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;AQM), aza&#8208;para&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;p&#8208;QM), and indole&#8208;based aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM analog. These transient species are often utilized for the direct and enantioselective synthesis of complex (hetero)polycyclic or fused&#8208;ring molecular scaffolds such as tetrahydroquinoline and indoline, among others, which are abundant in many natural products, bioactive compounds, and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Installing Reduction Responsiveness into Biomolecules by Introducing Nitroaryl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RSVP: This Concept summarizes the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, constructed by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, with a focus on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.







Abstract
Artificially synthesized stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecules are attractive as molecular tools for monitoring and modulating biological systems. In biological systems, redox stimuli are common, and their dysregulation is typically linked to various abnormal or disease states. In this Concept article, the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, which are produced by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, is reviewed with a special emphasis on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.

     alt="Installing Reduction Responsiveness into Biomolecules by Introducing Nitroaryl Groups"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP&lt;/b&gt;: This Concept summarizes the molecular design of reduction-responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, constructed by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, with a focus on simple 4-nitrobenzene-based motifs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificially synthesized stimuli-responsive biomolecules are attractive as molecular tools for monitoring and modulating biological systems. In biological systems, redox stimuli are common, and their dysregulation is typically linked to various abnormal or disease states. In this Concept article, the molecular design of reduction-responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, which are produced by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, is reviewed with a special emphasis on simple 4-nitrobenzene-based motifs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Persulfurated Benzene&#8208;Cored Asterisks with &#960;&#8208;Extended ThioNaphthyl Arms: Synthesis, Structural, Photophysical and Covalent Dynamic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioisomeric asterisks (5&#8208;6) with naphthylthio arms are reported. Consequences on &#960;&#8208;extension around a persulfurated benzene bring different structural, photophysical and chemical properties. Sulfur exchanges reactions convert non emissive (5&#8211;6) into the best one (4). &#960;&#8208;Extension inhibits luminescence of a hexakis(phenylthio)benzene unit. Sc&#8208;XRD shows structural distortions and different behaviors of (5&#8211;6).







Abstract
The synthesis of regioisomeric asterisks (5) and (6) incorporating a benzene core with six 1&#8208;naphthylthio or six 2&#8208;naphthylthio arms are reported in search for new materials with optoelectronic properties. The consequences on the extension of a &#960; system surrounding a persulfurated benzene core provide a new avenue to study the structural, photophysical, and chemical properties of such family of all&#8208;organic phosphors. It also diverts the persulfuration mechanism after two radical cyclizations for making a [5]dithiohelicene by&#8208;product (7) and favors dynamic sulfur component exchange reactions surrounding the core. These exchanges convert asterisks (5) and (6), non&#8208;phosphorescent at 20&#8201;&#176;C to the highly phosphorescent (4) (&#981; &#8764;100&#8201;%, solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C). For asterisks (5) and (6), the absence of the typical phosphorescence of the per(phenylthio)benzene core in the solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C and the presence of a weak naphthalene&#8208;based phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K is attributed to an energy transfer from the triplet state of the persulfurated benzene core to the outer naphthalene moieties, resulting in an antenna system.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activated Liposomal Cell Delivery using a Boronate&#8208;Caged Guanidine Lipid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid for enhancing liposome cellular delivery mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reported. Our results showcase that this lipid enables cell delivery only after being activated in the presence of ROS. This approach exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.







Abstract
We report boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid 1 that activates liposomes for cellular delivery only upon uncaging of this compound by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce cationic lipid products. These liposomes are designed to mimic the exceptional cell delivery properties of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), while the inclusion of the boronate cage is designed to enhance selectivity such that cell entry will only be activated in the presence of ROS. Boronate uncaging by hydrogen peroxide was verified by mass spectrometry and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. A microplate&#8208;based fluorescence assay was developed to study the ROS&#8208;mediated vesicle interactions between 1&#8208;liposomes and anionic membranes, which were further elucidated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cellular delivery studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy demonstrated significant enhancements in cellular delivery only when 1&#8208;liposomes were incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showcase that lipid 1 exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.

         <title>Tailoring the NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence of Single Thiolated Au25 Nanoclusters by Selective Binding to Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocluster in a jewel case: A single, atomically precise gold nanocluster (Au25) has been incorporated inside bovine serum albumin protein. A striking increase in Au25&#8208;BSA NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence was observed as compared to Au25. The results reveal the intricate role of protein rigidification and the involvement of different excited states in the generation of NIR&#8208;II emissions. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Bona&#269;i&#263;&#8208;Kouteck&#253;, X. Le&#8197;Gu&#233;vel, R. Antoine, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200570).

         <title>Modeling Heme Peroxidase: Heme Saddling Facilitates Reactions with Hyperperoxides to Form High&#8208;Valent Fe(IV)&#8211;Oxo Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saddle&#8208;shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases, and how such macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of Fe(III) hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) to form high&#8208;valent Fe&#8211;oxo species remains uncertain. We investigated the reactions of two Fe(III) porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely Fe III (OETPP)ClO  4  (  1  OE  ) and Fe III (OMTPP)ClO  4  (  1  OM  ), with tert &#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (  t&#8208;  BuOOH) in CH 2 Cl 2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8211;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable Fe(III)&#8211;alkylperoxo intermediate, Fe III&#8211;O(H)OR (  2  ) into Fe(IV)&#8211;oxo porphyrins (  3  ) through examination of the ESI&#8208;MS spectra, absorption changes and 1 H NMR chemical shifts. Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [  t  &#8208;BuOOH]&#8208;dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40 &#176;C, the reaction of  1  OE  with t &#8208;BuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant ( K  a  = 362.3 M  &#8722;1  ) and rate constant ( k = 1.87 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  s  &#8722;1  ) for the homolytic cleavage of the  2  O&#8211;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times, respectively, those exhibited by 1 OM ( K  a  =171.8 M  &#8722;1  and k = 1.36 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  s  &#8722;1  ). DFT calculations indicated that an Fe(III) porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d  z2  ,d  x2&#8211;y2  )&#8211;porphyrin(a  2u  )]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8211;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8211;O cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesized Cd&#8208;Doped Cs3Cu2I5: Stable and Excitation&#8208;Wavelength Dependent Dual&#8208;Color Emission for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was synthesized by room&#8208;temperature grinding. [CuI4] and [CdI4] tetrahedrons act as photoluminescent centers separately, resulting in the emission colour manipulated by not only Cd feeding amount but also excitation wavelength. The as&#8208;prepared Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was made into anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink and printed on paper. The pattern shows different colours when the excitation wavelength increases from 310&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm.







Abstract
With the development of intellectual properties, concern about advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single&#8208;modal luminescence can no longer satisfy. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper&#8208;based perovskite shows great potential to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emissions. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs3Cu2I5 and showed resultant emission at 560&#8197;nm which surprisingly showed a red&#8208;shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self&#8208;trapped emission, resulting in excitation&#8208;wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increased from 290&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm, the emission of Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for silk&#8208;screen printing. Meanwhile, Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 maintains outstanding stability after doping, no matter under ambient, continuous UV radiation or high&#8208;temperature environment. The intensity can be almost totally recovered after heating&#8208;and&#8208;cooling cycles. This study lays groundwork for future research into multiple luminescent center manipulation in 0D materials.

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Nor&#8208;Cedrene and Nor&#8208;Isozizaene Sesquiterpenoids and Exploration of Their Olfactive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of isozizaene&#8208; and cedrene&#8208;type nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids from a simple bio&#8208;inspired precursor nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide is described. This key intermediate undergoes selective cyclization cascades without the need for enzymatic control. By choosing cationic or radical cyclization conditions, each sesquiterpene scaffold could be prepared selectively and led to the discovery of new woody odorants of perfumery interest.







Abstract
We report the preparation of nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide 13 and its use as a common biomimetic intermediate for the synthesis of nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids. Through a cationic cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;isozizaenol 25, ultimately constituting an eight&#8208;step access to this complex sesquiterpenoid from inexpensive and abundant starting materials. Using a radical cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;cedryl alcohol 26 from the same intermediate. Derivatization of these two products led to the discovery of two potent woody odorants of interest in perfumery.

         <title>Different Enzyme Conformations Induce Different Mechanistic Traits in HIV&#8208;1 Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence and divergence: Using multiple conformations (previously characterized by adiabatic methods) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, we assessed the convergence of activation free energies and the mechanistic divergence of the first step in the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease. The mechanistic divergence for this step was still present and our barriers spanned a range of 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The influence of the dynamical flexibility of enzymes on reaction mechanisms is a cornerstone in biological sciences. In this study, we aim to 1)&#8197;study the convergence of the activation free energy by using the first step of the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease as a case study, and 2)&#8197;provide further evidence for a mechanistic divergence in this enzyme, as two different reaction pathways were seen to contribute to this step. We used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, on four different initial conformations that led to different barriers in a previous study. Despite the sampling, the four activation free energies still spanned a range of 5.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, the new simulations did confirm the occurrence of an unusual mechanistic divergence, with two different mechanistic pathways displaying equivalent barriers. An active&#8208;site water molecule is proposed to influence the mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Dynamics of Naphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;based photon upconversion involves the fusion of two non&#8208;emissive triplet excited states into one singlet excited state. The TTA process in naphthalene is found to be mediated by conical intersection between the T1T1 and S1S0 states. The coupling of an optical cavity to a naphthalene dimer results in an increase in the efficiency of TTA&#8208;assisted photon upconversion process. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gudem and M. Kowalewski (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200781).

         <title>Bioinspired Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration by Covalently Metalated Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural photosynthesis is a highly unified biocatalytic system, which coupled cofactor (NAD(P)H) regeneration and enzymatic CO  2  reduction efficiently for solar energy conversion. Mimicking nature, a novel system with Rh complex covalently grafted onto NH  2  &#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitride (NH  2  &#8208;PCN) was constructed. The integrated connection of the light&#8208;harvesting and electron mediation modules as Rh  m3  &#8208;N&#8208;PCN could promote the efficient NAD  +  reduction to NADH. As a result, the integrated system exhibited a conversion of ~66% within 20 minutes. By further coupling in&#8208;situ generated NADH with formate&#160;dehydrogenase (FDH), a photoenzymatic production of formic acid (HCOOH) from CO  2  was accomplished. Moreover, by immobilizing FDH onto a hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production of ~5.0 mM can be obtained due to the concentrated CO  2  on the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface. Our work herein provides an integrated strategy for coupling the anchored electron mediator with immobilized enzyme for enhanced artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Between two chairs: Combination of theory and experiment for the determination of the conformational dynamics of xylosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Electrophilicities of Diazoalkanes: Kinetics and Mechanism of Azo Couplings with Enamines and Sulfonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetics and mechanism of the reactions of methyl diazoacetate, dimethyl diazomalonate, 4&#8208;nitrophenyldiazo&#173;methane, and diphenyldiazomethane with sulfonium ylides and enamines were investigated by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. Ordinary alkenes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with these diazo compounds. In contrast, sulfonium ylides and enamines attack at the terminal nitrogen of the diazo alkanes to give zwitterions, which undergo various subsequent reactions. As only one new bond is formed in the rate&#8208;determining step of these reactions, the correlation lg  k  2  (20 &#176;C) =  s  N  (  N  +  E  ) could be used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities  E  of the diazo compounds from the measured second&#8208;order rate constants and the known reactivity indices  N  and  s  N  of the sulfonium ylides and enamines. The resulting electrophilicity parameters (&#8211;21 &lt;  E  &lt; &#8232;&#8211;18), which are 11&#8211;14 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the benzenediazonium ion, are used to define the scope of one&#8208;bond nucleophiles which may react with these diazoalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry
Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystal of Ru(III) Complexes with Six
Imidazole&#8211;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new H&#8208;bonded crystal [Ru III (Him) 3 (Im) 3 ] with three
imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im &#8211; ) groups was prepared to
obtain a high&#8208;temperature proton conductor. The crystal is
constructed by complementary N&#8208;H&#8230;N H&#8208;bonds between the Ru III
complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic topology&#8208;net with a two&#8208;fold
interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton
conductivity of 3.08 &#197;~ 10 &#8211;5 S/cm at 450 K and faster conductivity than
those formed by only HIm groups. The high proton conductivity is
attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm
frameworks that are activated at ~113 K, but also isotropic wholemolecule
rotation of [Ru III (Him) 3 (Im) 3 ] at temperatures greater than
420 K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 2 H&#8208;NMR
spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and
theoretically considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate specific protein&#8722;protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate high pressure&#8208;sensitivity of globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The addition of excipients has a minor effect, only. The high pressure&#8208;sensitivity observed is due to the fact that these flexible Y&#8208;shaped molecules create a considerable amount of void volume in the condensed phase, leading to an overall decrease of the volume of the system upon dissociation of the droplet phase by pressure already at a few ten to hundred bar. Moreover, we show that immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly pressure resistant against unfolding and can even sustain pressures up to about 6 kbar without conformational changes. This implies that immunoglobulins are resistant to pressure treatment of foods, such as milk, in high&#8208;pressure food processing technologies, thereby preserving their immunological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Peri&#8208;Decoration of a Tetraazaperylene with Urea Units: Chiral Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) and their Optical and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (  OAPPDO  s) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core which is formally condensed with N&#8208;substituted urea units in the two opposite  peri  positions. Here, we report the synthesis of series of substituted  OAPPDO  derivatives, with different N&#8208;substitution patterns (H, alkyl, benzyl) in the  peri  positions, including  bay  chlorinated  OAPPDO  s. Starting from the latter, a series of  bay  arylated  OAPPDO  s has been synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling which resulted in the formation of helically chiral  OAPPDO  derivatives. The electrochemical and photo physical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. The  P  &#8208; and  M  &#8208;enantiomers of a phenylated  OAPPDO  were separated by semipreparative HPLC column chromatography and further analyzed by CD&#8208;spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies, the mechanism of the isomerization, the electronic excitation and the CD spectrum (TD&#8208;DFT) were computed and compared to the experimental data. The reversible 1e  &#8208;  oxidation of the  OAPPDO  s generates the corresponding radical cations, one of which was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The reversible oxidation process was also systematically investigated by spectroelectrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Electron Density Analysis of Chemical Bonding in Graphitic Carbon Nitride Precursor Melamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g&#8208;CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave&#8208;like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3 &#197; similar to that of g&#8208;CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction data measured at 25 K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra&#8208; and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions. Theoretical gas phase optimizations of the experimental molecular geometry show that bond lengths and angles for atoms in same chemical environment (C&#8208;N bonds in the ring, amine groups) differ significantly more for the experimental geometry than for the gas phase optimized geometries, indicating that intermolecular interactions in the crystal affects the molecular geometry. In the experimental crystal geometry, one amine group has significantly more sp  3  &#8208;like character than the others, hinting towards a possible formation mechanism of g&#8208;CN. Topological analysis and energy frameworks show that the nitrogen atom in this amine group participates in weak intralayer hydrogen bonding. We hypothesize that melamine condenses to g&#8208;CN within the layers and that the unique amine group plays a key role in the condensation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;based materials as lithium hosts for lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal has attracted significant attention in areas that range from basic research to various commercial applications due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h g&#8722;1  ) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, dendrites often form on the surfaces of Li metal anodes during cycling and thus lead to battery failure and, in some cases, raise safety concerns. To overcome this problem, a variety of approaches that vary the electrolyte, membrane, and/or anode have been proposed. Among these efforts, the use of three&#8208;dimensional frameworks as Li hosts, which can homogenize and minimize the current density at the anode surface, is an effective approach to suppress the formation of Li dendrites. Herein, we describe the development of using carbon&#8208;based materials as Li hosts. While these materials can be fabricated with a variety of porous structures, they have a number of intrinsic advantages including low cost, a high specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, wide electrochemical stability. After briefly summarizing the Li dendrites formation mechanisms, various methods for controlling structural and surface chemistry will be described for different types of carbon&#8208;based materials from the viewpoint of improving their performance as Li hosts. Finally, we provide perspective on the future development of Li host materials needed to meet the requirements for their use in flexible and wearable devices and other contemporary energy storage techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>A Red Light&#8208;Driven CO&#8208;releasing Complex: Photoreactivities and Excited&#8208;state Dynamics of Highly&#8208;Distorted Tricarbonyl Rhenium Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complex comprising one [Re(CO)3]+  unit and a phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand (Re1Pc) is shown to function as a photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule (photoCORM) in the presence of O2  and a coordinative solvent under irradiation with red light, which can deeply penetrate living tissues. Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements indicate very short excited&#8208;state lifetimes and ultrafast intersystem crossing for  Re1Pc  and  Re2Pc, which contains two [Re(CO)3]+  units. The excited&#8208;state properties are ascribed to efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and large Franck&#8208;Condon factors originating from the complexes&#8217; distorted structures, i.e., unsymmetric coordination of [Re(CO)3]+  unit(s), one of which was confirmed via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of a symmetrically&#8208;substituted Pc with two [Re(CO)3]+  units.  Re1Pc  represents a promising red light&#8208;driven photoCORM that can be applied in biological environments or therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity recognition of organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8211;BF&#160;3&#160;&#8211;) as designer guest molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recognition of boron compounds is well developed as boronic acids but untapped as organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8211;BF  3  &#8211;  ). We are exploring the development of these and other designer anions as anion&#8208;recognition motifs by considering them as substituted versions of the parent inorganic ion. To this end, we demonstrate strong and reliable binding of organic trifluoroborates, R&#8722;BF  3  &#8722;  , by cyanostar macrocycles that are size&#8208;complementary to the inorganic BF  4  &#8211;  &#160;progenitors. We find that recognition is modulated by the substituent&#8217;s sterics and that the affinities are retained using the common K  +  &#160;salts of R&#8211;BF  3  &#8211;  &#160;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;CF3 Imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one Derivatives via Photocatalytic and Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported methodologies open access to the mono&#8208;substituted N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones at the 4&#8208;position which was previously inaccessible. Directly from the linear N&#8208;CF3 ureas bearing an alkene moiety, N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones were prepared via Ag&#8208;catalysis and light assisted proton coupled electron transfer. Instead of prior modification of the alkene moiety, tandem PCET and Nickel catalysis were shown to increase the diversity of the core. The cyclic compounds were then treated under various conditions to modify the core structure to introduce structural complexity.







Abstract
While the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of cyclic ureas is of interest for the potential to fundamentally change the properties of these biologically relevant moieties, the single synthetic procedure known to date describing their access only gives 4,4&#8208;disubstituted or fused aromatic cyclic N&#8208;CF3 urea derivatives. We herein report an alternative approach to unleash access to the 4&#8208;monosubstituted imidazolidinone motif. The strategy relies on straightforward cyclization of readily accessible acyclic ureas, enabled by Ag&#8208;catalysis or light&#8208;assisted proton coupled electron transfer. The cyclic core is shown to be highly robust and amenable to various derivatizations, such as tandem Ni&#8208;catalysis, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C cross couplings or C&#8722;H functionalizations, tolerating basic, nucleophilic and/or oxidizing conditions.

         <title>Tuning Deazaflavins Towards Highly Potent Reducing Photocatalysts Guided by Mechanistic Understanding &#8211; Enhancement of the Key Step by the Internal Heavy Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature and based on mechanistic understanding, we designed deazaflavins (dFl) with reducing powers comparable to Li which function via the consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) mechanism independently on molecular oxygen. The internal heavy atom effect (IHAE) by introducing bromine into the photocatalyst enhances considerably the key triplet pathway via a triplet&#8208;born radical pair. Furthermore, an optimal concentration of the sacrificial electron donor (Ssac) is required for bypassing the unproductive reaction via the singlet&#8208;born radical pair.







Abstract
Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting via a consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8211; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8211; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions via a three&#8208;component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100&#8201;% triplet yield but causes photo&#8208;instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5&#8208;phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo&#8208; and chloroarenes with electron&#8208;donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.

         <title>Modulated Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modulated strategy was developed for the synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated method, the modulated approach changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times.







Abstract
The weak interaction of covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles makes the preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films difficult. Herein, a modulated strategy for the facile synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness is reported. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated approach, the modulated strategy changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times. Moreover, self&#8208;standing LZU&#8208;8 film can be used as a membrane for efficient removal of 99&#8201;% mercury ions from aqueous solution. Our results open up a new approach to prepare self&#8208;standing COF thin films for practical applications.

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Iron&#8208;Containing MRI Contrast Agent Sensor for H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe(II) complex with the macrocyclic quinol&#8208;containing ligand H4qp4 displays high water&#8208; and air&#8208;stability. The complex rapidly reacts with H2O2, but not O2, to yield Fe(III) complexes with oxidized ligands that contain para&#8208;quinone groups. Upon oxidation by H2O2, the r1 increases by over four&#8208;fold, enabling the Fe(II) complex to act as an MRI contrast agent sensor for this reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H4qp4 reacts with H2O2 to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two para&#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the T1&#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H2O2 using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H2O2, in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.

         <title>Development of bacterial enzyme&#8208;based biosensor for the detection and quantification of selenate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enzymatic biosensor has been developed for the determination of selenate (SeO  4  2&#8208;  ), in which selenate reductase (SeR) is chemically attached to a gold disk electrode by lipoic acid N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester as linker, allowing the catalytic reduction of the SeO  4  2&#8208;  to SeO  3  2&#8208;  . Modification of the gold electrode has been characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements have been performed in different buffers for selenate determination. Under optimum condition, the calibration curve was linear in range 7.0&#8208;3900.0 &#181;g/L with a limit of detection and quantification 4.97 and 15.56 &#181;g/L, respectively. The interference of the relevant oxyanions: SO  4  2&#8722;  , NO  3  &#8208;  , NO  2  &#8208;  , PO  4  3&#8208;  and AsO  4  3&#8208;  has been studied on the determination of SeO  4  2&#8208;  . Finally, the enzyme&#8208;modified surface has been used for the determination of SeO  4  2&#8208;  in different real water samples with a recovery of 95.2&#8208;102.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Cross Electrophile Coupling of Benzyl Bromides and Sulfonium Salts towards the Synthesis of Dihydro Stilbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalysed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl sulfonium salts and benzyl bromides is reported. Simple, stable and readily available sulfonium salts have shown their ability as leaving groups in cross electrophile coupling, allowing the formation of challenging sp3&#8208;sp3 carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, towards the synthesis of interesting dihydro stilbene derivatives. In addition, benzyl tosyl derivatives have been demonstrated to be suitable substrates for the reductive cross&#8208;coupling via  in situ  formation of the corresponding sulfonium salt.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;H and Si&#8208;H Activation Reactions at Ru/Ga Complexes: A&#160;Combined Experimental and Theoretical Case Study on the Ru&#8208;Ga Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of&#160; [Ru(COD)(MeAllyl)  2  ] and [Ru(COD)(COT)]&#160; with GaCp* under hydrogenolytic conditions leads to reactive intermediates which activate Si&#8208;H or C&#8208;H bonds, respectively. The product complexes [Ru(GaCp*)  3  (SiEt  3  )H  3  ] (  1  ) and [Ru(GaCp*)  3  (C  7  H  7  )H  3  ] (  2  ) are formed with HSiEt  3  or with toluene as the solvent, respectively. While&#160;  1  &#160;was isolated and fully characterized by NMR, MS, IR and SC&#8208;XRD,&#160;  2  &#160;was too labile to be isolated and was observed and characterized&#160;  in&#8208;situ  &#160;by using mass spectrometry, including labelling experiments for the unambiguous assignment of the elemental composition. The structural assignment was confirmed by DFT computations. The relative energies of the four isomers possible upon toluene activation at the&#160;  ortho  &#8208;,&#160;  meta  &#8208;,&#160;  para  &#8208; and CH  3  &#8208;positions have been determined and point&#160; to aromatic C&#8208;H activation.&#160;The Ru&#8208;Ga bond was analyzed by EDA and QTAIM and compared to the Ru&#8208;P bond in the analogue phosphine compound.&#160;Bonding analyses indicate that the Ru&#8208;GaCp* bond is weaker than the Ru&#8208;PR  3  &#160;bond.</dc:description>
