         <title>Gold Nanoclusters whose Photoluminescent Properties are Dynamically Tunable by Modulating the Assembly Pathway Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the assembly pathway is an indispensable strategy for optimizing the performance of optical materials. However, implementing this strategy is nontrivial for metal nanocluster building blocks, due to the limited functional modification of nanoclusters and complexity of their emission mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that a gold nanocluster modified by 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in methanol (MeOH)/water mixed solvent, thus exhibiting pathway complexity. Kinetic studies show that DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamicallycontrolled). In&#8208;depth analysis of the assembly mechanism reveals that the transformation of aggregation structures involves the disassembly of nanofibers and a subsequent nucleation&#8208;growth process. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) measurements reveal that inter&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding bridged by solvent molecules and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction are the key factors for emission enhancement. The photoluminescent property of DPT&#8208;AuNCs can be controlled by varying the cosolvent in water, enabling DPT&#8208;AuNCs to distinguish different kind of alcohols, particularly the isomerism n&#8208;propanol (NPA) and isopropanol (IPA). Additionally, he addition of seeds effectively regulate the assembly kinetics of DPT&#8208;AuNCs. This study advances our understanding of assembly pathways and improves the luminescent performance of nanoclusters (NCs).</dc:description>

         <title>A peptide strategy for inhibiting different protein aggregation pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation&#8208;prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8208;30% flexible, 30&#8208;40% aliphatic and 20&#8208;30% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington&#8217;s disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early aggregation stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross&#8208;mechanistic, multi&#8208;targeting aggregation inhibitors may be lead compounds for developing drug candidates against various protein aggregation diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>A Broadened Class of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacked Macrometallacyclic Adducts of Different Coinage Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theory&#8208;guided synthetic design of a family of dissimilar cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTC@CTC&#8217;) with tunable bonding/optoelectronic properties is reported herein, attaining record&#8208;short intermolecular distances for d10 complexes (2.868(2) &#197;) and rather&#8208;high solution binding constants (4.67&#215;105&#8197;L/mol). Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;luminescence properties suggest metal&#8208;centered phosphorescent emissions with properties suitable for future smart materials/devices.







Abstract
A yet&#8208;outstanding supramolecular chemistry challenge is isolation of novel varieties of stacked complexes with finely&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;acceptor bonding and optoelectronic properties, as herein reported for binary adducts comprising two different cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTC@CTC&#8217;). Most previous attempts focused only on 1&#8211;2 factors among metal/ligand/substituent combinations, resulting in heterobimetallic complexes. Instead, here we show that, when all 3 factors are carefully considered, a broadened variety of CTC@CTC&#8217; stacked pairs with intuitively&#8208;enhanced intertrimer coordinate&#8208;covalent bonding strength and ligand&#8208;ligand/metal&#8208;ligand dispersion are attained (dM&#8211;M&#8217; 2.868(2) &#197;; &#916;E&gt;50&#8197;kcal/mol, an order of magnitude higher than aurophilic/metallophilic interactions). Significantly, CTC@CTC&#8217; pairs remain intact/strongly&#8208;bound even in solution (Keq 4.67&#215;105&#8197;L/mol via NMR/UV&#8208;vis titrations), and the gas phase (mass spectrometry revealing molecular peaks for the entire CTC@CTC&#8217; units in sublimed samples), rather than simple co&#8208;crystal formation. Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;luminescence studies unravel metal&#8208;centered phosphorescence useful for novel all metal&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (MOLEDs) optoelectronic device concepts. This work manifests systematic design of supramolecular bonding and multi&#8208;faceted spectral properties of pure metal&#8208;organic macrometallacyclic donor/acceptor (inorganic/inorganic) stacks with remarkably&#8208;rich optoelectronic properties akin to well&#8208;established organic/organic and organic/inorganic analogues.

         <title>Exploiting Mixed Valence Charge Transfer for Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Use</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsymmetric donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 was leveraged to decipher Class&#8208;II mixed valence charge transfer. This conjugated D&#8722;A&#8208;D fluorophore had a strong IVCT at 1500&#8197;nm upon chemical and electrochemical oxidation. This NIR absorption and fluorescence modulation were ideal for electro and eletrofluorochromics.







Abstract
An asymmetric mixed valence fluorophore with two different electron rich termini was investigated as a dual&#8208;role active material for electrochromism and electrofluorochromism. The fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl) and emission wavelength of the fluorophore were dependent on solvent polarity. The quantum yield of the material in an electrolyte gel, on a glass substrate and in a device was 40&#8201;%, 20&#8201;% and 13&#8201;% respectively. The fluorophore further underwent two near&#8208;simultaneous electrochemical oxidations. The first oxidation resulted in a 1000&#8197;nm red shift in the absorption to broadly absorb in the NIR, corresponding to the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT). Whereas the second oxidation led to a perceived green color at 715&#8197;nm with the extinction of the NIR absorbing IVCT. Owing to the dissymmetry of the fluorophore along with its two unique oxidation sites, the IVCT gives rise to a mixed valence transfer charge (MVCT). The coloration efficiency of the fluorophore in both solution and a device was 1433 and 200&#8197;cm2&#8201;C&#8722;1, respectively. The fluorescence intensity could be reversibly modulated electrochemically. The photoemission intensity of the fluorophore was modulated with applied potential in an operating electrochromic/electrofluorochromic device. Both the dual electrochromic and the electrofluorochromic behavior of the fluorophore were demonstrated.

         <title>Photoinduced Transition&#8208;MetalExternal Photosensitizer Free Benzylic Fluorination of Unactivated Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and efficient protocol for the direct monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed, without any extraneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts or photosensitizers. This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality.

This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram-scale synthesis of a fluorine-containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that a single-electron transfer mechanism might be responsible for the generation of the benzylic radicals in initiation step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Octopus and the CLICK Procedure in Columnar Liquid Crystal Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two star&#8208;shaped mesogens with a (meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato) zinc (II) core and bithiophene conjugated arms with 3,4,5&#8208;trisdodecyloxyphenyl periphery were synthesized. One of these molecules was decorated with four fullerenes via an aliphatic spacer. This is the sterically overcrowded compound with an octapodal morphology. The other star lacks the fullerenes and provides free space between the conjugated arms. This mesogen does not aggregate in solution, but in solid state it forms a hexagonal columnar and a highly ordered oblique helical columnar phase, while the octopus molecule assemble in an amorphous solid. Photophysical studies of the octapodal compound in solution and the solid thin film reveal the formation of J&#8208;type aggregates, in which the interaction between donors (porphyrin) and acceptors (fullerene) dominates leading to absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectra. The mixture of both compounds results in a self&#8208;assembly which is called the Click procedure. Fullerenes of the octopus nanosegregate in the pockets of the star mesogens generating hexagonal columnar structures with a regular stacking along the columnar axis. Thus providing free space is a tool to control the competition between supramolecular interactions and nanosegregation. Such liquid&#8208;crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor structures may play a role in future LC photovoltaic applications.</dc:description>

Abstract
Carbon dots (C&#8208;dots) obtained from D&#8208;glucose have attracted great interest because of their properties and as a model for understanding the synthesis process and the origin of photoluminescence in carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. Synthesising C&#8208;dots under hydrothermal conditions has become one of the most common methods for their preparation. Understanding the details of this process is quite difficult. To tackle this challenge, we have adopted a multi&#8208;technique approach in our present work. We have correlated different spectroscopic analyses, such as infrared, Raman, fluorescence, NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis, to connect the emissions with specific chemical groups. In particular, in&#8197;situ infrared analysis as a function of temperature has allowed following the formation of C=C, C=O, and COOH species and the rise of specific emissions. Only weak emissions due to n&#8208;&#960;* transitions are detected upon post&#8208;synthesis thermal annealing.

         <title>The Role of Lysozyme in the Formation of Bioinspired Silicon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of formation of silica templated by lysozyme is here interrogated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results strongly suggest that the &#8211; densely charged &#8211; protein electrostatically attracts the precursor and can thus accelerate the polycondensation reaction by increasing its concentration.







Abstract
Several organisms are able to polycondensate tetraoxosilicic(IV) acid to form silicon(IV) dioxide using polycationic molecules. According to an earlier mechanistic proposal, these molecules undergo a phase separation and recent experimental evidence appears to confirm this model. At the same time, polycationic proteins like lysozyme can also promote polycondensation of silicon(IV) dioxide, and they do so under conditions that are not compatible with liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. In this manuscript we investigate this conundrum by molecular simulations.

         <title>Stable CAAC&#8208;Triazenes: A New Nitrogen Ligand System With Donor and Conformational Flexibility, and With Application in Olefin Activation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusually stable: Triazenes stabilized with a cyclic (amino)(alkyl)carbene are readily accessible, remarkably stable towards thermal N2 loss and undergo partially reversible E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization. They offer a large &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and through all three nitrogens and, when used as ligand to palladium, impart high catalytic activity in olefin oligomerization and double bond migration.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic imines such as pyridylidene amines impart high catalytic activity when coordinated to a transition metal, largely imposed by their electronic flexibility. Here, this donor flexibility has been applied for the first time to CAAC&#8208;based systems through the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;triazenes. These new ligands offer a larger &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene through three nitrogens rather than just one, as observed in N&#8208;heterocyclic imines. We demonstrate the straightforward synthesis of three new CAAC&#8208;triazenes containing different substituents on the terminal triazene nitrogen. These compounds are remarkably stable up to 120&#8201;&#176;C without loss of N2 as typically observed with similar triazenes. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization within the triazene is instigated by UV light and is partially reversible dependent on the triazene substituent. The quinoline&#8208;substituted CAAC&#8208;triazene 1&#8208;Q has been applied as an L,L&#8217;&#8208;type ligand in the synthesis of [PdCl2(1&#8208;Q)], [PdCl(Me)(1&#8208;Q)] and [Pd(Me)(H2O(1&#8208;Q)]+. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z ligand isomerization also occurs when coordinated to PdCl2, providing access to on&#8208;metal manipulation. The cationic complex [PdMe(H2O)(1&#8208;Q)]+ is a precatalyst for oligomerization of ethylene to form initially 2&#8208;butene and subsequently linear and branched C8&#8722;C12 products from butene activation. Moreover, isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene takes place efficiently with exceptionally low catalyst loading (10&#8197;ppm) and up to 74,000 turnover numbers.

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Metalation on the Ionic TiO2 Surface to Enhance Metal&#8208;CO2 Interaction During Photochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;Modification for CO2 Reduction. The ionic surface of a polyoxometalate stabilized 6&#8197;nm photoactive TiO2 nanocore allows post&#8208;synthetic copper exchange on the surface of the nanoparticles. Copper(II) ions on the surface show enhanced CO2 adsorption and act as the reactive center to transfer photoexcited electrons to stabilize the M&#8208;[CO2]&#8722; intermediate, detected by quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ Raman and labeling study, which has earlier been speculated as the reactive species to direct the selectivity of photochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
During the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 adsorption on the catalyst's surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal&#8208;CO2] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO2 nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]x@TiO2), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs&#8217; charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cux[POM]@TiO2). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO2 core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs&#8217; surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo&#8208;harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of CuII/I and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction potentials. Photochemical CO2 reduction with Cux[POM]@TiO2 results in 30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1 CO (79&#8201;%) and 8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 of CH4 (21&#8201;%). Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ Raman study provides evidence in support of CO2 adsorption on the Cux[POM]@TiO2 surface. 13C and D2O labeling studies affirm the {Cu&#8208;[CO2]&#8722;} adduct formation. Despite the photo&#8208;harvesting ability of Nax[POM]@TiO2 itself, the poor CO2 adsorption ability of sodium ions highlights the crucial role of copper ion CO2 photo&#8208;reduction. Characterization of the {M&#8208;[&#951;2&#8208;CO2]&#8722;} species via surface tuning validates the CO2 activation and photochemical reduction pathway proposed earlier.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-Modification for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction&lt;/b&gt;. The ionic surface of a polyoxometalate stabilized 6&#8197;nm photoactive TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocore allows post-synthetic copper exchange on the surface of the nanoparticles. Copper(II) ions on the surface show enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and act as the reactive center to transfer photoexcited electrons to stabilize the M-[CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate, detected by quasi-in-situ Raman and labeling study, which has earlier been speculated as the reactive species to direct the selectivity of photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption on the catalyst's surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs&#8217; charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[POM]@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs&#8217; surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo-harvesting efficiency of the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of Cu&lt;sup&gt;II/I&lt;/sup&gt; and multi-electron CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction potentials. Photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[POM]@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in 30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; CO (79&#8201;%) and 8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>In Silico Design and Characterization of a New Molecular Electride: Li@Calix[3]Pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present Li@calix[3]pyrrole, the newest member of the molecular electride family. Electron density, electron localization function, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses confirm the presence of a localized electride electron in the void adjacent to the pyrrole N&#8722;H groups. The origin of the electride character and the bonding environment are elucidated by electron decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Electrides, in which anionic electrons are localized independently of the atoms in the compound, have shown promise, especially as catalysts and optoelectronic materials. Here, we present a new computationally designed molecular electride, Li@calix[3]pyrrole (Li@C3P). Electron density and electron localization function analyses unequivocally confirm the existence of localized electride electron density, outside the system, independent of any specific atoms. Non&#8208;covalent interaction plots further validate the character of the isolated localized electron, suggesting that the system can be accurately represented by Li+@calix[3]pyrrole&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;e&#8722;, denoting its distinct charge separation. The remarkable non&#8208;linear optical properties of Li@C3P, including average polarizability,

Furthermore, energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence theory sheds light on the mechanism of electron density transfer from Li to the C3P cage, yielding the charge&#8208;separated Li@C3P complex. In addition to the electron transfer, a key factor to its electride nature is the electronic structure of the CnP cage, which has its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital located in the void adjacent to the N&#8722;H groups at the back of the bowl&#8208;shaped CnP cage.

We present here the encapsulation of an FeII spin crossover complex C1 inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows a reversible solvatochromism under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex.







Abstract
We present here the encapsulation of a spin crossover complex C1 [FeII(L)] (L: 4&#8208;amino&#8208;, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylmethylene)hydrazide) inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows solvatochromism under Volatile Organic compounds (VOCs) sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex. More specifically, this compound shows an interesting reversible color change under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption and can therefore be considered as a new kind of optical VOCs chemosensor, opening new doors for developing a broad range of VOCs optical sensors.

         <title>Characterizing the Oligomers Distribution along the Aggregation Pathway of Amyloid A&#946;1&#8208;40 by NMR</title>

A&#946;1&#8208;40 seed&#8208;free sample is recovered after rapid isomerization of 26&#8208;O&#8208;acyl isoA&#946;1&#8208;40 at neutral pH. NMR 1D 1H spectra and diffusion measurements collected over time, coupled with their analysis through the Inverse Laplace Transform reconstruction method, detect changes in the oligomeric distribution along the aggregation pathway of amyloid A&#946;1&#8208;40. The presented approach emerges as a valuable tool in drug discovery.







Abstract
This study delves into the early aggregation process of the A&#946;1&#8208;40 amyloid peptide, elucidating the associated oligomers distribution. Motivated by the acknowledged role of small oligomers in the neurotoxic damage linked to Alzheimer's disease, we present an experimental protocol for preparing 26&#8208;O&#8208;acyl isoA&#946;1&#8208;40, a modified A&#946;1&#8208;40 peptide facilitating rapid isomerization to the native amide form at neutral pH. This ensures seed&#8208;free solutions, minimizing experimental variability. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of coupling NMR diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) with the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) reconstruction method, for effective characterization of early aggregation processes. This innovative approach efficiently maps oligomers distributions across a wide spectrum of initial peptide concentrations offering unique insights into the evolution of oligomers relative populations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach assessing the impact of Epigallocathechin gallate, a known remodeling agent of amyloid fibrils, on the oligomeric distributions of aggregated A&#946;1&#8208;40. The DOSY&#8208;ILT proposed approach stands as a robust and discriminating asset, providing a powerful strategy for rapidly gaining insight into potential inhibitors&#8217; impact on the aggregation process.

         <title>Grain Boundary Defect Engineering in Rutile Iridium Oxide Boosts Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>

Joule heating pretreatment and carbon templates are used to construct grain boudary&#8208;rich IrO2 nanoparticles for promoting acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The assembled proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) with the optimized catalyst (350&#8208;IrO2) exhibits high activity (1.68&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1.84&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stability (100&#8197;h at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is considered a promising technology for coupling with renewable energy sources to achieve clean hydrogen production. However, constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the acidic abominable environment render the grand challenges in developing the active and stable OER electrocatalyst, leading to low efficiency of PEMWE. Herein, we develop the rutile&#8208;type IrO2 nanoparticles with abundant grain boundaries and the continuous nanostructure through the joule heating and sacrificial template method. The optimal candidate (350&#8208;IrO2) demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability during the OER, presenting a promising advancement for efficient PEMWE. DFT calculations verified that grain boundaries can modulate the electronic structure of Ir sites and optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, resulting in the accelerated kinetics. 350&#8208;IrO2 affords a rapid OER process with 20&#8197;times higher mass activity (0.61&#8197;A mgIr&#8722;1) than the commercial IrO2 at 1.50&#8197;V vs. RHE. Benefiting from the reduced overpotential and the preservation of the stable rutile structure, 350&#8208;IrO2 exhibits the stability of 200&#8197;h test at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only trace decay of 11.8&#8197;mV. Moreover, the assembled PEMWE with anode 350&#8208;IrO2 catalyst outputs the current density up to 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only 1.84&#8197;V applied voltage, long&#8208;term operation for 100&#8197;h without obvious performance degradation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface stress response of a crystal influences its performance characteristics. We develop, test and apply a new atomistic model for computing the surface elastic properties of molecular crystals. The model was used to support the experimental discovery of a stiff molecular crystal of L&#8211;aspartic acid whose morphology, facet and nanomechanical properties were all correctly predicted prior to experiments.







Abstract
Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of crystalline materials that can respond to mechanical stress by dissipating internal strain in a number of ways. Given the serendipitous nature of the discovery of such crystals, progress in the field requires advances in computational methods for the accurate and high&#8211;throughput computation of the nanomechanical properties of crystals on specific facets which are exposed to mechanical stress. Here, we develop and apply a new atomistic model for computing the surface elastic moduli of crystals on any set of facets of interest using dispersion&#8211;corrected density functional theory (DFT&#8722;D) methods. The model was benchmarked against a total of 24 reported nanoindentation measurements from a diverse set of molecular crystals and was found to be generally reliable. Using only the experimental crystal structure of the dietary supplement, L&#8211;aspartic acid, the model was subsequently applied under blind test conditions, to correctly predict the growth morphology, facet and nanomechanical properties of L&#8211;aspartic acid to within the accuracy of the measured elastic stiffness of the crystal, 24.53&#177;0.56&#8197;GPa. This work paves the way for the computational design and experimental realization of other functional molecular crystals with tailor&#8211;made mechanical properties.

         <title>Ionic Porous Aromatic Frameworks Embedding Polyoxometalates for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>

Multivariate ionic porous aromatic framework (MTV&#8208;iPAFs) material (PAF&#8208;270) was synthesized from a multivariable synthesis strategy, which specific surface area was 724&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and had hierarchical structure. Leveraging its physical and chemical properties, PAF&#8208;270 was availability for polyoxometalates loading and heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are highly promising functional porous solids known for their feasible amenability and extraordinary stability. When the framework was modified by ionic functional groups, these ionic PAFs (iPAFs) exhibited charged channels for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, the surface areas of ionic porous frameworks are usually lower than that of neutral frameworks, and their synthesis is limited by specific strategies and complex modification processes. To address these challenges, an intuitive route to construct ionic porous framework with high specific surface area was proposed. Herein, a multivariate ionic porous aromatic framework (MTV&#8208;iPAFs, named PAF&#8208;270) was synthesized using readily available building units with ionic functional groups through a multivariable synthesis strategy. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited hierarchical structure with the highest specific surface area among reported imidazolium&#8208;functionalized PAFs. Utilizing its physical and chemical properties, the availability for polyoxometalate loading and heterogeneous catalysis of PAF&#8208;270 were explored. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited a high adsorption capacity up to 50&#8201;% for both H3O40PW12 (HPW) and (NH4)5H6PV8Mo4O40 (V8). HPW@PAF&#8208;270 and V8@PAF&#8208;270 exhibited excellent catalytic abilities for oleic acid esterification and extractive oxidative desulfurization, respectively. Due to the stability of PAFs, these materials also showed remarkable resistance to temperature and pH changes. Overall, these results underscore the potential application of MTV&#8208;iPAFs as versatile functional porous materials.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes with Benzoxazole Derivatives and Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Effective Antioxidants in Human Neuroblasts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of benzoxazole derivatives with non&#8208;innocent ligands in the same ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex is a suitable strategy to design new pharmacological tools with ROS&#8208;scavenging activity against pro&#8208;apoptotic/pro&#8208;oxidant molecules challenge in human differentiated neuroblasts. The antioxidant properties of such systems are likely the result of a non&#8208;trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures. The decrease of oxidative stress by these ruthenium(II) systems exerts both pro&#8208;survival effect and anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in human differentiated neuroblasts.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes continue to raise increasing interest for the encouraging results in several biomedical areas. Considering their vast chemical&#8208;physical repertoire, in particular the possibility to switch from the sensitization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to ROS&#8208;scavenging abilities by tuning the nature of their ligands, it is therefore surprising that their potential as antioxidants has not been largely investigated so far. Herein, we explored the antioxidant behaviour of the novel ruthenium compound [Ru(dbpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru1), featuring a benzoxazole derivative (dpby=2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;benzoxazolyl)pyridine) and the non&#8208;innocent 2,3&#8208;diamminonaftalene (2,3&#8208;DAN) ligand, along with the reference tpy&#8208;containing analogue [Ru(tpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru2) (tpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine). Following the synthesis and the electrochemical characterization, chemical antioxidant assays highlighted the beneficial role of dpby for the ROS&#8208;scavenging properties of Ru1. These data have been corroborated by the highest protective effect of Ru1 against the oxidative stress induced in SH&#8208;SY5Y human neuroblastoma, which exerts pro&#8208;survival and anti&#8208;inflammatory actions. The results herein reported highlight the potential of Ru1 as pharmacological tool in neurodegenerative diseases and specially prove that the antioxidant properties of such compounds are likely the result of a non&#8208;trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures.

Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes known to favor protein crystallization. Herein, we explore the effect of the introduction of pendant arms at the free amino position of the TACN macrocycle on the nucleating properties and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation, and highlighted the potential of the V1 variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm.







Abstract
Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes that have demonstrated outstanding induction of crystallization for various proteins. This article explores the effect of tailored modifications of the crystallophore first generation and their impact on the nucleating properties and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation G1. In particular, the V1 variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm, demonstrated the ability to produce new crystallization conditions for the proteins tested (hen&#8208;egg white lysozyme, proteinase K and thaumatin). Structural analysis performed in the case of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme along with Molecular Dynamics simulations, highlights V1&#8242;s unique behavior, taking advantage of the flexibility of its propanol arm to explore different protein surfaces and form versatile supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Functionalized Anthracene Carboximides as Multivalent Ligands and Bio&#8208;Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbohydrate&#8208;conjugated anthracene carboximides (ACI glycosides) are synthesized which displayed excellent optical properties such as strong fluorescence, large Stokes shift in aq. solution, along with an increased aq. solubility. ACI glycosides show minimal cytotoxicity and are cell permeable as evidenced by the intracellular fluorescence. The glycosides self&#8208;assemble in aq. solutions, forming large vesicular structures and act as a multivalent glycocluster, showing specific lectin binding.







Abstract
Anthracene carboximides (ACIs) conjugated with gluco&#8208;, galacto&#8208; and mannopyranosides are synthesized, by glycosylation of N&#8208;hydroxyethylanthracene carboximide acceptor with glycosyl donors. Glycoconjugation of anthracene carboximide increases the aq. solubility by more than 3&#8208;fold. The glycoconjugates display red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, as compared to anthracene. Large Stokes shift (&#955;abs/&#955;em=445/525&#8197;nm) and high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;) of 0.86 and 0.5 occur in THF and water, respectively. The ACI&#8208;glycosides undergo facile photodimerization in aqueous solutions, leading to the formation of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer, as a mixture of syn and anti&#8208;isomers. Solution phase and solid&#8208;state characterizations by dynamic light scattering (DLS), microscopic imaging by atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopies reveal self&#8208;assembled vesicle structures of ACI glycosides. These self&#8208;assembled structures act as multivalent glycoclusters for ligand&#8208;specific lectin binding, as evidenced by the binding of Man&#8208;ACI to Con A, by fluorescence and turbidity assays. The conjugates do not show cellular cytotoxicity (IC50) till concentrations of 50&#8197;&#956;M with HeLa and HepG2&#8197;cell lines and are cell&#8208;permeable, showing strong fluorescence inside the cells. These properties enable the glycoconjugates to be used in cell imaging. The non&#8208;selective cellular uptake of the glycoconjugates suggests a passive diffusion through the membrane.

         <title>Synthesis and Performance of Bio&#8208;Based Amphoteric Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of sustainable bio&#8208;based surfactants was explored derived from biomass monosaccharides. Amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide containing surfactants were prepared through a simple oxidation process. These carbohydrate&#8208;based surfactants showed comparable properties performance to their commercially applied benchmarks. These bio&#8208;based alternatives offered a reduced skin irritation potential rapid biodegradability, increased viscosity, making them good candidates for the formulation of bio&#8208;based personal care products.







Abstract
As the global surfactant market continues to expand, there is an increasing need to develop bio&#8208;based alternatives in the shift towards a circular economy. This study focuses on the synthesis of polar, amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide surfactants starting from biomass&#8208;derived monosaccharides and demonstrating their potential in various applications. The synthesis involved a reductive amination of the sugars with an alkylamine and formaldehyde followed by oxidation to produce N&#8208;oxide surfactants. These bio&#8208;based surfactants exhibited promising properties, including high solubility, foamability, surface tension reduction, and critical micelle concentration. In particular, N&#8208;GalA1.10 and N&#8208;GalA1.12 showed comparable performance to commercial surfactants. Furthermore, these bio&#8208;based surfactants demonstrated significantly lower skin irritation potential when compared to petrochemical&#8208;derived counterparts like sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), making them potentially suitable for personal care products. The biodegradability assessment revealed that N&#8208;GalA1.12 exhibited good biodegradation, indicating its potential environmental compatibility. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of bio&#8208;based N&#8208;oxide surfactants derived from monosaccharides as sustainable and skin&#8208;friendly alternatives to traditional amphoteric surfactants, like cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB).

Platinum&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) proceeds at lower temperature in water; mono&#8208;cyclization proceeds selectively in the fjord region of PAH to give CP&#8208;PAH products.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) via Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization in water, focusing on the formation of fused pentagonal rings within heavily fused PAH frameworks. Utilizing platinum catalysts at lower temperatures (200&#8208;260&#8201;&#176;C) in water, led to the successful synthesis of singly cyclized CP&#8208;PAHs. The reaction conditions facilitated the mono&#8208;cyclization of substrates such as dibenzo[g,p]chrysene and its isomers, yielding the desired products while suppressing the formation of bis&#8208;cyclized compounds. The use of Fe2O3 as an additive in conjunction with PtO2 was effective to suppress hydrogenation of the substrates and products. The products exhibited a redshift in UV&#8208;visible absorption and photoluminescence bands due to a decrease in the HOMO&#8722;LUMO energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization for the controlled synthesis of CP&#8208;PAHs, with implications for various applications in materials science.

The crosslinked Tyr&#8208;Leu&#8208;Trp peptide produced by the biarylitide crosslinking cytochrome P450Blt from Micromonospora sp. MW&#8208;13 has been reanalysed by NMR, computational and isotope labelling experiments and shown to contain a C&#8722;N rather than a C&#8722;O bond. In vivo experiments using this peptide show there is a general tolerance of biarylitide crosslinking P450 enzymes for histidine to tryptophan mutations within their minimal peptide substrate sequences.







Abstract
The structure of the sidechain crosslinked Tyr&#8208;Leu&#8208;Trp peptide produced by the biarylitide crosslinking cytochrome P450Blt from Micromonospora sp. MW&#8208;13 has been reanalysed by a series of NMR, computational and isotope labelling experiments and shown to contain a C&#8722;N rather than a C&#8722;O bond. Additional in&#8197;vivo experiments using such a modified peptide show there is a general tolerance of biarylitide crosslinking P450 enzymes for histidine to tryptophan mutations within their minimal peptide substrate sequences despite the lack of such residues noted in natural biarylitide gene clusters. This work further highlights the impressive ability of P450s from biarylitide biosynthesis pathways to act as biocatalysts for the formation of a range of sidechain crosslinked tripeptides.

         <title>Chiral Induction in a Self&#8208;Assembled Pd4 Coordination Cage with Chiral Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of achiral precursors, cis&#8208;(tmen)Pd(NO3)2 and C2&#8208;symmetric ligand produces a racemic mixture of chiral octahedral cage. The cage encapsulates several hydrophobic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions with the aromatic walls. Intermolecular chiral induction has been achieved by encapsulation of enantiopure chiral guests within the cage resulting selective formation of a single homochiral assembly.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of coordination bonds within metal&#8208;organic cages offers a unique avenue for structural evolution in response to external stimuli, presenting a promising strategy for the construction of chiral assemblies. This adaptability is crucial for the selective synthesis of homochiral assemblies and advancement of asymmetric catalysis. In this study, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral square&#8208;planar Pd(II) acceptor with a C2&#8208;symmetric tetrapyridyl donor resulted in the formation of a racemic mixture of the chiral octahedral cage Pd4L2. The existence of this racemic mixture was confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We encoded chiral information into the asymmetric cavity of the cage by encapsulating chiral aromatic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media. The inclusion of a chiral guest induces a preference for one enantiomeric conformation of the cage over the other, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards a single, enantiopure host&#8208;guest complex. While the concept of chiral guest recognition by a chiral host is well&#8208;established, this work constitutes a remarkable example of guest&#8208;mediated chirality transfer leading to the formation of a single enantiopure coordination complex from achiral building blocks.

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline) Amphiphilicity Tunes the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer of Pyrenol&#8208;Based Polyphotoacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photo&#8208;responsive nature of polyphotoacids for their applicability in targeted release of cargo depends on an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) step and therefore on the hydration of the local environment. Hence this contribution provides a mechanistic understanding of ESPT in polyoxazoline&#8208;based polymers with varying degrees of hydration with pyrenol as the photoacid of choice.







Abstract
The ability of light to change the properties of light&#8208;responsive polymers opens avenues for targeted release of cargo with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. Recently, we established photoacid polymers as light&#8208;switchable macromolecular amphiphiles. In these systems, light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) causes changes in amphilicity. However, as the intermolecular process itself critically depends on the local environment of the photoacid unit within the polymer, the overall amphiphilicity directly influences ESPT. Thus, understanding the impact of the local environment on the photophysics of photoacidic side chains is key to material design. In this contribution we address both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of ESPT in oxazoline&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers with pyrenol&#8208;based photoacid side chains. We will compare the effect of polymer design, i.&#8201;e. statistical and block arrangements, i.&#8201;e. in poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;(6/8&#8208;hydroxyperene)sulphonylaziridine)] and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;block&#8208;poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(2&#8208;(3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxypyrene)sulphonamide)propyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), on the intermolecular proton transfer reaction by combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. ESPT appears more prominent in the statistical copolymer compared to a block copolymer with overall similar pyrenol loading. We hypothesize that the difference is due to different local chain arrangements adopted by the polymers in the two cases.

         <title>Unidentical Twins: Geometrically Similar but Chemically Distinct Metal&#8208;Free Sites in Boron Oxide for Methane Oxidation to HCHO, CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>

Unidentical Twins: The B2O3 surface contains various geometrically similar sites to carry out methane oxidation in presence of dioxygen. Computational descriptors were employed to distinct these identical twin sites. In methane oxidation, the rate&#8208;determining step for one site is the co&#8208;activation of dioxygen and methane, whereas formaldehyde formation is the rate&#8208;determining step over the other site. These sites prefer the formation of CO over CO2.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free boron&#8208;based catalysts such as boron oxide (B2O3) and boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are promising catalysts for methane oxidation to HCHO and CO. The B2O3 catalyst contains various probable boron sites (B1 to B6), which may be responsible for methane oxidation. In this work, we utilized density functional theory to compare two relevant geometrically identical boron sites (B2 and B4) for their reactivities. The two sites are explored in&#8208;detail for the conversion of methane to formaldehyde (M2F), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The B4 site activates the methane C&#8722;H bond easily as compared to the B2 site. In M2F conversion, the rate&#8208;determining step for the B2 site is the co&#8208;activation of dioxygen and methane, whereas over the B4 site, formaldehyde formation is the rate&#8208;determining step. The computationally&#8208;determined RDS for the B4 site coincides well with the reported experiments. It is further revealed that this site also prefers the formation of CO over CO2, which is in&#8208;line with the experiments in literature. It is also shown through orbital analysis that methanol formation does not occur during methane oxidation. We employed descriptors such as condensed Fukui functions and global electrophilicity index to chemically distinct these twin sites.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Novel Water&#8208;Soluble Cationic Platinum(II) Organometallic Complexes with Phenanthroline and Imidazolic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>

We reported the synthesis of monofunctional platinum(II) complexes for anticancer evaluation. Remarkably, complex 4 demonstrated the most pronounced cytotoxicity across both cancer (HeLa and Caki&#8208;1) and normal cell lines (HK&#8208;2). In contrast, complex 3 displayed superior selectivity for tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2) among the examined complexes. So, complex 3 signifies a lead entity in a promising class of antitumor agents.







Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents are widely used in the treatment of cancer. However, their effectiveness is limited by severe adverse reactions, drug resistance, and poor water solubility. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of new water&#8208;soluble cationic monofunctional platinum(II) complexes starting from the [PtCl(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)] (1, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) precursor, specifically [Pt(NH3)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (2), [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (3), and [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (4), which deviate from traditional requirements for antitumor activity. These complexes were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects in comparison to cisplatin, using immortalized cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), human renal carcinoma cells (Caki&#8208;1), and normal human renal cells (HK&#8208;2). While complex 2 showed minimal effects on the cell lines, complexes 3 and 4 demonstrated higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin. Notably, complex 4 displayed the highest cytotoxicity in both cancer and normal cell lines. However, complex 3 exhibited the highest selectivity for renal tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) among the tested complexes, compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2). This resulted in a significantly higher selectivity than that of cisplatin and complex 4. Therefore, complex 3 shows potential as a leading candidate for the development of a new generation of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, utilizing biocompatible imidazole ligands while demonstrating promising anticancer properties.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework/Polyimide Mixed Matrix Membrane for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering defects on the Zr&#8208;fumarate MOF by heating the as&#8208;synthesized material at 320 &#176;C creates open Zr coordination sites, which improve its performance as the filler in mixed matrix membranes for CO2 separation, increasing both the permeability and selectivity over the Robeson upper bound for CO2/CH4 separation.







Abstract
Defect&#8208;engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with outstanding structural and chemical features have become excellent candidates for specific separation applications. The introduction of structural defects in MOFs as an efficient approach to manipulate their functionality provides excellent opportunities for the preparation of MOF&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). However, the use of this strategy to adjust the properties and develop the separation performance of gas separation membranes is still in its early stages. Here, a novel defect&#8208;engineered MOF (quasi ZrFum or Q&#8208;ZrFum) was synthesized via a controlled thermal deligandation process and incorporated into a CO2&#8208;philic 6FDA&#8208;durene polyimide (PI) matrix to form Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded MMMs. Defect&#8208;engineered MOFs and fabricated MMMs were investigated regarding their characteristic properties and separation performance. The incorporation of defects into the MOF structure increases the pore size and provides unsaturated active metal sites that positively affect CO2 molecule transport. The interfacial compatibility between the Q&#8208;ZrFum particles and the PI matrix increases via the deligandation process, which improves the mechanical strength of Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded membranes. MMM containing 5&#8197;wt.% of defect&#8208;engineered Q&#8208;ZrFum exhibits excellent CO2 permeability of 1308 Barrer, which increased by 99&#8201;% compared to the pure PI membrane (656 Barrer) at a feed pressure of 2&#8197;bar. CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity reached 44 and 26.6 which increased by about 70 and 16&#8201;%, respectively. This study emphasizes that defect&#8208;engineered MOFs can be promising candidates for use as fillers in the preparation of MMMs for the future development of membrane&#8208;based gas separation applications.

         <title>Interaction of C60 with Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Surfaces: Unveiling the Role of C60 in Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of C60 on MAPbI3 perovskite surfaces has been systematically explored by means of periodic density functional simulations. The charge transfer from the perovskite to the C60 to increases due to the presence of defects like Pb vacancies or I antisites, and C60 is able to promote the surface reconstruction.







Abstract
Understanding the interaction between fullerene (C60) and perovskite surfaces is pivotal for advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior of C60 on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations. We explore various surface terminations and defect configurations to elucidate the influence of surface morphology on the C60&#8208;perovskite interaction, computing the adsorption energy and transfer of charge. Our results reveal distinct adsorption energies and charge transfer mechanisms for different surface terminations, shedding light on the role of surface defects in modifying the electronic structure and stability of perovskite materials. Furthermore, we provide insights into the potential of C60 to passivate surface defects, playing a relevant role in the surface reconstruction after the formation of defects. This comprehensive understanding of C60&#8208;perovskite interactions offers valuable guidelines about the role of fullerenes on surface structure and reconstruction.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Alcohols to &#946;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Vinylsulfones by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric organocatalytic oxa&#8208;Michael reaction has been developed to synthesize chiral secondary alcohol derivatives with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Particularly noteworthy is the utilization of aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles in the asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael step, overcoming obstacles associated with their direct utilization as Michael donors. Furthermore, a sequential process offers a novel synthetic strategy for constructing essential fluorinated chiral alcohols from readily available materials.







Abstract
Chiral secondary alcohols, serving as essential structural motifs, hold significant potential for diverse applications. The exploration of effective synthetic strategies toward these compounds is both attractive and challenging. Herein, we present an asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael reaction involving aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles and &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl vinylsulfones catalyzed by bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS), achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Additionally, a sequential process including asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael and debenzylation, facilitated by BPS/Lewis acid cooperation, was revealed for synthesizing diverse chiral secondary alcohol compounds in high yields (81&#8211;88&#8201;%) with consistent stereoselectivities. Furthermore, mechanistic explorations and subsequent results unveiled that the enantioselectivity originates from hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair interactions between the BPS catalyst and the substrates.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stereoselective 1,5&#8208;addition and N&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition cascade reaction is developed for the convenient preparation of valuable polysubstituted dihydropyrroles in high yields and with excellent diastereoselectivity. An unprecedented enantioselective protocol is also disclosed to access enantioenriched dihydropyrroles.







Abstract
An unprecedented 1,5&#8208;addition/N&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition cascade reaction is established via palladium hydride catalysis. A variety of polysubstituted dihydropyrrole skeletons are constructed in high yield and with exclusively &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereoselectivity. An enantioselective protocol of this design is also developed to provide a novel access to enantioenriched dihydropyrroles.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Isochromanes by Oxidative Aminocatalysis and Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes is reported by combining enantioselective oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis. The presented isochromanes can be applied to scaffold derivatization and photoaffinity labelling of proteins.







Abstract
A novel strategy that combines oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis allows the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes, a motif that is prevalent in natural products and synthetic bioactive compounds. In the first step, &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes and propargylic alcohols are transformed into &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with excellent optical purities (&gt;90&#8201;% ee) via oxidative umpolung with DDQ and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. Subsequent gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation affords the isochromane products with retention of the quaternary stereocenter. A second approach explores the use of allylic alcohols as reaction partners for the oxidative coupling to furnish &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with generally lower enantiopurities. Stereoretentive cyclization to isochromane products is achieved via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation with allylic acetates as a reactive handle. A number of synthetic elaborations and a biological study on these &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes highlight the potential applicability of the presented method.

         <title>Effect of Br&#248;nsted Acids on the Activation of Mixed Anhydride/Mixed Carbonic Anhydride and C&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Methylated Peptide Synthesis in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison between amidations using mixed carbonic anhydride and mixed anhydride in the presence of tertiary amine and Br&#248;nsted acids revealed a significant difference in the anhydrides. A rapid micro&#8208;flow C&#8208;terminal&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis via acyl imidazolium without severe racemization has been developed. Unexpectedly, epimerization of the C&#8208;terminal&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated dipeptide was observed.







Abstract
Amidations employing mixed (carbonic) anhydrides have long been favoured in peptide synthesis because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness and less waste generation. Despite their long history, no study has compared the effects of additives on the activation of mixed anhydrides and carbonic anhydrides. In this study, we investigated the amidation of mixed (carbonic) anhydride in the presence of a base and/or Br&#248;nsted acids. The use of NMI&#8901;HCl significantly improved the conversion of the mixed carbonic anhydride, while expediting nucleophilic attacks on the desired carbonyl group. In contrast, in the case of mixed anhydrides, neither the conversion nor the desired nucleophilic attack improved significantly. We developed a C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis method using mixed carbonic anhydrides in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. Fourteen N&#8208;alkylated peptides were synthesized in moderate to high yields (55&#8211;99&#8201;%) without severe racemization (&lt;1&#8201;%). Additionally, a significant enhancement in the amidation between mixed carbonic anhydrides and bis&#8208;TMS&#8208;protected N&#8208;methyl amino acids with the inclusion of NMI&#8901;HCl was observed for the first time. In addition, we observed unexpected C&#8208;terminal epimerization of the C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methyl peptides.

         <dc:description>
A combination of silver oxide (Ag2O) catalyst, potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) and SelectfluorTM was identified to perform radical carbofluorination reactions of olefin and &#945;&#8208;fluoroolefin substrates with carbamoyl radicals generated in&#8197;situ from sodium oxamate salts. Both transformations proceed under mild conditions and provide respectively a straightforward access to &#946;&#8208;fluoroamides and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoroamides.







Abstract
The reactivity of carbamoyl radicals, generated in&#8197;situ from sodium oxamate salts, has been investigated in the context of radical carbofluorination reactions of olefins and &#945;&#8208;fluoroolefins, respectively.

The reported methods provide a direct access to &#946;&#8208;fluoroamides and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoroamides.

         <title>Telescoped Flow Synthesis of Azacyclic Scaffolds Exploiting the Chromoselective Photolysis of Vinyl Azides and Azirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;This study reports an efficient and readily scalable photochemical route into azirines and related photo&#8208;dimers that can be accessed from simple vinyl azides in a chromoselective manner. The value of these entities is demonstrated through flow&#8208;based conversions to highly substituted dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines that are privileged scaffolds in medicinal and materials chemistry.&#8221;







Abstract
An efficient chromoselective photochemical process is presented for the synthesis of 2H&#8208;azirines and 1,3&#8208;diazabicylo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;3&#8208;enes from readily available vinyl azides. The method exploits continuous flow photochemistry to enable the safe consumption of the hazardous azide group and provides uniform irradiation using high&#8208;power LEDs at 365&#8211;450&#8197;nm. Additionally, a scaled telescoped process has been developed providing access to drug&#8208;like 1,6&#8208;dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines via integrated ring&#8208;expansion and oxidation reactions. Given the prevalence of various azacyclic targets in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials applications it is anticipated that this methodology will enable further exploitations of these important scaffolds.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This study reports an efficient and readily scalable photochemical route into azirines and related photo-dimers that can be accessed from simple vinyl azides in a chromoselective manner. The value of these entities is demonstrated through flow-based conversions to highly substituted dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines that are privileged scaffolds in medicinal and materials chemistry.&#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient chromoselective photochemical process is presented for the synthesis of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirines and 1,3-diazabicylo[3.1.0]hex-3-enes from readily available vinyl azides. The method exploits continuous flow photochemistry to enable the safe consumption of the hazardous azide group and provides uniform irradiation using high-power LEDs at 365&#8211;450&#8197;nm. Additionally, a scaled telescoped process has been developed providing access to drug-like 1,6-dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; integrated ring-expansion and oxidation reactions. Given the prevalence of various azacyclic targets in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials applications it is anticipated that this methodology will enable further exploitations of these important scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocompatible Synthesis of Macrocyclic Thiazol(in)e Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a biocompatible method to synthesize macrocyclic peptides with thiazoline heterocycles. Learn how a cleavable linker enables direct installation of a reactive nitrile group at the peptide C&#8208;terminus during solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Explore the transformation of the peptide's thiazoline into thiazole or cysteine through oxidation or hydrolysis, unlocking the potential of three classes of macrocyclic peptides in one synthesis.







Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides containing a thiazole or thiazoline in the backbone are considered privileged structures in both natural compounds and drug discovery, owing to their enhanced bioactivity, stability, and permeability. Here, we present the biocompatible synthesis of macrocyclic peptides from N&#8208;terminal cysteine and C&#8208;terminal nitrile. While the N&#8208;terminal cysteine is incorporated during solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, the C&#8208;terminal nitrile is introduced during cleavage with aminoacetonitrile, utilizing a cleavable benzotriazole linker. This method directly yields the fully functionalized linear peptide precursor. The biocompatible cyclization reaction occurs in buffer at physiological pH and room temperature. The resulting thiazoline heterocycle remains stable in buffer but hydrolyzes under acidic conditions. While such hydrolysis enables access to macrocyclic peptides with a complete amide backbone, mild oxidation of the thiazoline leads to the stable thiazole macrocyclic peptide. While conventional oxidation strategies involve metals, we developed a protocol simply relying on alkaline salt and air. Therefore, we offer a rapid and metal&#8208;free pathway to macrocyclic thiazole peptides, featuring a biocompatible key cyclization step.

         <title>Front Cover: Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids (Chem. Eur. J. 38/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new atomistic model called MechaPredict uses DFT to predict the Young's modulus of crystal surfaces to within numerical accuracy. Within a computer, a crystal surface experiences mechanical stress leading to an accurate estimate of the surface mechanical properties. Crucially, unlike the existing experimental nanoindentation technique, which must be done serially on one crystal facet at a time, MechaPredict can perform multiple computations for multiple crystals and their facets. In the cover image, only one CPU core is being used, leaving the impression that the unused CPU cores can be used to perform additional high&#8208;throughput computations of dozens of crystal surfaces, saving time, effort and money in the quest for the discovery of new mechanically responsive molecular crystals. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;C. Sun, S. Mohamed and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400779).

         <title>Cover Feature: Post&#8208;Formation of Fused Pentagonal Structure on Fjord Region of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons under Hydrothermal Conditions (Chem. Eur. J. 38/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>

Platinum catalyzes the cleavage of two C&#8722;H bonds at the fjord position of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and the subsequent C&#8722;C bond formation gives a cyclopenta&#8208;PAH. This post&#8208;construction of the pentagonal structure is energetically challenging and requires high temperatures. With water as the medium, it has been found that the monocyclization selectively occurs at a lower temperature. Fe2O3 is effective in suppressing side reactions. We found this reactivity in the Pt&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene in D2O. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsuji and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400987).

The Cover Feature presents Li@calix[3]pyrrole, the newest member of the molecular electride family, realizing its unique electronic structure. Theoretical investigations reveal the position of its anionic electron localized outside the molecular structure, adjacent to the pyrrole N&#8722;H moieties. This special charge&#8208;separated configuration is facilitated by an electron transfer from lithium to a molecular orbital located at the back of the calix[3]pyrrole fragment.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Molecular Processes in DNA: A Perspective on Gas&#8208;Phase Interaction Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective explores the technical developments towards crossed&#8208;beam studies of ionizing radiation with mass&#8208;selected and conformationally pure beams of oligonucleotide ions. It reviews key developments in the field and highlights challenges. The relevance of expected future results as benchmarks for quantum chemical calculations and for multiscale&#8208;modelling of radiation therapy is outlined.







Abstract
Studying the direct effects of DNA irradiation is essential for understanding the impact of radiation on biological systems. Gas&#8208;phase interactions are especially well suited to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying these direct effects. Only relatively recently, isolated DNA oligonucleotides were irradiated by ionizing particles such as VUV or X&#8208;ray photons or ion beams, and ionic products were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This article provides a comprehensive review of primarily experimental investigations in this field over the past decade, emphasizing the description of processes such as ionization, fragmentation, charge and hydrogen transfer triggered by photoabsorption or ion collision, and the recent progress made thanks to specific atomic photoabsorption. Then, we outline ongoing experimental developments notably involving ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, crossed beams or time&#8208;resolved measurements. The discussion extends to potential research directions for the future.

         <title>The Complete Assessment of Small Molecule and Peptidomimetic Inhibitors of Sortase A Towards Antivirulence Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 38, July 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA), where it is considered as a major target for antivirulence therapy. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells and are considered major virulence factors. Currently, many promising approaches to target SrtA are available, including naturally derived and synthetic small molecule inhibitors as well as peptidomimetic inhibitors, based on the SrtA recognition sequence.







Abstract
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA). Sortase A (SrtA) is a critical virulence factor, present ubiquitously in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria of which many are pathogenic. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells, by anchoring extracellular matrix&#8208;binding proteins to the bacterial outer cell wall. By targeting virulence factors, effective treatment can be achieved, without inducing antibiotic resistance to the treatment. This is a potentially more sustainable, long&#8208;term approach to treating bacterial infections, including ones that display multiple resistance to current therapeutics. There are many promising approaches available for SrtA inhibition, some of which have the potential to advance into further clinical development, with peptidomimetic and in&#8197;vivo active small molecules being among the most promising. There are currently no approved drugs on the market targeting SrtA, despite its promise, adding to the relevance of this review article, as it extends to the pharmaceutical industry additionally to academic researchers.

         <dc:description>Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) has evolved as a new scientific discipline around the boundary of highly active fields: electrochemistry and photocatalysis. EPC allows us to combine the energy of light and electric potential to activate previously inaccessible compounds via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Herein, we review the most essential applications of EPC to the C&#8208;H functionalization of molecules. This work discusses mechanisms that can be encountered when designing such processes and analyzes technical aspects of performing EPC reactions in the laboratory.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimers and 2D Networks of Adamantane&#8208;Related Ternary Organosilicon Coinage Metal Sulfide Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adamantane&#8208;type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal&#8208;phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon&#8208;based congener [(PhSi)4S6]&#160;(A) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et3PAg)3(PhSi)3S6] (B) and [Na2(thf)2.33][(Me3PCu)(PhSi)3S6] (C). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe2Ph)3] (1) and [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 (2), the study addresses reactions of A with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2, upon which A is completely disassembled to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#181;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph] (3). In another case a CH2 group, most likely stemming from CH2Cl2, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH2P(Ph2)CH2CH2}2] (4). Upon using CuCl and 1,4&#8209;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine&#8208;bridged analog of B, [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2] (5). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of C, we used PMe2Ph as a bulkier ligand. This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6] (6). UV&#8208;visible spectra of 6 indicated a bandgap of 3.89 eV, thus blue&#8208;shifted in regards to B and C.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition for Encapsulation of a Stilbazolium&#8208;Type Dye with Enhanced Photophysical Properties and Nonlinear Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing organic composite materials through molecular recognition has emerged as an important theme in materials science. Here we report an ion&#8208;pair recognition system involving the use of a propoxylated pillar[5]arene (PrP5) to modulate the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of dye trans&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;stilbazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMASP). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the dye guest DMASP is encapsulated by PrP5 to form a 2:1 host&#8722;guest complex 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP in the crystalline state. The macrocyclic skeleton of PrP5 imposes restrictions on the intramolecular motions of the dye guest, leading to a significant enhancement of its fluorescence emission. Additionally, within the 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP complex crystal structure, DMASP molecules are found to display two possible opposite orientations in the one&#8208;dimensional channels formed by PrP5 molecules. This arrangement is believed to alter the overall solid&#8208;state packing structure of DMASP, thereby activating its nonlinear optical activity. This work not only reports a novel ion&#8208;pair molecular recognition system based on pillararenes but also provides valuable insights into the modulation of the crystalline state photophysical properties of organic dyes via cocrystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Access to Potent Anticancer Tubulysins and Linker&#8208;Functionalized Payloads Via an All&#8208;On&#8208;Resin Strategy</title>

Tubulysin analogs can now be functionalized with the p&#8208;aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium linker and a cleavable peptide on solid phase, with a higher efficiency and better safety than in previous solution&#8208;phase protocols. This all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy also allows the diversification at the internal amide N&#8208;substituent, producing first&#8208;in&#8208;class analogs functionalized with lipids, linkers, and conjugation handles.Improved access to potent anticancer tubulysins and linker&#8208;functionalized payloads via an all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy (Daniel G.

Abstract
Tubulysins are among the most recent antimitotic compounds to enter into antibody/peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC/PDC) development. Thus far, the design of the most promising tubulysin payloads relied on simplifying their structures, e.&#8201;g., by using small tertiary amide N&#8208;substituents (Me, Et, Pr) on the tubuvaline residue. Cumbersome solution&#8208;phase approaches are typically used for both syntheses and functionalization with cleavable linkers. p&#8208;Aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium (PABQ) linkers were a remarkable advancement for targeted delivery, but the procedures to incorporate them into tubulysins are only of moderate efficiency. Here we describe a novel all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy permitting a loss&#8208;free resin linkage and an improved access to super potent tubulysin analogs showing close resemblance to the natural compounds. For the first time, a protocol enables the integration of on&#8208;resin tubulysin derivatization with, e.&#8201;g., a maleimido&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PABQ linker, which is a notable progress for the payload&#8208;PABQ&#8208;linker technology. The strategy also allows tubulysin diversification of the internal amide N&#8208;substituent, thus enabling to screen a tubulysin library for the discovery of new potent analogs. This work provides ADC/PDC developers with new tools for both rapid access to new derivatives and easier linker&#8208;attachment and functionalization.

         <title>Antiaromaticity of Cycloheptatrienyl Anions: Structure, Acidity, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloheptatrienyl anions are studied in terms of their acidity, structure, and antiaromatic properties. The substituents directly affect the acidity of the anion, while the magnetic properties originate from the geometry of the anion, which in turn is determined by the conjugation and steric properties of the substituents.







Abstract
Investigations of the nature and degree of antiaromaticity of cycloheptatrienyl anion derivatives using both experimental and computational tools are presented. The ground state of cycloheptatrienyl anion in the gas phase is triplet, planar and Baird&#8208;aromatic. In DMSO, it assumes a singlet distorted allylic form with a paratropic ring current. The other derivatives in both phases assume either allylic or diallylic conformations depending on the substituent pattern. A combination of experimental and computational methods was used to determine the pKa values of 16 derivatives in DMSO, which ranged from 36 to &#8722;10.7. We revealed that the stronger stabilization of the anionic system, which correlates with acidity, does not necessarily imply a lower degree of antiaromaticity in terms of magnetic properties. Conversely, the substitution pattern first affects the geometry of the ring through the bulkiness of the substituents and their better conjugation with a more distorted system. Consequently, the distortion reduces the cyclic conjugation in the &#960;&#8208;system and thereby decreases the paratropic current in a magnetic field, which manifests itself as a decrease in the NICS. The triplet&#8208;state geometries and magnetic properties are nearly independent on the substitution pattern, which is typical for simple aromatic systems.

         <title>m6A Methylation of Transcription Leader Sequence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Impacts Discontinuous Transcription of Subgenomic mRNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Host&#8208;mediated regulation: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA at position A74 is methylated to m6A by the host METTL3/METTL14 complex. We show that this modification destabilizes the structure of stemloop 3 in the 5&#8217; untranslated region. This modification of a transcription regulatory sequence has a significant effect on the stability of the duplexes that are formed during viral RNA synthesis, and regulate abundance of the subgenomic RNAs.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome has been shown to be m6A methylated at several positions in&#8197;vivo. Strikingly, a DRACH motif, the recognition motif for adenosine methylation, resides in the core of the transcriptional regulatory leader sequence (TRS&#8722;L) at position A74, which is highly conserved and essential for viral discontinuous transcription. Methylation at position A74 correlates with viral pathogenicity. Discontinuous transcription produces a set of subgenomic mRNAs that function as templates for translation of all structural and accessory proteins. A74 is base&#8208;paired in the short stem&#8208;loop structure 5&#8217;SL3 that opens during discontinuous transcription to form long&#8208;range RNA&#8208;RNA interactions with nascent (&#8722;)&#8208;strand transcripts at complementary TRS&#8208;body sequences. A74 can be methylated by the human METTL3/METTL14 complex in&#8197;vitro. Here, we investigate its impact on the structural stability of 5&#8217;SL3 and the long&#8208;range TRS&#8208;leader:TRS&#8208;body duplex formation necessary for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs of all four viral structural proteins. Methylation uniformly destabilizes 5&#8217;SL3 and long&#8208;range duplexes and alters their relative equilibrium populations, suggesting that the m6A74 modification acts as a regulator for the abundance of viral structural proteins due to this destabilization.

         <title>Rapid Access to Divergent Fused Polycycles via One&#8208;Pot A3 Coupling and Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise method has been developed for the synthesis of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing linear and angularly fused polycyclic systems from simple and readily available materials. It involves one&#8208;pot reaction of the alkyne aldehyde&#8211;alkyne&#8211;amine (A3) coupling in tandem with intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder and one&#8208;step derivation of the product thereof. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z. Guo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401449).

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Switching in Azine&#8208;Containing Fluorophores Displaying Resonance&#8208;Stabilized ESIPT Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports the synthesis, along with structural and photophysical characterization of 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives functionalized with various azaheterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine, terpyridine). These compounds show dual&#8208;state emission properties, that is intense fluorescence both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state with a range of fluorescent color going from blue to orange. Moreover, the nature of their excited state can be tuned by the presence of external stimuli such as protons or metal cations. In the absence of stimuli, these dyes show emission stemming from anionic species obtained after deprotonation (D* transition), whereas upon protonation or metal chelation, ESIPT process occurs leading to a stabilized and highly emissive K* transition. With the help of extensive ab initio calculations, we confirm that external stimuli can switch the nature of the transitions, making this series of dyes attractive candidates for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent ratiometric probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Complexes with Appended Benzimidazole Groups for Sensing Dihydrogenphosphate</title>

         <title>Biocatalysis in Non&#8208;Conventional Media: Unlocking the Potential for Sustainable Chiral Amine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of biocatalysis has become essential in both academic and industrial domains for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, and it serves as an alternative tool to transition&#8208;metal catalysis and complements traditional chemical methods. It relies on the swift expansion of available processes, primarily as a result of advanced tools for enzyme discovery, combined with high&#8208;throughput laboratory evolution techniques for optimising biocatalysts. This manuscript highlights recent chemical and technological developments contributing to the sustainable applications of biocatalysis with industrial interest. Specifically, the use of non&#8208;conventional reaction media and the combination with photocatalysis can enhance production of chiral amines by allowing higher working concentrations and cascade transformations, leading to high yields and enantiomeric excesses. Furthermore, a selection of both known and modern strategies for enzyme immobilisation, along with the use of fed&#8208;batch and flow synthesis, demonstrates the potential to translate laboratory synthesis to effective scaled&#8208;up applications and improve the processing of large reaction volumes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative N&#8211;N Bond Formation Versus the Curtius Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative formation of N&#8211;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and coauthors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8211;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis and Recovery of Single Crystals of the Metastable Manganese Carbide, MnCx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal carbides are used widely throughout industry for their high hardness, superior resistance to corrosion, and stability under extremes of temperature and radiation. Here we describe the discovery of a novel sub&#8208;stoichiometric anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type compound, MnCx (P63/mmc), synthesized at pressures between ~5&#8211;10&#8197;GPa and recovered fully to ambient conditions as single crystals.







Abstract
Transition metal carbides find widespread use throughout industry due to their high strength and resilience under extreme conditions. However, they remain largely limited to compounds formed from the early d&#8208;block elements, since the mid&#8208;to&#8208;late transition metals do not form thermodynamically stable carbides. We report here the high&#8208;pressure bulk synthesis of large single crystals of a novel metastable manganese carbide compound, MnCx (P63/mmc), which adopts the anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type structure with significant substoichiometry at the carbon sites. We demonstrate how synthesis pressure modulates the carbon loading, with ~40&#8201;% occupancy being achieved at 9.9&#8197;GPa.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Allylic Sulfone Derivatives via Sequential Hydroalkoxylation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the formation of structurally complex &#948;,&#948;&#8208;dimethoxy allyl sulfone derivatives, highlighting the direct nucleophilic attack of methoxide on sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes. The magical box metaphorically serves as the focal point, from which a large treasure of diverse and structurally intricate allylic sulfone derivatives bursts forth. The vibrant hue in the background emanating from the box symbolises the energy and excitement of newly synthesized compounds. The use of blue crystals interspersed among the compounds adds an element of elegance and refinement, suggesting the high value of these allylic sulfone derivatives. Surrounding the main stream of light are various allylic sulfone derivatives, adorned with different functional groups, indicating the versatility and potential for customization in their synthesis.

     alt="Synthesis of Diverse Allylic Sulfone Derivatives via Sequential Hydroalkoxylation of 1,3-Enynes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows the formation of structurally complex &#948;,&#948;-dimethoxy allyl sulfone derivatives, highlighting the direct nucleophilic attack of methoxide on sulfone-containing 1,3-enynes. The magical box metaphorically serves as the focal point, from which a large treasure of diverse and structurally intricate allylic sulfone derivatives bursts forth. The vibrant hue in the background emanating from the box symbolises the energy and excitement of newly synthesized compounds. The use of blue crystals interspersed among the compounds adds an element of elegance and refinement, suggesting the high value of these allylic sulfone derivatives. Surrounding the main stream of light are various allylic sulfone derivatives, adorned with different functional groups, indicating the versatility and potential for customization in their synthesis.

         <title>Discovering of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters by High&#8208;Throughput Syntheses Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a high&#8208;throughput metal nanocluster synthesis method assisted by machine learning, which can accelerate the discovery of nanoclusters, improve the synthesis efficiency, and successfully form a series of nanoclusters (i.&#8201;e., Au41Cu66, Au40Cu34, Au18Cu32, Au18, Au6Cu6, Cu&#8722;NC nanoclusters). This study further reinforces the importance of high&#8208;throughput screening in advancing the field of nanocluster research.







Abstract
Understanding the complete structure of noble metal nanoclusters is both academically and practically significant. However, progress has been hindered by the low synthetic efficiency of many nanocluster syntheses. In this study, we present the first high&#8208;throughput syntheses of homo&#8208;gold, homo&#8208;copper, and gold&#8208;copper alloy nanoclusters in dichloromethane at room temperature. Through high&#8208;throughput screening, we successfully obtained three nanoclusters in a single reaction: Au18(SC6H11)14, [Au41Cu66(SC6H11)44](SbF6)3, and an unidentified copper cluster (referred to as Au18, Au41Cu66, and Cu&#8722;NC). The optimized synthesis route was achieved with the assistance of machine learning for experimental data analysis, which also guided the synthesis of other metal nanoclusters such as Au40Cu34(4&#8208;S&#8208;PhF)40 (Au40Cu34), [Au6Cu6(SPh)12]n ([Au6Cu6]n), and Au18Cu32(3,5&#8208;C8H9S)36 (Au18Cu32)). This research demonstrates that high&#8208;throughput screening can be a valuable tool in accelerating the development of nanocluster syntheses.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrene is a well&#8208;known excellent organic luminescent molecule, but it suffers from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;induced aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in the solid state. In our study, the encapsulation of a crown ether can significantly enhance the fluorescence of the pyrene in the solid state, resulting in a transformation from ACQ to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Moreover, we also found that the original impure emission of the pyrene could be purified to a single emission. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Li and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400741).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic vinylic substitution (SNV) by carbon nucleophiles allows the formation of vinylic C&#8211;C bonds without transition metal catalysts. In this paper, we show that tethering two alkenes together through a urea linkage can lead to the formation of a diene by an intramolecular SNV reaction. The starting materials are fully substituted&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;diallyl ureas; the reaction proceeds in the presence of base, and entails a cascade of deprotonations, reprotonations, and an SNV reaction of an allylic carbanion on a rare electrophile: a vinylic urea. As a result, two allylic substituents couple to form a diene, despite the fact that neither is activated towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is tolerant of significant steric bulk, and exhibits regioselectivity with unsymmetrical diallyl ureas:&#160;&#946;&#8208;substituted allyl groups invariably behave as nucleophiles, while electrophilic behavior may be enforced by the use of an&#160;E&#8208;vinylic urea substituent that cannot be deprotonated under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence of Aggregated Aromatic Peptides for Studying the Kinetics of Aggregation and Hardening of Amyloid&#8208;like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capability of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibers to emit intrinsic&#8208;fluorescence enables the study of their formation, stability and hardening through time&#8208;resolved fluorescence analysis, without the need for additional intercalating dyes. This approach allows the monitoring of amyloid&#8208;like peptides aggregation kinetics using minimal sample volumes, and the simultaneous testing of numerous experimental conditions and analytes, offering rapid and reproducible results. The analytical procedure applied to the aromatic hexapeptide F6, alone or derivatized with PEG (polyethylene glycol) moiety of different lengths, suggests that aggregation into large anisotropic structures negatively correlates with initial monomer concentration and relies on the presence of charged N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini. PEGylation reduces the extent of aggregates hardening, possibly by retaining water, and overall impacts the final structural properties of the aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting Manganese Amidinate and &#223;&#8208;Ketoiminate Complexes as Precursors for Mn&#8208;Based Thin Film Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring new manganese complexes bearing all nitrogen coordinated and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated ligand systems revealed very interesting insights on the structure&#8208;property relationship. A comprehensive investigation on the physico&#8208;chemical properties alongside DFT experiments has identified potential precursors for chemical vapor deposition processing of Mn containing thin films.

With a focus on Mn based organometallic compounds with suitable physico&#8208;chemical properties to serve as precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Mn&#8208;containing materials, systematic synthetic approaches with ligand variation, detailed characterization, and theoretical input from density functional theory (DFT) studies are presented. A series of new homoleptic all&#8208;nitrogen and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn(II) complexes bearing the acetamidinate, formamidinate, guanidinate and &#223;&#8208;ketoiminate ligands have been successfully synthesized for the first time. The specific choice of these ligand classes with changes in structure and coordination sphere and side chain variations result in significant structural differences whereby mononuclear and dinuclear complexes are formed. This was supported by density functional theory (DFT) studies. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. To evaluate their suitability as precursors for deposition of Mn&#8208;based materials, the thermal properties were investigated in detail. Mn(II) complexes possessing the most promising thermal properties, namely Bis(N,N&#8217;&#8208;ditertbutylformamidinato)manganese(II) (IV) and Bis(4&#8208;(isopropylamino)pent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;onato)manganese(II) (&#223;III) were used in reactivity studies with DFT to explore their interaction with oxidizing co&#8208;reactants such as oxygen and water which will guide future CVD and ALD process development.

         <title>Dual Basicity and Nucleophilicity of Organosodium Reagents in Benzylic C&#8722;H Additions of Toluenes to Diarylethenes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting on the dual basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium reagents, a new method for the benzylic C&#8722;H addition of toluenes to diarylethenes and ketones is described. Through careful reaction monitoring and trapping of key reaction intermediates, valuable mechanistic insights have been gained, together with a deeper understanding of the coordination preferences of sodium in these organometallic systems







Abstract
Profiting from the dual high basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium complexes, here we report the stepwise lateral metalation of a wide range of alkyl arenes (MeAr), mediated by hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble NaCH2SiMe3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PMDETA (PMDETA=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), followed by nucleophilic addition to diarylethenes of the newly generated NaCH2Ar&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PMDETA complexes. This method grants access to a range of functionalised hydrocarbons in excellent yields and can be upgraded to catalytic regimes when using trans&#8208;stilbene, a 10&#8197;mol% of the alkyl sodium base and toluene as a solvent. Extending this approach to aromatic ketones leads to the formation of stilbenes under mild reaction conditions, resulting from the deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones. Combining spectroscopic studies with the trapping and characterisation of key reaction intermediates, mechanistic insights have been gained, advancing the understanding of coordination effects in organosodium chemistry, and shedding light on their special reactivity profiles.

         <title>Molecular Hosts for the Sensing and Separation of 99TcO4&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective recognition and separation of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and environmental remediation efforts. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This Concept article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation from aqueous solutions using molecular hosts.







Abstract
In recent years, European Union member states have hastened energy policy deliberations to address supply and sustainability concerns, placing a significant emphasis on nuclear energy as a means to achieve decarbonization goals. However, despite its significant role in power generation, nuclear energy faces significant challenges linked to fuel reprocessing and waste disposal, that hinder its broader expansion. In this context, the separation of technetium represents a concerning issue. Indeed, technetium&#8216;s catalytic activity can impede the extraction of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium, affecting waste reprocessing efficiency. Additionally, the stable form of technetium in aerobic conditions, pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;), poses risks of groundwater contamination due to its mobility and solubility. Hence, sensing and separation of TcO4&#8722; is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and minimising radioactive contamination in the environment. However, the binding of TcO4&#8722; and its separation from contaminated solutions present challenges due to the acidic (or basic) waste components and the high ionic strength in real matrices. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation (using extraction and sorption) with a focus on molecular hosts. Metal&#8208;organic receptors will also be discussed.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Stacking Approach Enabling Interconversion between Bis(xanthylium) and its Reduced Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the newly designed cyclophane&#8208;type dications, the xanthylium units facing each other exert attractive rather than repulsive effects, even though there is electrostatic repulsion between cation units. Due to an intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, not only the dications but also their reduced species can be stabilized. Thus, stepwise redox interconversion was achieved via radical cation species.







Abstract
Cyclophane&#8208;type dications with two units of xanthylium were designed, with the expectation that intramolecular interaction between cation units could induce changes in absorption and redox behavior. The desired dications were synthesized via the macrocyclic diketone as a key intermediate, which was efficiently obtained by a stepwise etherification. X&#8208;ray and UV/Vis measurements revealed that the cyclophane&#8208;type dications adopt a stacking structure in both the crystal and solution. Due to the intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of the xanthylium units, a considerable blue shift compared to the corresponding monocations and a two&#8208;stage one&#8208;electron reduction process were observed in the dications. Furthermore, upon electrochemical reduction of dications, the formation of biradicals via radical cation species was demonstrated by UV/Vis spectroscopy with several isosbestic points at both stages. Therefore, the cation&#8208;stacking approach is a promising way to provide novel properties due to perturbation of their molecular orbitals and to stabilize the reduced species even though they have open&#8208;shell characters.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Decarboxylation of Proline&#8208;Derived Building Blocks for Protein&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved protocol for the C&#8208;terminal decarboxylation of peptidic compounds opens an efficient access to new amino acid&#8208;derived building blocks with potentially improved drug&#8208;like properties. The method was applied in the late&#8208;stage decarboxylation of a polycyclic diproline mimetic and in the synthesis of a first decarboxy&#8208;inhibitor of the EVH1domain.







Abstract
Using a set of conformationally restricted Proline&#8208;derived Modules (ProMs), our group has recently succeeded in developing inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator&#8208;stimulated phosphoprotein homology&#8197;1 (EVH1) domain, which is a key mediator of cell migration and plays an important role in tumor metastasis. While these (formally) pentapeptidic compounds show nanomolecular binding affinities towards EVH1, their drug&#8208;like properties and cell permeability need to be further optimized before they can be clinically tested as therapeutic agents against metastasis. In this study, we sought to improve these properties by removing the C&#8208;terminal carboxylic acid function of our peptoids, either by late&#8208;stage decarboxylation or by direct synthesis. For late&#8208;stage decarboxylation of ProM&#8208;like systems, a method for reductive halo decarboxylation was optimized and applied to several proline&#8208;derived substrates. In this way, a series of new decarboxy ProMs suitable as building blocks for decarboxy EVH1 inhibitors were obtained. In addition, we incorporated decarboxy&#8208;ProM&#8208;1 into the pentapeptide&#8208;like compound Ac[2ClF][ProM&#8208;2][Decarb&#8208;ProM&#8208;1], which showed similar affinity towards EVH1 as the methyl ester derivative (Ac[2Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][ProM1]OMe). However, despite better calculated drug&#8208;like properties, this compound did not inhibit chemotaxis in a cellular assay.

         <title>Uncovering Factors Controlling Reactivity of Metal&#8208;TEMPO Reaction Systems in the Solid State and Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of Et(Cl)Zn with TEMPO is explored as a novel platform for systematic studies on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on the O&#8208; vs N&#8208;radical scavenger TEMPO mode. The reported in&#8208;depth experimental and theoretical studies revealed how the electronic, conformational and steric effects act synergistically in turning the coordinated TEMPO molecule from the O&#8208; to N&#8208;radical scavenger.







Abstract
Nitroxides find application in various areas of chemistry, and a more in&#8208;depth understanding of factors controlling their reactivity with metal complexes is warranted to promote further developments. Here, we report on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on both the distribution of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;centered spin density in 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) and turning TEMPO from the O&#8208; to N&#8208;radical mode scavenger in metal&#8208;TEMPO systems. We use Et(Cl)Zn/TEMPO model reaction system with tuneable reactivity in the solid state and solution. Among various products, a unique Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct of Cl2Zn with the N&#8208;ethylated TEMPO was isolated and structurally characterised, and the so&#8208;called solid&#8208;state &#8242;slow chemistry&#8242; reaction led to a higher yield of the N&#8208;alkylated product. The revealed structure&#8208;activity/selectivity correlations are exceptional yet are entirely rationalised by the mechanistic underpinning supported by theoretical calculations of studied model systems. This work lays a foundation and mechanistic blueprint for future metal/nitroxide systems exploration.

         <title>Mechanochemical synthesis of corannulene flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors and preparation of their metal complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes reveal ball&#8208;milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent&#8208;based methods. In addition, we have demonstrated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the herein reported corannulene flanked NHCs to be robust ligands to transition metals and their ligand substitution reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CoCorrole&#8208;Functionalized PCN&#8208;222 for Carbon Monoxide Selective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high risk of CO poisoning justifies the need for indoor air quality control and warning systems based on the detection of low concentrations (ppm&#8208;ppb) of CO. Cobalt corrole complexes selectively bind CO vs. O2, CO2, N2, opening new fields of applications. By combining the CO chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the known sorption capacity of MOFs, we hope to obtain high performance sensing materials for CO detection. In addition, the exposed metal sites of MOFs lead to CO2 physisorption, allowing the co&#8208;detection of CO and CO2. In this work, PCN&#8208;222 a stable Zr&#8208;based MOF made from Ni(TCPP) with natural vacancies has been used as a porous matrix for the grafting of electron&#8208;poor metallocorroles. The materials were characterized by powder XRD, SEM and optical microscopy, BET analyses and gas adsorption measurements at 298 K. No degradation of the crystalline structure of PCN&#8208;222 was observed. At 1 atm, the adsorbed CO(g) volumes measured for the best materials were 12.15 cm3 g&#8208;1 and 14.01 cm3 g&#8208;1 for CoCorr2@PCN&#8208;222 and CoCorr3@PCN&#8208;222 respectively, and both materials exhibited high CO chemisorption and selectivity against O2, N2, and CO2 at low pressure due to the highest energy of the chemisorption process vs physisorption.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Vitamin D3&#160;Enhanced by Long&#8208;Range Effects of a&#160;Substrate Channel Mutation in Cytochrome P450BM3&#160;(CYP102A1)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitamin D deficiency affects nearly half the population, with many requiring or opting for supplements with vitamin D3(VD3), the precursor of vitamin D (1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyVD3). 25&#8208;HydroxyVD3, the circulating form of vitamin D, is a more effective supplement than VD3&#160;but its synthesis is complex. We report here the engineering of cytochrome P450BM3(CYP102A1) for the selective oxidation of VD3&#160;to 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3. Long&#8208;range&#160;effects of the substrate&#8208;channel mutation Glu435Ile promoted binding of the VD3&#160;side chain close to the heme, enhancing VD3&#160;oxidation activity that reached 6.62 g of 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3&#160;isolated from a 1&#8208;litre scale reaction (69.1% yield; space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 331 mg/L/h).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers have attracted a great deal of attention lately due to their numerous applications in organic synthesis and to their employment in drug discovery. However, the synthetic arsenal at our disposal with which to access them remains limited. The research described herein is two&#8208;pronged; we both demonstrate the use of MCR chemistry as a synthetic strategy for the de novo synthesis of a class of atropisomers having high barriers to rotation with the simultaneous insertion of multiple chiral elements and we study these unprecedented molecular systems by employing a combination of crystallography, NMR and DFT calculations. By fully exploiting the synthetic capabilities of our chemistry, we have been able to monitor a range of different types of interaction, i.e. &#960;&#8208;&#960;, CH&#8208;&#960;, heteroatom&#8208;&#960; and CD&#8208;&#960;, in order to conduct structure&#8208;property studies. The results could be applied both to atroposelective synthesis and in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Effect and Intrinsic Electrophilicity and Nucleophilicity from a Conceptual Density Functional Theory and Information&#8208;Theoretic Approach as Quantitative Probes of Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Appreciating reactivity in terms of physicochemical effects for chemical processes&#160;is one of the most important undertakings in chemistry. While transition state (TS) theory provides the framework enabling the reliable calculation of the barrier height for a given elementary step, analytical tools are necessary to gain insight into key factors governing the different processes during chemical reactions. In this contribution, we partition the potential energy surface of an elementary step along the intrinsic coordinate into three segments, the so&#8208;called Pre&#8208;TS, TS, and Post&#8208;TS regions, and then determine the most important factors dictating each segment. This analysis is based on the use of both reactivity descriptors from conceptual density functional theory and concepts from the information&#8208;theoretic approach in density functional theory. We found that in both Pre&#8208;TS and Post&#8208;TS regions, steric effects are the dominant factors, whereas in the TS region, it is the intrinsic electrophilic and nucleophilic propensity of the transition state structure that governs the reactivity. The wide applicability of our approach is shown by a validation for a total of 37 organic and inorganic reactions. This work thus, in our view, provides a novel perspective on how chemical reactivity can be quantified at different stages of chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life&#8217;s existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge&#8212;especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA&#8217;s hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene Appended Benzothiadiazoles as Chiral Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive covalently linked benzothiadiazole 4,7&#8208;bis(helicenes), with the [6]helicene representatives showing CPL activity in solution and in the solid state, have been obtained through a straightforward strategy.







Abstract
A homologous series of 4,7&#8208;bis(aryl) substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) compounds, containing the helicenic derivatives bis([4]helicene), bis([5]helicene) and bis([6]helicene), have been prepared upon a double Suzuki coupling between 3,6&#8208;bis(pinacolyl&#8208;borane)&#8208;BTD and the corresponding bromo&#8208;aryl precursors. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the bis([4]helicene) compound shows the existence of both helicities (M) and (P) on the same molecule. All the compounds of the series are highly emissive in solution, with quantum yields of the emission ranging from 50 to 91&#8201;%. The enantiopure compounds (M,M) and (P,P) for the BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene) have been prepared from the corresponding enantiopure 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;[6]helicene precursors. Their chiroptical properties have been investigated in correlation with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which allowed to confidently assign the absolute configuration of the helicene arms and to characterize the different electronic transitions, including the low energy charge transfer excitation from helicenes to BTD. The enantiomerically pure fluorophores (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene), which exist in solution as two main conformers, according to the DFT calculations, show CPL activity in solution, with glum factors of &#8776;1.7&#215;10&#8722;3 at &#955;em=525&#8197;nm, and also in the solid state, with glum factors of &#8776;1.2&#215;10&#8722;3 in spite of the strong decrease of the quantum efficiency.

         <title>Functional Linkers Support Targeting of Multivalent Tweezers to Taspase1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taspase 1 is a unique protease not only pivotal for embryonic development but also implicated in leukemias and solid tumors. As such, this enzyme is a promising while still challenging therapeutic target, and with its protein structure featuring a flexible loop preceding the active site a versatile model system for drug development. Supramolecular ligands provide a promising complementary approach to traditional small&#8208;molecule inhibitors. Recently, the multivalent arrangement of molecular tweezers allowed the successful targeting of Taspase 1&#8217;s surface loop. With this study we now want to take the next logic step und utilize functional linker systems that not only allow the implementation of novel properties but also engage in protein surface binding. Consequently, we chose two different linker types differing from the original divalent assembly: a backbone with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties to enable monitoring of binding and a calix[4]arene scaffold initially pre&#8208;positioning the supramolecular binding units. With a series of four AIE&#8208;equipped ligands with stepwise increased valency we demonstrated that the functionalized AIE linkers approach ligand binding affinities in the nanomolar range and allow efficient proteolytic inhibition of Taspase 1. Moreover, implementation of the calix[4]arene backbone further enhanced the ligands&#8217; inhibitory potential, pointing to a specific linker contribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly graphitized coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon as high&#8208;performance lithium storage materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because of its high specific capacity and superior rate performance, porous carbon is regarded as a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, porous carbon materials with wide pore diameter distributions suffer from low structural stability and low electrical conductivity during the application process. During this study, the calcium carbonate nanoparticle template method is used to prepare coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon (CTP&#8208;X). The coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon has a well&#8208;developed macroporous&#8208;mesoporous&#8208;microporous hierarchical porous network structure, which provides abundant active sites for Li+ storage, significantly reduces polarization and charge transfer resistance, shortens the diffusion path and promotes the rapid transport of Li+. More specifically, the CTP&#8208;2 anode shows high charge capacity (496.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1), excellent rate performance (413.6 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 500 mA g&#8208;1), and high cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 100% after 1,000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1). The clean and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale utilization of coal tar pitch will facilitate the development of high&#8208;performance anodes in the field of LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Catalytic Metal&#8208;Based Homogeneous&#8208;Heterogeneous Systems in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the same reaction media is a powerful, yet relatively unexplored approach in organic chemistry. This strategy can address important limitations associated with purely homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis such as the incompatibility of different catalytic species in solution, or the limited tunability of solid catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the facile reusability of the solid catalyst, contributes to increase the overall sustainability of the process. As a result, this semi&#8208;heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic approach has unlocked significant advances in organic chemistry, improving existing reactions and even enabling the discovery of novel transformations, exemplified by the formal alkane metathesis. This concept article aims to showcase the benefits of this strategy through exploration of diverse relevant examples from the literature, hoping to spur research on new metal&#8208;based homogeneous&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst combinations that will result in reactivity challenging to achieve by conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonium SF5&#8211; Salts Derived from Sulfur Hexafluoride as Deoxyfluorination Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur based deoxyfluorination reagents are usually derived from the corrosive gas SF4. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of an easily accessible phosphonium salt [(tmg)3PF]+SF5&#8211; (1) which was obtained from the reaction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine. The performance of this crystalline SF5&#8211; salt as a reagent in deoxyfluorination reactions was investigated together with a second SF5&#8211; salt [(R1)3PF]+SF5&#8211; (2) containing bulky substituents (R1 = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino). Both reagents proved to be effective for the deoxyfluorination of various functional groups including alcohols, anhydrides, and amides.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Linkers Enable High&#8208;Voltage Pyrrolidinium&#8208;based Dicationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel fluorinated, pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids (FDILs) as high&#8208;performance electrolytes in energy storage devices have been prepared, displaying unprecedented electrochemical stabilities (up to 7 V); thermal stability (up to 370 &#176;C) and ion transport (up to 1.45 mS cm&#8209;1). FDILs were designed with a fluorinated ether linker and paired with TFSI/FSI counterions. To comprehensively asess the impact of the fluorinated spacer on their electrochemical, thermal, and physico&#8208;chemical properties, a comparison with their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts was conducted. With a specific focus on their application as electrolytes in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the impact of the Li&#8208;salt on the characteristics of dicationic ILs was systematically evaluated. The incorporation of a fluorinated linker demonstrates significantly superior properties compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, presenting a promising alternative towards next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic Surface Potentials and Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Motifs of Substituted 2,1,3&#8208;Benzoselenadiazoles Probed via 77Se Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are moderately strong, directional, and specific non&#8208;covalent interactions that have garnered substantial interest over the last decades. However, ChB applications are currently hampered by a lack of methods to characterize and control chalcogen bonds. We report on the influence of various substituents (halogens, cyano, and methyl groups) on the observed self&#8208;complementary ChB networks of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles. From molecular electrostatic potential calculations, we show that the electrostatic surface potentials (ESP) of the &#963;&#8208;holes on selenium are largely influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of these substituents. Structural analyses via X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal a variety of ChB geometries and binding modes that are rationalized via the computed ESP maps, although the structure of 5,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazole also demonstrates the influence of steric interactions. 77Se solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, in particular the analysis of the selenium chemical shift tensors, is found to be an effective probe able to characterize both structural and electrostatic features of these self&#8208;complementary ChB systems. We find a positive correlation between the value of the ESP maxima at the &#963;&#8208;holes and the experimentally measured 77Se isotropic chemical shift, while the skew of the chemical shift tensor is established as a metric which is reflective of the ChB binding motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Protodeboronation in Cu&#8208;Mediated 19F/18F&#8208;Fluorination of Arylboronic Acids: A Mechanistically Guided Approach Towards Optimized PET Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for in vivo imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid 18F/19F&#8208;fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu&#8208;mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure with t&#8208;BuOH as solvent to enhance the nucleophilicity of fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2 was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30 minutes at a temperature of 60 &#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39% to 84% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in 18F&#8208;radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17&#8208;54% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling (E/Z)&#8208;Stereoselectivity of &#8208;NHC=O Chlorination: Mechanism Principles for Wide Scope Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic halogen compounds are cornerstones of applied chemical sciences. Halogen substitution is a smart molecular design strategy adopted to influence reactivity, membrane permeability and receptor interaction. Chiral bioreceptors may restrict the stereochemical requirements in the halo&#8208;ligand design. Straightforward (but expensive) catalyzed stereospecific halogenation has been reported. Historically, PCl5 served access to uncatalyzed stereoselective chlorination although the stereochemical outcomes were influenced by steric parameters. Nonetheless, stereochemical investigation of PCl5 reaction mechanism with carbamoyl (RCONHX) compounds has never been addressed. Herein, we provide the first comprehensive stereochemical mechanistic explanation outlining halogenation of carbamoyl compounds with PCl5; the key regioselectivity&#8208;limiting nitrilimine intermediate (8&#8208;Z.HCl); how substitution pattern influences regioselectivity; why oxadiazole byproduct (P1) is encountered; stereo&#8208;electronic factors influencing the hydrazonoyl chloride (P2) production; and discovery of two stereoselectivity&#8208;limiting parallel mechanisms (stepwise and concerted) of elimination of HCl and POCl3. DFT calculations, synthetic methodology optimization, X&#8208;ray evidence and experimental reaction kinetics study evidence all supported the suggested mechanism proposal (Scheme 2). Finally, we provide mechanism&#8208;inspired future recommendations for directing the reaction stereoselectivity toward elusive and stereochemically inaccessible (E)&#8208;bis&#8208;hydrazonoyl chlorides along with potentially pivotal applications of both (E/Z)&#8208;stereoisomers especially in medicinal chemistry and protein modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Searching for &#8220;Greener&#8221; Bioequivalents of CF3 to Lower its Environmental Impact</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the broad use of the trifluoromethyl functional group (&#8208;CF3) in medicinal chemistry and taking into account the recent concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we are searching for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. Thus, different chemical groups (i.e. iodide, fluoride, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, cyclobutyl, 3&#8208;oxetyl, 2&#8208;oxetyl, methylsulfide, pentafluorosulfide, methylsulfonyl and sulfonamide) have been considered as potential bioequivalents of &#8208;CF3 aiming to use them in compounds with therapeutic interest instead of the polyfluoride functionality. Different structural (molecular surface and volume) and physicochemical (electronic and lipophilic) aspects of the bioequivalent functionalities proposed have been theoretically calculated and compared to those of &#8208;CF3. Additionally, the corresponding phenyl derivatives carrying these functionalities have been purchased or prepared and their experimental lipophilicity (i.e. LogP) measured using shake&#8208;flask experiments and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited&#8208;state Dynamics in Segregated Donor&#8208;acceptor Stacks Versus A Peri&#8208;bisdonor&#8208;acceptor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of impact of through&#8208;space/through&#8208;bond electronic interaction among chromophores on photoexcited&#8208;state properties has immense potential owing to the distinct emergent photophysical pathways. Herein, the photoexcited&#8208;state dynamics of homo&#8208;sorted &#960;&#8208;stacked aggregates of a naphthalenemonoimide and perylene&#8208;based acceptor&#8208;donor (NI&#8208;Pe) system and a fork&#8208;shaped acceptor&#8208;bisdonor (NI&#8208;Pe2) system possessing integrally stacked peri&#8208;substituted donors was examined. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of NI&#8208;Pe monomer recorded in chloroform displayed spectroscopic signatures of the singlet state of Pe; 1Pe*, the charge&#8208;separated state; NI&#8208;&#9679;&#8208;Pe+&#9679;, and the triplet state of Pe; 3Pe*. The examination of ultrafast excited&#8208;state processes of NI&#8208;Pe aggregate in chloroform revealed faster charge recombination (&#120591;&#119862;&#119877;&#119886; = 1.75 ns) than the corresponding monomer (&#120591;&#119862;&#119877;&#119898; = 2.46 ns) which was followed by observation of a broad structureless band attributed to an excimer&#8208;like state. The fork&#8208;shaped NI&#8208;Pe2 displayed characteristic spectroscopic features of the NI radical anion (&#955;max~450 nm) and perylene dimer radical cation (&#955;max~520 nm) upon photoexcitation in non&#8208;polar toluene solvent in the nanosecond transient absorption (nsTA) spectroscopy. The investigation highlights the significance of intrinsic close&#8208;stacked arrangement of donors&#160;in ensuring a long&#8208;lived photoinduced charge&#8208;separated state (&#120591;&#119862;&#119877; = 1.35 &#956;s) in non&#8208;polar solvents via delocalization of radical cation between the donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrowband Blue Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitter based on BN&#8208;Doped Benzo[6]helicene with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;doped helicenes, known for their unique electronic and photophysical properties, are of great interest for numerous applications. This research introduces two new azabora[6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, synthesized through an efficient method. These molecules have boron and nitrogen atoms in opposing positions, enhancing their distinctive attributes. Both helicenes show excellent emission properties, with H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2 exhibiting narrowband blue fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), achieving glum values of 4~5 &#215;10&#8208;4 which is beneficial for chiroptical applications. The addition of a donor group, 3, 6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, in H[6]BN2 improves luminescence, likely due to enhanced molecular orbital overlap and electron delocalization. H[6]BN1's needle&#8208;like single crystals exhibit mechanochromism, changing luminescent color from yellow to green under mechanical stress, which is promising for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. In conclusion, this study presents a novel class of BN[6]helicenes with superior chiroptical properties. Their combination of electronic features and mechanochromism makes them ideal for advanced chiroptical materials, expanding the potential of helicene&#8208;based compounds and offering new directions for the synthesis of molecules with specific chiroptical characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Coordination Induced Further Deamination to Create Inter&#8208;Chain Cross&#8208;Linking in Carbon Nitride for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating cross&#8208;linking to establish efficient inter&#8208;chain charge&#8208;transfer channels in carbon nitride represents a promising strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic capabilities. Molten salt&#8208;assisted calcining has emerged as a method for preparing cross&#8208;linked carbon nitrides. However, the precise influence of molten salts on the molecular structure of carbon nitride remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we develop a KCl guided cross&#8208;linking reaction to preliminarily reveal the formation mechanism of cross&#8208;linking. The cross&#8208;linking reaction is initiated by the pre&#8208;coordination of amino groups with K+. Subsequent heating at high temperature converts the amino groups into chlorines. Then, dechlorination leads to the formation of cross&#8208;linking. Thus, this cross&#8208;linking reaction can be accurately described as a pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced, two&#8208;step deamination reaction. The pre&#8208;coordination step plays a pivotal role in the cross&#8208;linking process. Sufficient pre&#8208;coordination results in a relatively high cross&#8208;linking degree of the as&#8208;prepared CNK&#8208;2. Consequently, CNK&#8208;2 demonstrates a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production, with a generation rate of 682 &#956;mol&#183;L&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, about 59 times that of traditional carbon nitride.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead Bromide Complex in Tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine Oxide Matrix with Bright Photoluminance and Exceptional Thermoplasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide materials have recently drawn increasing research interest for their excellent opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, but their resulting rigid structures render them brittle and poor formability during manufacturing. Here we demonstrate a thermoplastic luminant hybrid lead halide solid by integrating lead bromide complex into tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) matrix. The construction of the hybrid materials can be achieved by a simple dissolution process, in which TOPO molecules act as the solvents and ligands to yield the monodispersed clusters. The combination of these functional units enables the near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing of the materials into targeted geometry by simple molding or printing techniques, which offer possibilities for fluorescent writing inks with outstanding self&#8208;healing capacity to physical damage. The intermarriage between metal halide clusters with functional molecules expands the range of practical applications for hybrid metal halide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Photophysical and Electronic Properties of a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Julolidine&#8208;Like Pyrenyl&#8208;o&#8208;Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to the analogous 2&#8208;(1&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))&#8208;pyrene, which exhibits dual fluorescence, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))&#8208;6,6,12,12&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;7,8,11,12&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;6H,10H&#8208;phenaleno[1,9&#8208;fg]pyrido[3,2,1&#8208;ij]quinoline (4), a julolidine&#8208;like pyrenyl&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, with pyrene substituted at the 2,7&#8208;positions on the HOMO/LUMO nodal plane, shows only single fluorescence, as the CT state involving the carborane as the acceptor moiety in not kinetically accessible, so a more localized CT emission involving the julolidine&#8208;like pyrene moiety is observed.







Abstract
We synthesized 2&#8208;(1&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))&#8208;6,6,12,12&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;7,8,11,12&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;6H,10H&#8208;phenaleno[1,9&#8208;fg]pyrido[3,2,1&#8208;ij]quinoline (4), a julolidine&#8208;like pyrenyl&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, with pyrene substituted at the 2,7&#8208;positions on the HOMO/LUMO nodal plane. Using solid state molecular structures, photophysical data, cyclic voltammetry, DFT and LR&#8208;TDDFT calculations, we compare o&#8208;carborane and B(Mes)2 (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) as acceptor groups.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transfer: Enhancing Chemical Diversity for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric carbene transfer reactions increase molecular diversity for drug discovery.







Abstract
The quest to explore chemical space is vital for identifying novel disease targets, impacting both the effectiveness and safety profile of therapeutic agents. The tangible chemical space, currently estimated at a conservative 108 synthesized compounds, pales in comparison to the theoretically conceivable diversity of 1060 molecules. To bridge this vast gap, organic chemists are spearheading innovative methodologies that promise to broaden this limited chemical diversity. A beacon of this progressive wave is Asymmetric Carbene Transfer (ACT), a burgeoning strategy that significantly boosts molecular diversity with efficient bond&#8208;formation and precise chiral control. This review focuses on the capabilities of ACT in creating pharmaceutically significant molecules, encompassing an array of natural products and bioactive compounds. Through the lens of ACT, we discern its substantial influence on drug discovery, paving the way for novel therapeutic avenues by expanding the boundaries of molecular diversity. This review will shed light on prospective methodological developments of ACT and articulate their conceivable contributions to the medicinal chemistry arena.

         <title>Polyarylene&#8208;Based Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyarylene&#8208;based anion exchange membranes feature ether&#8208;free, high molecular weight, and high pKa aromatic polymer networks. Designing strategies, including balancing rigid and flexible segments in the backbone, installing side chains for flexibility and ion conduction, and mechanical stabilization through crosslinking, can realize long&#8208;term durable power generation from the assembled fuel cells.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is an emerging and promising technology that can help realize a carbon&#8208;neutral, sustainable economy. Also, compared to the proton exchange membrane counterpart, AEMFC can achieve comparable cell outputs with lower costs due to the applicability of non&#8208;platinum group metal electrocatalysts for the reaction on the electrodes&#8217; surfaces. However, the wide application of the AEMFCs has been impeded by the unsatisfactory stability and performance of the hydroxide&#8208;conductive membranes in the past. Recently researchers have made breakthroughs using polyarylene (PA)&#8208;based AEMs. This article summarizes the recent advances of a class of AEMs with aromatic backbone without ether bonds, mainly synthesized by Friedel&#8211;Crafts polycondensation. Such PA&#8208;based AEMs showed high chemical/mechanical stabilities and ionic conductivity, and even the fuel cell with those AEMs showed impressive peak power density of up to 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In this concept article, we classify major strategies for making PA&#8208;based AEMs to show the recent trends, highlight synthesis, characterization, and properties, and provide a brief outlook.

         <title>Nature Products Chlorophyll Derivatives for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging and Plant&#8208;Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorophyll, the most well&#8208;known natural product, has applications in a variety of fields, and we have applied it to NIR&#8208;II imaging for the first time, and the results show that it has great potential in plant and biological research.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) fluorescence imaging has attracted significant attention in research fields because of its unique advantages compared with conventional optical windows (400&#8211;900&#8197;nm). A variety of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores have been actively studied because they serve as a key component of fluorescence imaging. Among them, organic small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores display outstanding imaging performance and many advantages, but types of small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with high biocompatibility are still quite limited. Novel molecular scaffolds based NIR&#8208;II dyes are highly desired. Herein, we hypothesized that chlorophyll is a new promising molecular platform for discovery NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. Thus, seven derivatives of derivatives were selected to characterize their optical properties. Interestingly, six chlorophyll derivatives displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability. This characteristic allowed the successful NIR&#8208;II imaging of green leaves of various plants. Furthermore, most of these fluorophores showed capacity to monitor viscosity change because of their sensitive for viscosity. For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.

         <title>Enhancing Substrate Channeling with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Architectures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Situ encapsulation of multi&#8208;enzymes in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework was studied for Enhanced Substrate Channelling. The channel like porous structures within HOF facilitated the direct transfer of intermediates between GOx and HRP enzymes resulting in perfect substrate channeling with transient time close to 0&#8197;s. These HOF based structures also acted as protective barrier to preserve enzymes catalytic activity at extreme conditions prevalent at industrial processes.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) represent an emerging category of organic structures with high crystallinity and metal&#8208;free, which are not commonly observed in alternative porous organic frameworks. These needle&#8208;like porous structure can help in stabilizing enzymes and allow transfer of molecules between enzymes participating in cascade reactions for enhanced substrate channelling. Herein, we systematically synthesized and investigated the stability of HOF at extreme conditions followed by one&#8208;pot encapsulation of single and bi&#8208;enzyme systems. Firstly, we observed HOF to be stable at pH&#8197;1 to 14 and at high temperatures (up to 115&#8201;&#176;C). Secondly, the encapsulated glucose oxidase enzyme (GOX) showed 80&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% of its original activity at 70&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;11, respectively. Thirdly, transient time close to 0&#8197;seconds was observed for HOF encapsulated bi&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction system demonstrating a 4.25&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity when compared to free enzymes with enhanced substrate channelling. Our findings showcase a facile system synthesized under ambient conditions to encapsulate and stabilize enzymes at extreme conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Situ&lt;/i&gt; encapsulation of multi-enzymes in hydrogen-bonded organic framework was studied for Enhanced Substrate Channelling. The channel like porous structures within HOF facilitated the direct transfer of intermediates between GOx and HRP enzymes resulting in perfect substrate channeling with transient time close to 0&#8197;s. These HOF based structures also acted as protective barrier to preserve enzymes catalytic activity at extreme conditions prevalent at industrial processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOF) represent an emerging category of organic structures with high crystallinity and metal-free, which are not commonly observed in alternative porous organic frameworks. These needle-like porous structure can help in stabilizing enzymes and allow transfer of molecules between enzymes participating in cascade reactions for enhanced substrate channelling. Herein, we systematically synthesized and investigated the stability of HOF at extreme conditions followed by one-pot encapsulation of single and bi-enzyme systems. Firstly, we observed HOF to be stable at pH&#8197;1 to 14 and at high temperatures (up to 115&#8201;&#176;C). Secondly, the encapsulated glucose oxidase enzyme (GOX) showed 80&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% of its original activity at 70&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;11, respectively. Thirdly, transient time close to 0&#8197;seconds was observed for HOF encapsulated bi-enzyme cascade reaction system demonstrating a 4.25-fold improvement in catalytic activity when compared to free enzymes with enhanced substrate channelling. Our findings showcase a facile system synthesized under ambient conditions to encapsulate and stabilize enzymes at extreme conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This house of cards is a fragile construct that can collapse if the wrong move is made. Similarly, the stability of the small superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is a fragile equilibrium that is delicately balanced by donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Too much fluoride leads to superelectrophilic reactions, while too little fluoride means missing stabilization of the C2h structure. More information on how this balance is achieved can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400354).

         <title>Selective Transition Enhancement in a g&#8208;Engineered Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric diradical was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#8901; radical system. The molecule was shown to exhibit a weak exchange interaction between its two radical units. The g&#8208;asymmetry combined with the magnetic interaction led to the electron paramagnetic resonance transition of different tipping angles, which could be selectively enhanced by proper choice of applied magnetic field and microwave power. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;K. Boudalis, A. Mizuno, M. Ruben and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400420).

         <title>The Influence of Disulfide, Thioacetal and Lanthionine&#8208;Bridges on the Conformation of a Macrocyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclisation of peptides by forming thioether (lanthionine), disulfide (cystine) or methylene thioacetal bridges between side chains is established as an important tool to stabilise a given structure, enhance metabolic stability and optimise both potency and selectivity. However, a systematic comparative study of the effects of differing bridging modalities on peptide conformation has not previously been carried out. In this paper, we have used the NMR deconvolution algorithm, NAMFIS, to determine the conformational ensembles, in aqueous solution, of three cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8208;7), incorporating either disulfide, or non&#8208;reduceable thioether or methylene thioacetal bridges. We demonstrate that the major solution conformations are conserved between the different bridged peptides, but the distribution of conformations differs appreciably. This suggests that subtle differences in ring size and bridging structure can be exploited to fine&#8208;tune the conformational properties of cyclic peptides, which may modulate their bioactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Initiation and Reactions of Thiyl Radicals Studied with SH2&#8217; Radical Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A radical trapping method based on an SH2&#8217; homolytic substitution reaction was applied to study the mechanism of a photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones in the presence of thiols. Starting material, products and a range of trapped radical intermediates were simultaneously detected in reaction mixtures by mass spectrometry (MS). The trapped intermediates included both initiating and main chain propagating radicals. These data made it possible to propose a self&#8208;initiation mechanism consistent with the originally postulated photoexcitation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex of the substrate. The effect of thiol structure on the MS peak intensity of the reaction components was rationalised in terms of the relative stability of the radical intermediates. The results were compared to a simpler related reaction, a photochemical thiol&#8208;ene addition where reagents, products and trapped intermediate radicals were also detected by MS. Relative MS peak intensities were again explained by a combination of electronic and steric effects on the stability of intermediate radicals. Overall, SH2&#8217; radical trapping was demonstrated to be a powerful experimental technique for providing mechanistic evidence on photochemical and other organic radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>De&#8208; and Rearomatisation of Pyridine in Silylene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods relying on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation for activating pyridine bonds in de&#8208; and rearomatisation are being challenged by the abundant metal&#8208;free element species as alternatives. Here, we investigate the de/re&#8208;aromatisation of pyridine facilitated by pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene reactions with ketones and ketene. The reactivity outcome is highly dependent on the substituents on the ketones. By carefully tuning the steric demand of the ketone, each intermediate of the reaction sequence could be isolated. At room temperature, benzophenone and acetophenone substrates led to dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety, with the case of acetophenone showing an intermediate silaoxirane preceding dearomatisation. However, when subjected to acetone or diphenylketene, only silaoxiranes were formed without dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety. Notably, only benzophenone&#8208;derived dearomatised species demonstrate rearomatisation upon heating. Furthermore, the reduced steric bulk of the ketene facilitated further ring expansion with another equivalent of the substrate, forming sila&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolanes. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomeric Fe(III)&#8208;Hydroxo and Fe(III)&#8208;Aqua Complexes Display Oxidative Asynchronous Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua&#8208;ligated iron(III) complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ (R = OMe, H, Cl, NO2), supported by an amide&#8208;containing pentadentate N5 donor ligand, L5R [HL5R = 2&#8208;(((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl)amino)&#8208;N&#8208;(5&#8208;R&#8208;quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+, were generated in situ by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)&#8208;aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo&#8208; and aqua&#8208;complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L5R ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&#951;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogues. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ET&#8208;PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Delivery Relevant to Human Health using Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids. Specific topics include the use of MOFs and zeolites to deliver H2S for therapeutic applications, 129Xe for magnetic resonance imaging, O2 for the treatment of cancer and hypoxia, and various gases for use in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to bring together the organic, inorganic, medicinal, and materials chemistry communities to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation porous materials for the storage and delivery of medicinally relevant gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Photophysical Characterization of Biocompatible Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Carbazole&#8208;Coumarins for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins exhibiting good photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been designed and synthetized using computer&#8208;aided density functional theory calculations. The TADF characteristics of the carbazole&#8208;coumarins were systematically explored both in solution and in the solid state, utilizing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a matrix. The study revealed that the introduction of carbazole units onto the coumarin benzene ring led to compounds with thermally induced reverse intersystem crossing and delayed fluorescence. The study further demonstrated the potential utility of these compounds in practical applications by incorporating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection. The resulting sensor exhibited promising performance, highlighting the adaptability and efficacy of the synthesized TADF&#8208;carbazole&#8208;coumarin compounds for reversible molecular oxygen sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Perovskite Phases with Different Cation Orders in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation orders in both A and B sites can be controlled in the Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 perovskite solid solutions via aliovalent doping by Sb5+ only at B site realizing A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered/B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered, A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered/B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered, and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered/B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered structures.







Abstract
Cation order, which can be controlled by synthesis conditions and stoichiometry, plays an important role in properties of perovskite materials. Here we show that aliovalent doping by Sb5+ in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 quadruple perovskite solid solutions can control cation orders in both A and B sites. Samples with 0.4&#8804;x&#8804;2 were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature method at 6&#8197;GPa and 1770&#8197;K. Three regions with different cation orders were found at 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0, x=1.5&#8211;1.6, and x=1.8. The 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0 compositions have a B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/nmc; the x=1.5 and 1.6 samples have a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/n; the x=1.8 sample has a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered structure with space group P21/n. All the samples show one ferrimagnetic transition: TC increases from 35&#8197;K to 73&#8197;K for 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0, TC=81&#8197;K for x=1.5 and 1.6, and TC=53&#8197;K for x=1.8.

         <title>Superlong Metal&#8208;organic Framework Nanowire Fabricated via Steam&#8208;assisted Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their outstanding anisotropic and linear structures. A facile method is developed to fabricate 1D copper metal&#8208;organic framework nanowires (Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW) through steam&#8208;assisted conversion from Cu&#8208;MOF precursors. During the steam&#8208;assisted conversion, Cu&#8208;MOF precursor gradually dissolves in methanol steam, and then recrystallized into Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, which shows high aspect ratio of about 600 and identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74. As&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW with multiscale porous structure can effectively remove cationic dyes even in dye mixture. Moreover, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, as an ideal template, is calcined to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with maintaining its 1D morphology, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the non&#8208;enzymatic sensing of glucose.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust, Reproducible, and Scalable Synthesis of Silver Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18 to 60&#8197;nm was developed. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents, allowing for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches.







Abstract
It remains a challenge to accomplish colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals marked by high quality, large quantity, and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency. Here we report a self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18 to 60&#8197;nm. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents. The new setup also allows us to easily optimize the amount of O2 (from air) trapped in the system, ensuring burst nucleation of single&#8208;crystal seeds, followed by their slow growth into nanocubes. Most significantly, the new setup allows for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches. The availability of high&#8208;quality Ag nanocubes in such a large quantity is anticipated to substantially boost their use in applications related to plasmonics, catalysis, and biomedicine.

         <title>Reactivity of a Neutral Yttrium(III) Trimethyl Complex toward Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 9&#8208;membered azacrown Me3TACN offers a versatile platform for examining multiple Y&#8722;Me reactivity/conversion. Neither steric pressure nor nitrophilic substrates favor displacement of Me3TACN, marking its suitability for assessing ligand class&#8208;dependent incremental 89Y NMR chemical shifts.







Abstract
The present study corroborates that the neutral tridentate N&#8208;ligand 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;triazacyclononane (Me3TACN) qualifies as a versatile platform to study selective ligand exchange with rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal alkyl complexes, herein [(Me3TACN)YMe3]. Treatment with Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic bis(dimethylsilyl)amine, HN(SiHMe2)2, gave selectively the mono&#8208;exchanged heteroleptic complex [(Me3TACN)YMe2{N(SiHMe2)2}]. Depending on the molecular ratio employed, the reaction of [(Me3TACN)YMe3] with AlMe3 resulted in the isolation/crystallization of [(Me3TACN)YMe2(AlMe4)] [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] or ion&#8208;separated [(Me3TACN)YMe(AlMe4)][AlMe4] [1&#8201;:&#8201;2] and [(Me3TACN)YMe(AlMe4)][Al2Me7] [1&#8201;:&#8201;3]. Analogous reactions with the heavier group 13 methyls GaMe3 and InMe3 generated mixed methyl/tetramethylgallato complex [(Me3TACN)YMe2(GaMe4)] and ion&#8208;separated [{(Me3TACN)YMe2}2{&#956;&#8208;Me}][InMe4]. Finally, dimethylalane, HAlMe2, converted [(Me3TACN)YMe3] into heteroaluminate [(Me3TACN)Y(HAlMe3)3], representing an AlMe3&#8208;supported, molecular yttrium trihydride complex. All compounds were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), homo&#8208; and heteronuclear (13C, 27Al, 89Y, 115In) NMR as well as IR spectroscopies and elemental analyses.

         <title>CoPS/Co4S3 Heterojunction with Highly Exposed Active Sites and Dual&#8208;site Synergy for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoPS and hexagonal Co4S3 were constructed into heterojunctions. The strain effect and the high specific surface area fully expose the reactive active sites. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively.







Abstract
Cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) has recently been recognized as a potentially effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there have been no research on the design of CoPS&#8208;based heterojunctions to boost their HER performance. Herein, CoPS/Co4S3 heterojunction was prepared by phosphating treatment based on defect&#8208;rich flower&#8208;like Co1&#8208;xS precursors. The high specific surface area of nanopetals, together with the heterojunction structure with inhomogeneous strain, exposes more active sites in the catalyst. The electronic structure of the catalyst is reconfigured as a result of the interfacial interactions, which promote the catalyst&#8216;s ability to adsorb hydrogen and conduct electricity. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which renders it competitive with previously reported analogous catalysts. This work proposes an effective technique for constructing transition metal phosphosulfide heterojunctions, as well as the development of an efficient HER electrocatalyst.

         <title>KpsS1 Mediates the Glycosylation of Pseudaminic Acid in Acinetobacter Baumannii</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the critical role of potential glycosyltransferase KpsS1 in the glycosylation of Pseudaminic acid (Pse) in Acinetobacter baumannii, resulting in the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins. Furthermore, the glycosylation of Pse influences the morphology of A. baumannii and enhances the virulence potential of the bacterium in a mouse model.







Abstract
Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is found in the polysaccharide structures of the cell surface of various Gram&#8208;negative pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii and considered as an important component of cell surface glycans including oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. However, the glycosyltransferase that is responsible for the Pse glycosylation in A. baumannii remains unknown yet. In this study, through comparative genomics analysis of Pse&#8208;positive and negative A. baumannii clinical isolates, we identified a potential glycosyltransferase, KpsS1, located right downstream of the Pse biosynthesis genetic locus. Deletion of this gene in an Pse&#8208;positive A. baumannii strain, Ab8, impaired the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins, while the gene knockout strain, Ab8&#916;kpsS1, could still produce Pse with 2.86 folds higher amount than that of Ab8. Furthermore, impairment of Pse glycosylation affected the morphology and virulence potential of A. baumannii, suggesting the important role of this protein. This study will provide insights into the further understanding of Pse in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the critical role of potential glycosyltransferase KpsS1 in the glycosylation of Pseudaminic acid (Pse) in &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins. Furthermore, the glycosylation of Pse influences the morphology of &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; and enhances the virulence potential of the bacterium in a mouse model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is found in the polysaccharide structures of the cell surface of various Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria including &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; and considered as an important component of cell surface glycans including oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. However, the glycosyltransferase that is responsible for the Pse glycosylation in &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; remains unknown yet. In this study, through comparative genomics analysis of Pse-positive and negative &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; clinical isolates, we identified a potential glycosyltransferase, KpsS1, located right downstream of the Pse biosynthesis genetic locus. Deletion of this gene in an Pse-positive &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; strain, Ab8, impaired the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins, while the gene knockout strain, Ab8&#916;&lt;i&gt;kpsS1&lt;/i&gt;, could still produce Pse with 2.86 folds higher amount than that of Ab8. Furthermore, impairment of Pse glycosylation affected the morphology and virulence potential of &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the important role of this protein. This study will provide insights into the further understanding of Pse in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A &#946;&#8208;Glucosyl Sterol Probe for in&#8197;situ Fluorescent Labelling in Neuronal Cells to Investigate Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at tackling neurodegenerative diseases, the potential effect of &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol on neuronal cells is investigated by means of fluorescent labelling of a synthetic derivative. Marked differences in neuron accumulation, metabolism, and impact on the lysosomes with respect to the un&#8208;glycosylated cholesterol derivative were observed.







Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol probe bearing a terminal alkyne moiety for fluorescent tagging enables the investigation of the neuronal and intracellular localization of this class of compounds involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The compound showed localization in the neuronal cells, with marked differences in the uptake and metabolism leading to enhanced persistence with respect to the un&#8208;glycosylated sterol analogue. In addition, a different impact was observed towards lysosomes, with the simple sterol probe showing the enlargement of the lysosome structures, while the &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol was less capable to alter the morphology of this specific organelle.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a water&#8208;soluble, oxygen&#8208;tolerant, and acid&#8208;stable synthetic H2 production catalyst is vital for renewable energy infrastructure. To access such an effective catalyst, we strategically incorporated enzyme&#8208;inspired, multicomponent outer coordination sphere elements around the cobaloxime (Cl&#8211;Co&#8211;X) core with suitable axial coordination (X). Our cobaloximes with axial imidazole or L&#8208;histidine coordination in photocatalytic HAT including the construction of anilines via a non&#8208;canonical cross&#8208;coupling approach is found superior compared to commonly used cobaloxime catalysts. The reversible Co(II)/Co(I) process is influenced by the axial N ligand's nature. Imidazole/ L&#8208;histidine with a higher pKa promptly produces H2 upon irradiation, leading to the improved reactivity compared to previously employed axial (di)chloride or pyridine analogue.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How to coordinate electron and ion transport behavior across scales and interfaces within ion battery electrodes? The exponential increase in surface area observed in nanoscale electrode materials results in an incomprehensibly vast spatial interval. Herein, to address the problems of volume expansion, dissolution of cathode material, and the charge accumulation problem existing in manganiferous materials for zinc ion batteries, metal organic framework is utilized to form the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking ~10 nm Mn2O3 nanoparticles and amorphous carbon hybrid electrode materials, demonstrating a high specific capacity of 361 mAh g&#8208;1 (0.1 A g&#8208;1), and excellent cycle stability of 105 mAh g&#8208;1 after 2000 cycles under 1 A g&#8208;1. The uniform and non&#8208;separated disposition of Mn and C atoms constitutes an interconnected network with high electronic and ionic conductivity, minimizing issues like structural collapse and volume expansion of the electrode material during cycling. The cooperative insert mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ are analyzed via ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests. The model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. The results indicate that MOF&#8208;derived carbonization provides an effective strategy for exploring Mn&#8208;based electrode materials with high ion and electron transport capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Hierarchical Superstructures from Micellar Units: Stiff Hydrogels and Anisotropic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular materials have been assembled using a wide range of interactions, including the hydrophobic effect, DNA base&#8208;pairing, and hydrogen bonding. Specifically, DNA amphiphiles with a hydrophobic building block self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies depending on the length and composition of both blocks. Herein, we take advantage of the orthogonality of different supramolecular interactions &#8211; the hydrophobic effect, Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;Franklin base pairing and RNA kissing loops &#8211; to create hierarchical self&#8208;assemblies with controlled morphologies on both the nanometer and the micrometer scales. Assembly through base&#8208;pairing leads to the formation of hybrid, multi&#8208;phasic hydrogels with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties. Assembly via hydrophobic core interactions gives anisotropic, discrete assemblies, where DNA fibers with one sequence are terminated with DNA spheres bearing different sequences. This work opens new avenues for the bottom&#8208;up construction of DNA&#8208;based materials, with promising applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the creation of complex DNA structures from a minimum array of components.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Synthesis of Tweezer Dyads for H&#8208;Bond Assisted Cooperativity in Tandem Uncaging Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: &#8220;Tandem&#8221; uncaging systems, in which a photolabile protecting group (PPG) is sensitized by an energy&#8208;harvesting antenna, may increase the photosensitivity of PPGs by several orders of magnitude for two&#8208;photon (2P) photorelease. Yet, they remain poorly accessible because of arduous multi&#8208;step synthesis. In this work, we design efficient tandem uncaging systems by (i) using a convenient assembly of the building blocks relying on click chemistry, (ii) H&#8208;bonding induced proximity thus facilitating (iii) photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a cooperative mechanism. A strong two&#8208;photon absorber electron&#8208;donating quadrupolar antenna and various electron&#8208;accepting PPGs (mDEAC, MNI or MDNI) were clicked stepwise onto a &#8220;tweezer&#8208;shaped&#8221; pyrido&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate platform whose H&#8208;bonding and p&#8208;stacking abilities were exploited to keep the antenna and the PPGs in close proximity. The different electron acceptor ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo&#8208;uncaging ability due to their too high electron accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (Fu=0.38) compared to mDEAC (Fu=0.014). The unique resulted in large 2P photo&#8208;sensitivity in the near&#8208;infrared window (240 GM at 710 nm).</dc:description>

The different electron acceptor ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo-uncaging ability due to their too high electron accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (Fu=0.38) compared to mDEAC (Fu=0.014). The unique resulted in large 2P photo-sensitivity in the near-infrared window (240 GM at 710 nm).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts. The underlying physical principle of this control is the sensitivity of the Fermi level to metal&#8208;metal contacts. This change in electronic structure has a direct impact on surface properties and chemical reactivity. The concept article briefly introduces the basic theory of CE and its relationship to catalytic performance. We then highlight selected recent examples of advances in the preparation of hybrid metal NP assemblies, experimental techniques for characterizing CE, and finally applications of CE for altering catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Wittig Reaction in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Expanding the DES Toolbox in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wittig reaction between substituted phosphonium salts and (hetero)aromatic and alkyl carbonyl compounds in Deep Eutectic Solvents has been developed under a scalable and friendly protocol. Highly efficient reactions were successfully run with a wide range of bases including organic (DBU, LiTMP, t&#8208;BuOK) and inorganic (NaOH, Na2CO3, K2CO3) ones in ChCl/Gly 1:2 (mol/mol) as solvent under mild conditions, at room temperature and under air. The proposed protocol was applied to a wide range of substrates, including (hetero)aromatic aldehydes with substituents as halogens (I, Br, Cl), EDG (alkoxy, methyl), EWG (NO2, CF3) or reactive groups as CN, esters, and ketones. Vinylic, alkynyl and cycloalkyl, alicyclic and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes can also be used. Highly electrophilic ketones gave good yields. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is in complete agreement with the E/Z ratio observed under traditional conditions. We demonstrated that the reaction is scalable to 2 g (5 mmol) of phosphonium salt, furthermore the proposed workup protocol allows to remove TPPO without need of additional chromatographic purification.</dc:description>

         <title>The Hybridization of Polymers with Metal Oxide Clusters for the Design of Non&#8208;Fluorinated Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key component of various energy storage and conversion devices, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) have been attracting significant interest. However, their further development is limited by the high cost of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers and the poor stability of acid&#8208;dopped non&#8208;fluorinated polymers. Recently, a new group of PEMs has been developed by hybridizing polyoxometalates (POMs), a group of super acidic sub&#8208;nanoscale metal oxide clusters, with polymers. POMs can serve simultaneously as both proton sponges and stabilizing agents, and their complexation with polymers can further improve polymers&#8217; mechanical performance and processability. Enormous efforts have been focused on studying supramolecular complexation or covalent grafting of POMs with various polymers to optimize PEMs in terms of cost, mechanical properties and stabilities. This concept summarizes recent advances in this emerging field and outlines the design strategies and application perspectives employed for using POM&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as PEMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of weak organic acids as coagulants on tailoring the properties of cellulose aerogel beads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring the properties of cellulose aerogel beads was investigated in the present study by using weak organic acids as coagulants. Three different weak acids were specifically chosen, acetic acid, lactic acid and citric acid. For comparative studies, a strong acid, hydrochloric acid was examined. The production of aerogel beads by conventional dropping technique was controlled and optimized for weak acids. Aerogels were characterized by density analyses, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption analysis, X&#8208;ray powder diffractometry and IR spectroscopy. In common, all the aerogel beads showed interconnected nanofibrillar network, high specific surface area, high pore volume, high porosity and meso&#8208; and macroporous structure. In particular, when the weakest acid (acetic acid) was used as coagulant in the regeneration bath, the lowest shrinkage was observed. As a result, the cellulose aerogel beads produced from acetic acid showed the highest values of specific surface area (423 m2&#183;g&#8208;1) and pore volume (3.6 cm3&#183;g&#8208;1). The porous structure can be tuned by the choice of regeneration bath having either strong acid or high concentration of weak acid. The aerogel beads were pure and showed cellulose II crystallinity. Hence this study paves an alternative path way to tailor the properties of cellulose aerogel beads.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Cross&#8208;Plane Conductance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the cross&#8208;plane single&#8208;molecule junctions, the correlation between molecular aromaticity and conductance remained puzzling. Cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) provides new insight into understanding the role of aromaticity and conjugation to molecules on charge transport through the planar molecules. In this work, we investigated the modulation of cross&#8208;plane charge transport in pyrene derivatives by hydrogenation and substituents based on the XPBJ method that differs from those used in&#8208;plane transport. We measured the electrical conductance of the hydrogenated derivatives of the pyrenes and found that hydrogenation reduces conductance, and the fully hydrogenated molecule has the lowest conductance. Conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. By calculating, the trend in decreased conductance of hydrogenated pyrene was found to be consistent with the change in aromaticity. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents reduce the aromaticity of the molecule and narrow the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while electron&#8208;donating groups increase the aromaticity but also narrow the gap. Our work reveals the potential of fine&#8208;tuning the structure of the pyrene molecule to control the cross&#8208;plane charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions.</dc:description>

         <title>U(V) Stabilization via Aliovalent Incorporation of Ln(III) into Oxo&#8208;salt Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ln(UVO2)W4O14 series are the inaugural materials to structurally integrate pentavalent uranium with rare&#8208;earth metals, featuring a unique U&#8722;Ln cation interaction. This occurs when Ln3+ ions replace Ca2+ in the crystal, they add extra positive charge, causing a charge imbalance that oxidizes uranium from U(VI) to U(V).







Abstract
Pentavalent uranium compounds are key components of uranium&#8216;s redox chemistry and play important roles in environmental transport. Despite this, well&#8208;characterized U(V) compounds are scarce primarily because of their instability with respect to disproportionation to U(IV) and U(VI). In this work, we provide an alternate route to incorporation of U(V) into a crystalline lattice where different oxidation states of uranium can be stabilized through the incorporation of secondary cations with different sizes and charges. We show that iriginite&#8208;based crystalline layers allow for systematically replacing U(VI) with U(V) through aliovalent substitution of 2+ alkaline&#8208;earth or 3+ rare&#8208;earth cations as dopant ions under high&#8208;temperature conditions, specifically Ca(UVIO2)W4O14 and Ln(UVO2)W4O14 (Ln=Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb). Evidence for the existence of U(V) and U(VI) is supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorption spectroscopy. In contrast with other reported U(V) materials, the U(V) single crystals obtained using this route are relatively large (several centimeters) and easily reproducible, and thus provide a substantial improvement in the facile synthesis and stabilization of U(V).

Evidence for the existence of U(V) and U(VI) is supported by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, high energy resolution X-ray absorption near edge structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorption spectroscopy. In contrast with other reported U(V) materials, the U(V) single crystals obtained using this route are relatively large (several centimeters) and easily reproducible, and thus provide a substantial improvement in the facile synthesis and stabilization of U(V).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of CO2 Activation: Insights Into Metal&#8208;Metal Cooperativity and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling with {3d&#8211;4f} Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the activation of CO2 by 3d&#8211;4f catalysts, our combined DFT and ab initio calculations reveal the significance of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity and the role of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in fine&#8208;tuning catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into useful chemicals using metal catalysts is a significant challenge in chemistry. Among the various catalysts reported, transition metal lanthanide hybrid {3d&#8211;4f} complexes stand out for their superior efficiency and site selectivity. However, unlike transition metal catalysts, understanding the origin of this efficiency in lanthanides poses a challenge due to their orbital degeneracy, rendering the application of DFT methods ineffective. In this study, we employed a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations to explore the mechanism of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate using a 3d&#8211;4f heterometallic catalyst for the first time. This work unveils the importance of 3d and 4f metal cooperativity and the role of individual spin&#8208;orbit states in dictating the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

         <title>Rapid Access to Divergent Fused Polycycles Via One&#8208;Pot A3 Coupling and Intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of one&#8208;pot reaction and a derivation step is developed for concise construction of divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems from simple starting materials, providing a rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological activities. The one&#8208;pot reaction combines aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions under simple, open&#8208;air conditions.







Abstract
Divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems are constructed from simple starting materials via a one&#8208;pot aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. This domino reaction directly furnishes linear 5/5/5 and 5/5/6, or nonlinear 5/5/6/5, polycyclic rings containing an oxa&#8208;bridged fused 5/5 bicycle and a 1,6&#8208;enyne substructure. One&#8208;step derivation of the oxa&#8208;bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back&#8208;to&#8208;back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5&#8208;membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one&#8208;pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non&#8208;biological activities or functions.

         <title>A Type of Stable Amides Behaves as Acyl Transfer Reagents upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation through Self&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stable amides is synthesized, which can react with various nucleophiles like acyl chlorides under light irradiation. This controllable switched&#8208;on reactivity hinges on a rational&#8208;designed photo&#8208;activatable masked acyl donor reagent.







Abstract
Organic molecules with light&#8208;modifiable reactivity are important in many fields because they can serve as the &#8220;switch&#8221; for light to trigger chemical processes. Herein, we disclose a new type of stable non&#8208;twisted amides, the reactivity of which can be turned on by light as acyl transfer reagents. Upon photo&#8208;activation, these amides react with various nucleophiles including amines, phenols, hydroxide, thiols, boronic acids, and alkynes either under metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reactivity hinges on the design and synthesis of a photo&#8208;activatable reagent (7&#8208;nitro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrophenanthridine), which undergoes self&#8208;aromatization enabled by an internal oxidant under light. This masked acyl donor group is anticipated to be useful in scenarios where light is preferred to trigger a chemical process.

         <title>A fluorescent gemcitabine prodrug that follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent internalization and bears enhanced therapeutic efficacy with respect to gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its in vivo visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its in vivo efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning GF as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B2cat2) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8211;B bond activation by a special&#160;apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including in situ NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8211;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing color transitions for three copper (I) cluster organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials by adjusting reaction conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57% to 88%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow CeO2&#8208;Base Nanozyme with Self&#8208;Accelerated Cascade Reactions for Combined Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have obvious advantages in improving the efficiency of cancer treatment. However, due to the lack of tissue specificity, low catalytic efficiency, and so on, their clinical applications are limited. Herein, the nanoplatform CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA (CIGH) with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions is constructed. The as&#8208;prepared nanozyme shows the superior oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like, superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like, and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities. At the same time, under 808 nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the photodynamic and photothermal capabilities are also significantly enhanced due to the presence of indocyanine green (ICG). We demonstrate that the nanozyme CIGH can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity through the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and starvation therapy. The nanozyme prepared in this study provides a promising candidate for catalytic nanomedicines for efficient tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Lyso&#8211;H2S: A Mycophenolic Acid&#8208;Derived Probe for Ultra&#8208;Low Toxicity, Intracellular H2S Detection, and Zebrafish Model Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In several biological processes, H2S is known to function as an endogenous gaseous agent. It is very necessary to monitor H2S and relevant physiological processes in vivo. Herein, a new type of fluorophore with a reliable leaving group allows for excited&#8208;state intramolecular transfer characteristics (ESIPT), inspired by mycophenolic acid. A morpholine ring was connected at the maleimide position to target the lysosome. Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probe Lyso&#8211;H2S. Lyso&#8211;H2S demonstrated strong selectivity towards H2S, large Stokes shift (111 nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8 nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H2S in living cells (A549 cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra&#8208;low toxicity (100 % cell viability at 50 &#181;M concentration of Lyso&#8211;H2S.) Additionally, Lyso&#8211;H2S was also employed to visualize the activity of H2S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H2S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Tetranuclear Copper(I) and Gold(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes: A Phosphine Acetylide Amidinate Orthogonal Ligand Framework for Selective Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent tetranuclear heterobimetallic complexes: Heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes with phosphine acetylide amidinate ligand were synthesized by using different reaction pathways. These complexes are found to be luminescent and differ in terms of ancillary ligands at AuI centre.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphine acetylide amidinate stabilized copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes was achieved by reacting ligand [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)3] (Dipp=2,6&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with CuCl and Au(tht))Cl, yielding the eight membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] and the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2]. {Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] features a Cu2 unit, which is bridged by two amidinate ligands, served as a metalloligand to synthesize the heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, C6F5). In these reactions, the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2] was reacted with CuX (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to the rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu2 ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.

         <title>Recent Progress in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF molecules featuring an efficient intersystem crossing process have become increasingly crucial and potential photosensitizers for the PDT process. This review presents the key characteristics of TADF photosensitizers for the specific requirements, such as their water dispersibility, targeting ability, activability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Furthermore, future challenges and prospects of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are suggested.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly growing discipline that is expected to become an encouraging noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In the PDT process, an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) process for photosensitizers from the singlet excited state (S1) to the triplet excited state (T1) is critical for the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and improvement of PDT performance. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules featuring an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and an efficient ISC process represent an enormous breakthrough for the PDT process. Consequently, the development of advanced TADF photosensitizers has become increasingly crucial and pressing. The most recent developments in TADF photosensitizers aimed at enhancing PDT efficiency for bio&#8208;applications are presented in this review. TADF photosensitizers with water dispersibility, targeting ability, activatable ability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties are highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;TADF molecules featuring an efficient intersystem crossing process have become increasingly crucial and potential photosensitizers for the PDT process. This review presents the key characteristics of TADF photosensitizers for the specific requirements, such as their water dispersibility, targeting ability, activability, and two-photon excitation properties. Furthermore, future challenges and prospects of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are suggested.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly growing discipline that is expected to become an encouraging noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In the PDT process, an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) process for photosensitizers from the singlet excited state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to the triplet excited state (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is critical for the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and improvement of PDT performance. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules featuring an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and an efficient ISC process represent an enormous breakthrough for the PDT process. Consequently, the development of advanced TADF photosensitizers has become increasingly crucial and pressing. The most recent developments in TADF photosensitizers aimed at enhancing PDT efficiency for bio-applications are presented in this review. TADF photosensitizers with water dispersibility, targeting ability, activatable ability, and two-photon excitation properties are highlighted. Furthermore, the future challenges and perspectives of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Olefins Activated on Highly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Calcium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available salt of Ca2+ with weakly coordinating anion [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) exhibits high Lewis acidity comparable to SbF5. Reactivity studies show it is an effective catalyst for olefin hydrosilylation, yielding anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioisomer. Experimental and DFT studies indicate a unique mechanism for this type of reaction, which involves the activation of the olefin molecule by coordination with Ca2+.







Abstract
The report introduces simple yet highly reactive calcium salt, Ca[Al(ORF)4]2 (RF=C(CF3)3), 1, which effectively catalyses olefin hydrosilylation through an unusual mechanism involving the activation of the alkene molecule. Upon dissolution in o&#8208;difluorobenzene (oDFB), 1 forms a highly Lewis acidic [Ca(oDFB)6]2+ complex. Our DFT calculations reveal that fluoride ion affinity is comparable to SbF5. Reactivity tests show that it effectively catalyses the hydrosilylation of olefins with high regioselectivity, also in reactions involving sterically demanding substrates like (iPr)3SiH or tetrasubstituted olefins. Experimental and computational results point to the mechanism where the olefin molecule forms a complex with Ca2+, which significantly facilitates the attack of H&#8208;SiR3 on the C=C double bond.

Thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials in the future. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies for discussing the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. and the epoxies suitable for flexible electronic device can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains.







Abstract
With the popularization of 5G technology and artificial intelligence, thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials. Although many compounds containing both performances have been synthesized, there is little systematic theory to explain the coordination mechanism. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies to discuss the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. A series of electronic&#8208;grade biphenyl epoxies (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (1), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (2), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (3), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)butoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (4) were synthesized and characterized. Furthermore, they were cured with decanedioic acid to produce polymers. Results showed that alkyl chains can both affect the two properties, and the epoxies suitable for specific application scenarios can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. In terms of thermal conductivity, compound 1 was a most promising material. However, compound 4 was expected to be utilized in flexible electronic devices because of its acceptable thermal conductivity, self&#8208;healing ability, transparency, and flexibility.

         <title>Tetrazole and oxadiazole derivatives as thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising lighting solutions for sustainability and energy efficiency. Incorporating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules enables OLEDs to achieve internal quantum efficiency (IQE), in principle, up to 100%; therefore, new classes of promising TADF emitters and modifications of existing ones are sought after. This study explores the TADF emission properties of six designed TADF emitters, examining their photophysical responses using experimental and theoretical methods. The design strategy involves creating six distinct types of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, where tert&#8208;butylcarbazoles are used as donors, while the acceptor component incorporates three different functional groups: nitrile, tetrazole and oxadiazole, with varying electron&#8208;withdrawing character. Additionally, the donor&#8208;acceptor distance is adjusted using a phenylene spacer, and its influence on TADF functionality is examined. The clear dependency of an additional spacer, inhibiting TADF, could be revealed. Emitters with a direct donor&#8208;acceptor connection are demonstrated to exhibit TADF moderate emissive behavior. The analysis emphasizes the impact of charge transfer, singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), and other microscopic parameters on photophysical rates, permitting TADF. Among the emitters, TCz&#8208;CN shows optimal performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter with an 88% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and fast rate of reversible intersystem crossing of 2x106 s&#8208;1</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis.

Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8208;1.33 e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;Benzotriazines through an Iodide&#8208;Catalyzed Skeletal Editing of 3&#8208;Aminoindazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The developed method demonstrates the activation of heteroatoms via electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without using any metal catalysts and peroxides.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This report describes an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3-benzotriazines through an iodide-catalyzed electro-oxidative N-centered [1,2]-rearrangement of 3-aminoindazoles. The developed method demonstrates the activation of heteroatoms via electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without using any metal catalysts and peroxides. The protocol features practical and mild reaction conditions and displays a wide substrate scope. Various mechanistic experiments and cyclic voltammetric studies have been instrumental in elucidating the reaction mechanism, operating via a skeletal rearrangement of 3-aminoindazoles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Photoluminescence (PL) of the [PtII(C&#8201;C)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes are tunable via the modification of ligands, intermolecular interactions and type of molecular aggregation. SC XRD, PL, and DFT unite to discriminate the rare RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons to be responsible for the emission redshift, the RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncomplex synthons being less critical. The plausible continuum of RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt contacts is indicated as the broad space for the PL continuous tuning.







Abstract
Tunable photoluminescence (PL) is one of the hot topics in current materials science, and research performed on the molecular phases is at the forefront of this field. We present the new (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#8901;rez3&#8901;1/3H2O (Pt2rez3) (bph=biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diyl; rez3=3,3&#8221;,5,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8221;&#8208;terphenyl, phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol coformer, a linear quaternary hydrogen bond donor) co&#8208;crystal salt based on the recently appointed promising [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; luminophore. Within the extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded subnetwork [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes and rez3 coformer molecules form two types of contacts: the rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncomplex ones in the equatorial plane of the complex and non&#8208;typical rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt ones along its axial direction. The combined structural, PL, and DFT approach identified the rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons to be crucial in promoting the noticeable uniform redshift of bph ligand centered (LC) emission compared to the LC emission of the (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#8901;H2O (Pt2) precursor, owing to the direct interference of the phenol group with the PtII&#8208;bph orbital system via altering the CT processes within. The high&#8208;resolution emission spectra for Pt2 and Pt2rez3 were successfully reproduced at 77&#8197;K by using the Franck&#8208;Cordon expressions. The possibility to tune PL properties along the plausible continuum of rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons is indicated, considering various scenarios of molecular occupation of the space above and below the complex plane.

         <title>Unusually Short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Contacts in Intramolecularly Cyclized Helically Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helically fused anthracene structure was cyclized through intramolecular Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the dichloro derivative, resulting in a cyclic structure with unusually short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;) within the inner region. This steric environment significantly influences the spectroscopic data and the bonding nature.







Abstract
The intramolecular coupling of dichloro&#8208;substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X&#8208;ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5&#8197;ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44&#8201;%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high&#8208;frequency shift of the C&#8722;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl&#8208;substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light induced decarboxylative alkoxyamination of carboxylic acids with TEMPO is disclosed. In the presence of FeBr2 and TEMPO, a large array of carboxylic acids including marketed drugs and biobased molecules is turned into the corresponding alkoxyamine derivatives. The versatility of the latter offers an entry towards molecular diversity generation from abundant starting materials and catalyst.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iron-catalyzed visible-light driven decarboxylative alkoxyamination is disclosed. In the presence of FeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TEMPO, a large array of carboxylic acids including marketed drugs and biobased molecules is turned into the corresponding alkoxyamine derivatives. The versatility of the latter offers an entry towards molecular diversity generation from abundant starting materials and catalyst. Overall, this method proposes a unified and general approach for LMCT-based iron-catalyzed decarboxylative functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;Sulfenyl Oxazoles from Alkynyl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been accomplished using Br&#248;nsted acid conditions and gold catalysis, respectively. Same excess experiments and natural bond order analysis illuminate the control processes in gold mediated alkynyl thioether reactions. A telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocol affords sulfoxide and sulfone regioisomers.







Abstract
The regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been achieved. Gold&#8208;catalysed conditions are used to favour the formation of 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles via &#946;&#8208;selective attack of the nitrenoid relative to the sulfenyl group. In contrast, 4&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles are formed by &#945;&#8208;selective reaction under Br&#248;nsted acid conditions from the same substrates. The nature of stabilising gold&#8208;sulfur interactions have been investigated by natural bond orbital analysis, showing that the S&#8594;Au interactions are significantly stronger in the intermediate that favours the 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles. A kinetic survey identifies catalyst inhibition processes. This study into the regiodivergent methods includes the development of telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocols for regioselective access to oxazole sulfoxides and sulfones.

         <title>Activation of SO2F2 at a Rhodium PNP Pincer Complex: Ligand Supported S&#8722;F Bond Cleavage to Generate NSO2F Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a PNP rhodium complex with SO2F2 led to the bimetallic rhodium(I) fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2. Reactivity studies with XeF2 resulted in an oxidative addition at the Rh centres to give a Rh(III) fluorido complex.







Abstract
The &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8722;phosphine ligand precursor NH(CH2CH2PCy2)2 can be used for the synthesis of the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NHC2H4PCy2}][Cl] (1). The deprotonated complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NC2H4PCy2}] (2) shows a cooperative reactivity of the PNP ligand in the activation reaction of SO2F2 to yield the rhodium fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (3) by S&#8722;F bond cleavage. It is remarkable that no reaction was observed when 3 was treated with hydrogen sources e.&#8201;g. dihydrogen, organosilicon compounds such as triethylsilane or TMS&#8722;CF3 and different fluorine sources such as SF4 or Selectfluor&#174;. However, the treatment of complex 3 with XeF2 in the presence of CsF resulted in the formation of the unique fluorido rhodium(III) complex cis,trans&#8208;[Rh(F)3(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (4). In the presence of pyridine(HF)X or BF3 the fluorido complex 3 converted into the dicationic complexes [Rh(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2[XF]2, X=HF (5) or BF3 (6), respectively.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Germyl Radical Generation via EDA&#8208;Catalyzed ET&#8211;HAT Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile generation of germyl radical was achieved by using photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using catalytic amounts of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any photocatalyst.







Abstract
We have established a facile and efficient protocol for the generation of germyl radicals by employing photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using a catalytic amount of EDA complex of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds simply upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any transition metal or photocatalyst. This protocol also affords silyl radical from silyl hydride.

         <title>Mixed Tin Valence in the Tin(II/IV)&#8208;Nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel tin nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16 was prepared in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction from Sn3N4 and P3N5. It incorporates tin in mixed oxidation states +II and +IV in a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra. The material was characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Sn3P8N16 combines the structural versatility of nitridophosphates and Sn within one compound. It was synthesized as dark gray powder in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 6&#8197;GPa from Sn3N4 and P3N5. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group C2/m (no. 12), a=12.9664(4), b=10.7886(4), c=4.8238(2) &#197;, &#946;=109.624(1)&#176;) and shows a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra, incorporating Sn in oxidation states +II and +IV. The Sn cations are located within eight&#8208;membered rings of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra, stacked along the [001] direction. A combination of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations was used to confirm the mixed oxidation of Sn. Temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal a low thermal expansion of 3.6&#8197;ppm/K up to 750&#8201;&#176;C, beyond which Sn3P8N16 starts to decompose.

The material was characterized by X-ray diffraction methods, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; combines the structural versatility of nitridophosphates and Sn within one compound. It was synthesized as dark gray powder in a high-pressure high-temperature reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 6&#8197;GPa from Sn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The crystal structure was elucidated from single-crystal diffraction data (space group &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;2/&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; (no. 12), &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=12.9664(4), &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=10.7886(4), &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=4.8238(2) &#197;, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;=109.624(1)&#176;) and shows a 3D-network of PN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, incorporating Sn in oxidation states +II and +IV. The Sn cations are located within eight-membered rings of vertex-sharing PN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, stacked along the [001] direction. A combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, &lt;sup&gt;119&lt;/sup&gt;Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations was used to confirm the mixed oxidation of Sn. Temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a low thermal expansion of 3.6&#8197;ppm/K up to 750&#8201;&#176;C, beyond which Sn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; starts to decompose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of ADP&#8208;Ribose and Dinucleoside Di&#8208;/Triphosphate Derivatives via P(V)&#8208;P(V) Coupling Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and reproducible method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction is reported. By developing a hydrolysis&#8208;stable ImIm&#8208;Cl analog for phosphate activation, this P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction can be used to successfully synthesize biological important ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules. This method allows for pyrophosphate formation on peptides for the first time to synthesize ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.







Abstract
Biomolecules containing adenosine di&#8208; or triphosphate (ADP or ATP) are crucial for diverse biological processes. Synthesis of these biomolecules and development of their chemical probes are important to elucidate their functions. Enabling reproducible and high&#8208;yielding access to these ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules via conventional P(III)&#8208;P(V) and P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reactions is challenging owing to water content in highly polar phosphate&#8208;containing substrates. Herein, we report an efficient and reliable method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction through in&#8197;situ activation of phosphates using hydrolysis&#8208;stable 2&#8208;[N&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazoyl)]&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (2&#8208;MeImIm&#8208;Cl), providing the corresponding electrophilic P(V) intermediates for subsequent nucleophilic attack using their coupling partners. This P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction proceeded even in a wet reaction medium and showed a broad substrate scope, accommodating protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of ADP&#8208;ribose and nicotinamide adenine diphosphate analogs, ATP&#8208;containing biomolecules, and ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.

         <title>Dual Role of a Novel Heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu(I) complex based on a benzoquinoxalinone derivative was used in visible&#8208;light driven CO2 reduction. The ability to accumulate charges on the non&#8208;innocent ligand not only enables its role as an excellent photosensitizer, in combination with a an Fe(III) porphyrin, but brings this complex to the next level, as it acts as photocatalyst, achieving selectively the reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475&#8197;nm (&#1013; =4500&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Phosphorescent Emission Modulated by Clipping of Metallotweezers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorent nanoparticles with enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission were obtaiend by non&#8208;covalent clipping strategy. This approach offers a convenient and effecient pathway toward luminescent materials with specialized functions.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials have received significant attention due to their potential applications in bioimaging and diagnostics. Although, many types of organic phosphors with near&#8208;infrared emission have been developed, the low phosphorescence efficiency in aqueous solution hampers their practical applications in biological systems. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials with high emission efficiency in aqueous media. Metallotweezers, based on d8 transition metal complexes, emerge as the potential candidates for realizing this objective. Specifically, metallotweezers, featuring two positively charged platinum(II) terpyridine and neutral gold(III) diphenylpyridine pincers on diphenylpyridine spacer, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. The pre&#8208;organization effect, rendered by the rigid spacer, enables the resulting metallotweezers to complex with each other, resulting in the formation of clipping complex. The synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects of clipping structure results in enhanced phosphorescent emission intensity. Concurrently, due to phase segregation between the clipping units and the polyethylene glycol tail, the clipping complex undergoes self&#8208;assembly in aqueous solution, resulting in phosphorescent emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Overall, non&#8208;covalent clipping of metallotweezers illustrated in this study presents a new and effective approach toward near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Supramolecular Sequential Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems for Constructing White LED Device and Latent Fingerprint Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arenes, using WP5&#11815;G as the energy donor and commercially available dyes DBT (acceptor I) and SR101 (acceptor II) as the energy acceptor, a supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting system with sequential energy transfer was successfully constructed. Significantly, this system shows attractive applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices and latent fingerprint (LFP) imaging.







Abstract
The fabrication of supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interaction in water and its applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging. The host&#8208;guest complex WP5

G self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles in water and shows enhanced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The nanoparticles can be further used to construct sequential LHS with fluorescent dyes 4,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DBT) and sulforhodamine 101 (SR101). Impressively, the system shows white&#8208;light emission when the molar ratio of WP5

G/DBT/SR101 is 1100/2/16. The material can be coated on a LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit multicolor fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high&#8208;resolution imaging of latent fingerprints. Therefore, we demonstrated a general strategy for the construction of sequential LHS in water based on macrocyclic host&#8208;guest interaction and explored its multi&#8208;functional applications in white&#8208;light LED device and imaging of latent fingerprints, which will promote future development and application of supramolecular LHSs.

In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit multicolor fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high-resolution imaging of latent fingerprints. Therefore, we demonstrated a general strategy for the construction of sequential LHS in water based on macrocyclic host-guest interaction and explored its multi-functional applications in white-light LED device and imaging of latent fingerprints, which will promote future development and application of supramolecular LHSs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Control of Polyproline II Helix Stability via the Identity of Acyl Capping Groups: the Pivaloyl Group Particularly Promotes PPII</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyproline II helix (PPII) is stabilized by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. The ability to tune PPII structure in water via changes in the electronic properties of the acyl capping group is demonstrated herein. More electron&#8208;rich acyl capping groups promote PPII, both at proline and non&#8208;proline residues, via stronger n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. In contrast, more electron&#8208;poor groups exhibit lower PPII.







Abstract
The type II polyproline helix (PPII) is a fundamental secondary structure of proteins, important in globular proteins, in intrinsically disordered proteins, and at protein&#8208;protein interfaces. PPII is stabilized in part by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron&#8208;donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron&#8208;acceptor carbonyl (&#960;*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n&#8594;&#960;* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X&#8722;PPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides (X=10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron&#8208;rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac&#8722;) group, with the pivaloyl and iso&#8208;butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X&#8722;APPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non&#8208;proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII. The effects of acyl capping groups were further analyzed in X&#8211;DfpPGY&#8208;NH2 and X&#8722;ADfpPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, Dfp=4,4&#8208;difluoroproline. Data on these peptides indicated that acyl groups induced order Piv&#8208; &gt; Ac&#8208; &gt; For&#8208;. These results suggest that greater consideration should be given to the identity of acyl capping groups in inducing structure in peptides.

         <title>Covalently Linked 5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene Dimer and Its Triptycene&#8208;Capped Derivatives as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triptycene end&#8208;capped bi&#8208;tetraazaacene (bi&#8208;TpTANC) was synthesised with good solubility, rigidity, and crystallinity, and was characterised using X&#8208;ray crystallography. Bi&#8208;TpTANC is a multi&#8208;electron acceptor with a 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, and its electrochemistry suggests through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in its monoanionic state. With a LUMO level of &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, bi&#8208;TpTANC is expected to be an air stable electron acceptor or an n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
The development of electron transport and n&#8208;type materials is still largely dominated by a limited number of organic semiconductors, with fullerenes at the forefront. In contrast, substantial progress has been made in developing hole transport and p&#8208;type materials. Therefore, expanding the range of electron acceptors, making them solution&#8208;processable, and elucidating their structural arrangement by X&#8208;ray crystallography is essential. We synthesised 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;(5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TANC) and its triptycene end&#8208;capped derivative, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bi(8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8,13&#8208;[1,2]benzenonaphtho&#8208;5,6,15,16&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TpTANC), as electron acceptors. Bi&#8208;TANC exhibits a herringbone&#8208;like crystal packing with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, which is observed in typical organic n&#8208;type semiconductors. However, it showed poor solubility, similar to larger acenes. In contrast, bi&#8208;TpTANC exhibited favourable solubility, and its electrochemistry in solution was investigated. In the cyclic voltammogram of bi&#8208;TpTANC, reversible redox waves corresponding to 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer were observed at &#8722;0.795&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), &#8722;0.927&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), and &#8722;1.44&#8197;V (2e&#8722;) as half&#8208;wave potentials. The redox wave associated with the two&#8208;electron transfer on the negative low&#8208;potential side indicates the presence of through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in the monoanionic state. Furthermore, the LUMO level of bi&#8208;TpTANC is &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, which indicates its potential as a promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type material.

         <title>Low&#8208;lying LUMO Boosts Conductance in Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalene Versus Aromatic Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzopentalene paired with pyridyl anchor groups is shown to conduct better than aromatic analogues containing phenyl or anthracene inside single&#8208;molecule junctions. Compared to thioanisole anchors, pyridyls provide better molecular orbital level&#8208;Fermi level alignment. The result is a significant conductance&#8208;voltage response especially for a sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm long molecule. The conductance increases nearly ten&#8208;fold over a 1.5&#8197;V range.







Abstract
Antiaromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, but the study of molecular wires incorporating antiaromatic units is limited. Despite initial predictions, very few studies show that antiaromaticity has a beneficial effect on electron transport. Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a stable structure that displays appreciable antiaromaticity within the five&#8208;membered rings of the pentalene core. We have investigated derivatives of DBP furnished with pyridyl (Py) and F4&#8208;pyridyl (PyF4) anchor groups, and compared the conductance with purely aromatic phenyl and anthracene analogues. We find that the low&#8208;bias conductance of DBP&#8208;Py is approximately 60&#8201;% larger than that of the anthracene analogue Anth&#8208;Py and 250&#8201;% larger compared to the phenyl derivative Ph&#8208;Py. This is due to a better alignment of the LUMO with the gold Fermi level, which we confirm by conductance&#8208;voltage spectroscopy where the conductance of DBP&#8208;Py shows the greatest voltage&#8208;dependence. The F4&#8208;pyridyl compounds, which have lower LUMO energies compared to the pyridyl analogues, did not, however, form detectable molecular junctions. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the donor capability of the nitrogen lone&#8208;pair to the point where stable N&#8722;Au bonds no longer form.

     alt="Low-lying LUMO Boosts Conductance in Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalene Versus Aromatic Analogues"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibenzopentalene paired with pyridyl anchor groups is shown to conduct better than aromatic analogues containing phenyl or anthracene inside single-molecule junctions. Compared to thioanisole anchors, pyridyls provide better molecular orbital level-Fermi level alignment. The result is a significant conductance-voltage response especially for a sub-2&#8197;nm long molecule. The conductance increases nearly ten-fold over a 1.5&#8197;V range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiaromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, but the study of molecular wires incorporating antiaromatic units is limited. Despite initial predictions, very few studies show that antiaromaticity has a beneficial effect on electron transport. Dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]pentalene (DBP) is a stable structure that displays appreciable antiaromaticity within the five-membered rings of the pentalene core. We have investigated derivatives of DBP furnished with pyridyl (Py) and F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyridyl (PyF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) anchor groups, and compared the conductance with purely aromatic phenyl and anthracene analogues. We find that the low-bias conductance of &lt;b&gt;DBP-Py&lt;/b&gt; is approximately 60&#8201;% larger than that of the anthracene analogue &lt;b&gt;Anth-Py&lt;/b&gt; and 250&#8201;% larger compared to the phenyl derivative &lt;b&gt;Ph-Py&lt;/b&gt;. This is due to a better alignment of the LUMO with the gold Fermi level, which we confirm by conductance-voltage spectroscopy where the conductance of &lt;b&gt;DBP-Py&lt;/b&gt; shows the greatest voltage-dependence. The F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pyridyl compounds, which have lower LUMO energies compared to the pyridyl analogues, did not, however, form detectable molecular junctions. The strongly electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the donor capability of the nitrogen lone-pair to the point where stable N&#8722;Au bonds no longer form.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>UoC&#8208;7: A Bimetallic K&#8208;Zn&#8208;MOF with an Anionic Framework Based on Fluorinated Trimesate Ligands Exhibiting a Large CO2 Uptake</title>

The MOFs UoC&#8208;7(1F) and UoC&#8208;7(2F) (UoC: University of Cologne) with an anionic framework based on potassium and zinc cations and fluorinated trimesate linkers show an almost unprecedented high CO2 uptake at 1&#8197;bar, which increases significantly with an increasing number of fluorine substituents.







Abstract
In solvothermal reactions of Zn(NO3)2&#215;6H2O with K(H2mF&#8208;BTC) or K(H2dF&#8208;BTC) in DMF/ethanol or DMA/ethanol solvent mixtures, single crystals of the MOFs UoC&#8208;7(1F) and UoC&#8208;7(2F) were obtained crystallizing in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.&#160;176) (H3BTC: 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid; mF&#8208;/dF: mono&#8208;/difluoro; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; DMA: N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide; UoC: University of Cologne). According to the general composition [(CH3)2NH2][K2Zn3(mF&#8208;/dF&#8208;BTC)3(H2O)]&#215;solvent, UoC&#8208;7 consists of an anionic bimetallic framework. The charge is compensated by a (CH3)2NH2+ cation stemming from the (partial) hydrolysis of the solvent. The crystal structure shows large channels along the hexagonal [001] direction, which accommodate the cations as well as solvent molecules. Surface areas (SBET) of 2740&#8197;m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(1F)) and 1643&#8197;m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(2F)) were obtained from N2 sorption measurements. UoC&#8208;7 shows structural similarities to the MOF NKU&#8208;521 with a 5&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)isophthalate linker. Both MOFs exhibit a 4,7,8T14 topology. Despite smaller channels in UoC&#8208;7 compared to NKU&#8208;521, the CO2 uptake is considerably higher (~164&#8197;cm3/g at 1&#8197;bar/293&#8197;K) being one of the highest CO2 uptakes observed up to now.
