         <title>Thiophosphinoyl&#8208;Tethered Ylide&#8208;Substituted Heavier Carbenes: Synthesis, Structures and Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and structure analysis of a series of mono and diylide&#8208;substituted tetrylenes of type YEX and Y2E (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; X = Cl or Br) using a thiophosphinoyl&#8208;tethered metallated ylide (Y = Ph2P(S)&#8208;C&#8208;P(pip)Ph2 with pip = piperidyl) is reported, amongst the first ylide&#8208;substituted plumbylenes. The tetrylenes feature distinct trends in the spectroscopic and structural properties of the ylide ligand with increasing atomic number of the tetrel element. For instance, an increasingly high&#8208;field shifted signal for the phosphonium group is observed in the 31P&#8208;NMR spectrum as a consequence of the increasing polarity of the element&#8208;carbon bond, which likewise results in a shortening of the ylidic C&#8208;P bond in the solid&#8208;state structure. The diylidyltetrylenes are unstable towards transylidation forming the mono(ylide)tetrylenes when treated with the tetrel dihalides according to the stability trend: Y2Pb &lt; Y2Sn &lt; Y2Ge &lt; YPbBr &lt; YSnCl &lt; YGeCl. Starting from the monoylide&#8208;substituted chlorotertrylenes the first unsymmetrical diylidyltetrylenes of type YEY&#8217; can be accessed, whose solid&#8208;state structures revealed that not the C&#8208;E but the S&#8208;E bond to the thiophosphinoyl group is most affected by the second ylide substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution of CrOx/Rh Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) coated with an ultrathin layer of Cr&#8208;oxides (CrOx) was investigated as a model electrode for the Cr2O3/Rh&#8208;metal core&#8208;shell&#8208;type cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. The CrOx layer was electrodeposited over RhNP on a transparent conductive fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The CrOx layer on RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process at the CrOx/RhNP interface, leading to the increased current density for the HER. Impedance spectroscopic analysis revealed that the CrOx layer transferred protons via the hopping mechanism to the RhNP surface for HER. In addition, CrOx restricted electron transfer from the FTO to the electrolyte and/or RhNP and suppressed the backward reaction by limiting oxygen migration. This study clarifies the crucial role of the ultrathin CrOx layer on nanoparticulate cocatalysts and provides a cocatalyst design strategy for realizing efficient photocatalytic water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. Here we report the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ in the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties show intriguing halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon alternative treatments by trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine, the absorption and the fluorescence can be reversibly switched. It is revealed that the introduced proton is on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring.







Abstract
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110&#8197;nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Tantalum Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the tantalum cluster cations catalyze: The cationic tantalum atom and the cationic tetramer exhibit a strong size&#8208;dependent reactivity with methane and carbon dioxide: The monomer yields products from C&#8722;C coupling reactions, while the tetramer enables the formation of formaldehyde or syngas.







Abstract
Understanding molecular&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms is crucial for the design of modern catalysts with industrial prospect. Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH4 and CO2, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta1,4+ ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH4 dehydrogenation [Ta1,4CH2]+ to CO2 in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8722;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH2O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8722;C coupling yielding CH2CO. Selected experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta1,4+ compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x (x&#8776;0.9) is a crystalline compound suitable as model compound for the understanding of structural traits within amorphous LiPON materials. A plethora of analytical methods, including diffraction methods, NMR, vibration spectroscopy and elemental analyses, was employed for elucidation of structure and composition of this substance. Ionic conductivity was measured using impedance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Non&#8208;crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate (LiPON) is used as solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphates are important model structures to retrieve analytical information that can be used to understand amorphous phases better. The new crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x was synthesized as an off&#8208;white powder by ampoule synthesis at 750&#8211;800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c with a=15.13087(11)&#8197;&#197;, b=9.70682(9)&#8197;&#197;, c=8.88681(7)&#8197;&#197;, and &#946;=106.8653(8)&#176;. Two P(O,N)4 tetrahedra connected by an N atom form the structural motif [P2O6&#8722;xN1+x](5+x)&#8722;. The structure was elucidated from X&#8208;ray diffraction data and the model corroborated by NMR and infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analyses. Measurements of ionic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.8&#215;10&#8722;7&#8201;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C with an activation energy of 0.52&#177;0.01&#8197;eV.

Finding out the angles: Flow chemistry using microreactors makes it possible to obtain 5&#8208;diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, which cannot be synthesized in batch processes. The observation of equilibrium processes under 1&#8197;min is feasible by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which also reveals that a slight change in the angle of the constituent molecule affects the dynamic equilibrium in solution and crystal structure.







Abstract
5&#8208;Diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (1), which is inaccessible by conventional batch methods, was synthesized by using a flow microreactor. Compound 1 was obtained as an equilibrium mixture of a cyclic trimer and a cyclic tetramer in solution, the latter of which was crystallized in benzene by vapor diffusion of hexane at 7&#8201;&#176;C. The dynamic nature of this system was confirmed by solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent experiments. Notably, the dynamics was verified by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the time required to reach equilibrium was influenced by the solvent ratio (&lt;18&#8197;s, 24&#8211;28&#8197;s, and 34&#8211;42&#8197;s in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixtures of [D6]acetone and C6D6, respectively). Compound 1 and 3&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine (2) exhibited different self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution and crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggested that this difference was largely due to enhanced planarity between two consecutive aromatic rings.

         <title>Probing the Importance of Host Symmetry on Carbohydrate Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple switch from formic acid to HFIP allows the formation of the C3 symmetrical hemicryptophane cage analogue of the previously reported C1 symmetrical one. The cage with low symmetry exhibits higher binding constants towards carbohydrates than the C3 analogue. The receptors showed remarkable high substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity towards &#945;&#8208;glucoside and &#946;&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
The design of molecular cages with low symmetry could allow for more specific tuning of their properties and better mimic the unsymmetrical and complex environment of protein pockets. However, the added value of lowering symmetry of molecular receptors has been rarely demonstrated. Herein, C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;symmetrical cages, presenting the same recognition sites, have been synthesized and investigated as hosts for carbohydrate recognition. Structurally related derivatives of glucose, galactose and mannose were found to have greater affinity to the receptor with the lowest symmetry than to their C3&#8208;symmetrical analogue. According to the host cavity modelling, the C1 symmetry receptor exhibits a wider opening than its C3&#8208;symmetrical counterpart, providing easier access and thus promoting guest proximity to binding sites. Moreover, our results show the high stereo&#8208; and substrate selectivity of the C1 symmetry cage with respect to its C3 counterpart in the recognition of sugars.

         <title>A Simple Substitution on Thyroid Hormones Remarkably Alters the Regioselectivity of Deiodination by a Deiodinase Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) plays key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. This chemical model study reveals that the modulation of the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in T4 through the phenolic group has a remarkable influence on the regioselectivity of the deiodination.







Abstract
The regioselective deiodinations of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4&#8242;&#8208;phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal of all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8722;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4&#8208;imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.

This chemical model study reveals that the modulation of the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in T4 through the phenolic group has a remarkable influence on the regioselectivity of the deiodination.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;- or 5-deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;- or 5-deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4&#8242;-phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal of all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8722;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4-imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interplay Between Hydrogen Bonding and Electron Transfer in Mixed Valence Assemblies of Triarylamine Trisamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not only hydrogen bonds but also a specific packing arrangement are necessary to get fast electron transfer in mixed valence assemblies of triarylamine trisamides. Defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long&#8208;range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3&#8208;symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#8722;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FTIR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8901;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen&#8208;bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293&#8197;K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with a Binuclear Bis&#8208;Terpyridine Pyrazole&#8208;Bridged Cobalt Complex
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a binuclear cobalt complex stabilized by a new pyrazole&#8208;based ligand platform substituted with terpyridine groups. The dicobalt complex is electrocatalytically active towards carbon monoxide formation, from carbon dioxide in the presence of Bronsted acids. The terpyridine fragments participate during the electrocatalysis, reducing the overpotential of the reduction reaction.







Abstract
A pyrazole&#8208;based ligand substituted with terpyridine groups at the 3 and 5 positions has been synthesized to form the dinuclear cobalt complex 1, that electrocatalytically reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids in DMF. Chemical, electrochemical and UV&#8208;vis spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under inert atmosphere indicate pairwise reduction processes of complex 1. Infrared spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under CO2 and CO atmosphere are consistent with a reduced CO&#8208;containing dicobalt complex which results from the electroreduction of CO2. In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), electrocatalytic studies revealed single&#8208;site mechanism with up to 94&#8201;% selectivity towards CO formation when 1.47&#8197;M TFE were present, at &#8722;1.35&#8197;V vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode in DMF (0.39&#8197;V overpotential). The low faradaic efficiencies obtained (&lt;50&#8201;%) are attributed to the generation of CO&#8208;containing species formed during the electrocatalytic process, which inhibit the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Carbene Transfer to Isocyanides as a Platform for Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The readily available low&#8208;valent iron complex [Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722; catalyzes the efficient transfer of carbenes to isocyanides. The resulting ketenimines undergo in&#8197;situ cyclocondensation with various bisnucleophiles to give a broad range of medicinally relevant heterocycles. A plausible mechanism for the carbene transfer is proposed based on DFT calculations.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalysed carbene transfer reaction of diazo compounds to isocyanides has been developed. The resulting ketenimines are trapped in&#8197;situ with various bisnucleophiles to access a range of densely functionalized heterocycles (pyrimidinones, dihydropyrazolones, 1H&#8208;tetrazoles) in a one&#8208;pot process. The electron&#8208;rich Hieber anion ([Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722;) facilitates efficient catalytic carbene transfer from acceptor&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds to isocyanides, providing a cost&#8208;efficient and benign alternative to similar noble metal&#8208;catalysed processes. Based on DFT calculations a plausible reaction mechanism for activation of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl carbene precursor and ketenimine formation is provided.

Just add water: Self&#8208;assembled intermediates were thoroughly modulated from an minimal model phenylalanine&#8208;based derivative (LPFM) featuring a C2 structure with single l&#8208;Phe conjugated on para&#8208;benzene. By altering the ratio of ethanol/H2O co&#8208;solvents, a dynamic morphological evolution of nanofibers from right&#8208; to left&#8208;handedness was successively revealed. The left&#8208;handed nanostructures were found to be favorable for cell adhesion and proliferation.







Abstract
Being able to precisely manipulate both the morphology and chiroptical signals of supramolecular assemblies will help to better understand the natural biological self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Two simple l/d&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;based derivatives (L/DPFM) have been designed, and their solvent&#8208;dependent morphology evolutions are illustrated. It was found that, as the content of H2O in aqueous ethanol solutions was increased, LPFM self&#8208;assembles first into right&#8208;handed nanofibers, then flat fibrous structures, and finally inversed left&#8208;handed nanofibers. Assemblies in ethanol and H2O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology&#8208;dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left&#8208;handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for cell adhesion than right&#8208;handed nanostructures. Quantitative AFM analysis showed that the L929&#8197;cell adhesion force on left&#8208;handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Moreover, the value of cell Young's modulus is lower for left&#8208;handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell&#8208;substrate interactions might lead to different effects on cell behavior.

         <title>Di&#8208;Iron(II) [2+2] Helicates of Bis&#8208;(Dipyrazolylpyridine) Ligands: The Influence of the Ligand Linker Group on Spin State Properties</title>

This diiron(II) complex has been crystallized in three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of the butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl ligand linker groups. The crystals exhibit a range of spin state properties, including stepwise spin&#8208;crossover of the two iron atoms. A related ligand with a rigid pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl spacer forms more a distorted, high&#8208;spin diiron(II) helicate structure.







Abstract
Four bis[2&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}&#8208;6&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl}pyridine] ligands have been synthesized, with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl (L1), pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl (L2), benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylenyl (L3) and propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl (L4) linkers between the tridentate metal&#8208;binding domains. L1 and L2 form [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L)2]X4 (X&#8722;=BF4&#8722; or ClO4&#8722;) helicate complexes when treated with the appropriate iron(II) precursor. Solvate crystals of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2][BF4]4 exhibit three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of their butanediyl linker groups. The solvates exhibit gradual thermal spin&#8208;crossover, with examples of stepwise switching and partial spin&#8208;crossover to a low&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;spin form. Salts of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L2)2]4+ are high&#8208;spin, which reflects their highly twisted iron coordination geometry. The composition and dynamics of assembly structures formed by iron(II) with L1&#8722;L3 vary with the ligand linker group, by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations imply the butanediyl linker conformation in [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2]4+ influences its spin state properties, but show anomalies attributed to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the iron atoms.

         <title>Towards Luminescent Vanadium(II) Complexes with Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Quantum Coherence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>

Towards qubits with optical read&#8208;out: Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (4MLCT) states account for the color of the vanadium(II) complex isomers cis&#8208;fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[V(ddpd)2]2+ in spite of the electron&#8208;rich pyridines. 2MLCT states mix with the lowest spin&#8208;flip states, contracting the V&#8722;N bonds in the excited state and preventing ruby&#8208;like spin&#8208;flip emission. Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K.The mer isomer shows slow magnetic relaxation in an external magnetic field. These results pave the way for qubits with optical read&#8208;out based on vanadium(II) complexes.







Abstract
Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35&#8197;GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400&#8197;mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.

Organic photoreactions &#8220;on water&#8221;, namely in aqueous suspension or emulsion, are significantly accelerated in this ecologically favorable medium.







Abstract
Two representative organic photoreactions, namely a bimolecular photocycloaddition and a monomolecular photorearrangement, are presented that are accelerated when the reaction is performed &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, that is, at the water&#8208;substrate interface with no solvation of the reaction components. According to the established models of ground&#8208;state reactions &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, the enhanced efficiency of the photoreactions is explained by hydrophobic effects (Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction) or specific hydrogen bonding (di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement) at the water&#8208;substrate interface that decrease the energy of the respective transition state. These results point to the potential of this approach to conduct photoreactions more efficiently in an ecologically favorable medium.

         <title>Dichromic Allophycocyanin Trimer Covering a Broad Spectral Range (550&#8211;660&#8197;nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
When exploring the role of chromophores in phycobilisome assembly, a novel dichromic allophycocyanin was obtained that greatly extends the spectral range for light&#8208;harvesting. A linker contained in the structure is successfully used for template&#8208;assisted assembly in&#8197;vitro. This approach would also allow for targeting, in artificial photosynthetic systems or fluorescence labeling.







Abstract
Phycobilisomes, the light&#8208;harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex superstructure and assembly have been an obstacle. By replacing in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green&#8208;absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red&#8208;absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic&#8208;APC) was obtained. In the small (110&#8197;kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660&#8197;nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting element. Dic&#8208;APC was generated in&#8197;vitro by using the contained core&#8208;linker, LC, for template&#8208;assisted purification and assembly.

     alt="Dichromic Allophycocyanin Trimer Covering a Broad Spectral Range (550&#8211;660&#8197;nm)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When exploring the role of chromophores in phycobilisome assembly, a novel dichromic allophycocyanin was obtained that greatly extends the spectral range for light-harvesting. A linker contained in the structure is successfully used for template-assisted assembly in&#8197;vitro. This approach would also allow for targeting, in artificial photosynthetic systems or fluorescence labeling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phycobilisomes, the light-harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex superstructure and assembly have been an obstacle. By replacing in &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green-absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red-absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic-APC) was obtained. In the small (110&#8197;kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660&#8197;nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light-harvesting element. Dic-APC was generated in&#8197;vitro by using the contained core-linker, L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, for template-assisted purification and assembly. Labeling the linker provides a method for targeting Dic-APC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oleyl ligands are known as good dispersants for stabilizing nanoparticles in less&#8208;polar solvents; however, the structure&#8208;dispersibility relationships remain unclear. We synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the relationship and reveal that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors to enhance dispersibility.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) are inherently prone to aggregation and loss of their size&#8208;derived properties, thus it is essential to enhance their dispersibility for applications. In less polar solvents, organic ligands containing oleyl groups are known as good dispersants due to their inefficient shell packing and inhibition of chain&#8211;chain crystallization as well as interdigitation between adjacent NPs. However, reagents with oleyl structures, such as oleic acid and oleylamine, can contain trans double bonds and saturated impurities, which might affect the chemical and/or physical properties of the NPs. Nevertheless, the effect of slight differences in surface ligand structure, including isomers, on the dispersibility of NPs has been little studied. We have synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the structure&#8211;dispersibility relationship in detail. Dynamic light scattering and visible light transmittance revealed that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors in enhancing dispersibility.

         <title>Conformationally Restricted &#946;&#8208;Sheet Breaker Peptides Incorporating Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Methylisoserine Sulfamidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a cyclic sulfamidate moiety as a &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker element is proposed for the first time. The sulfamidate effectively locks the peptide secondary structure in a novel rigid turn both in the gas phase and solid state, which is also maintained in solution. Peptides bearing this motif show moderate amyloid&#8208;&#946; inhibition activity.







Abstract
Peptides containing variations of the &#946;&#8208;amyloid hydrophobic core and five&#8208;membered sulfamidates derived from &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#945;&#8208;methylisoserine have been synthesized and fully characterized in the gas phase, solid state and in aqueous solution by a combination of experimental and computational techniques. The cyclic sulfamidate group effectively locks the secondary structure at the N&#8208;terminus of such hybrid peptides imposing a conformational restriction and stabilizing non&#8208;extended structures. This conformational bias, which is maintained in the gas phase, solid state and aqueous solution, is shown to be resistant to structure templating through assays of in&#8197;vitro &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation, acting as &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker peptides with moderate activity.

Base&#8208;stabilized neutral oxoborane and thioxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand have been synthesized and structurally characterized. While previous synthetic attempts of oxoborane ligated by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (NacNac) did not allow for its isolation in acid&#8208;free form, oxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand is isolable, due to the absence of imine &#593;&#8208;protons and steric protection of enamine carbon. The utility of bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand suggests further applications of the scaffold as a synthetically viable yet chemically inert substitute of the prototypical NacNac ligands.

Crystallographic analysis revealed the presence of a B&#8722;O double bond close to the shortest end of the reported lengths. Its reactivity has also been examined, and it was majorly governed by the nucleophilicity and basicity of the oxygen atom. The chemical inertness and synthetic convenience of the bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide scaffold presented in this work suggest its utility as an innocent alternative to the NacNac scaffold.

         <title>Homogeneous Dearomative Hydrogenation with a Co/P4N2 Catalyst: A Nucleophilic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes in a nucleophilic manner. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arenes.







Abstract
Arene hydrogenation is the most straightforward method to prepare carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. However, the high resonance energy prevents aromatic substrates from hydrogenation. Herein the homogeneous, nucleophilic hydrogenation of less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes is reported. The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to the cyano (hetero)arene substrates. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the catalytically active CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arene substrates. An outlook for the synthesis of more challenging substituted benzenes was proposed based on the in&#8197;silico modification of the CoH species.

         <title>Unveiling the Collaborative Effect at the Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;MoS2 Hybrid Interface for Electrochemical Melatonin Determination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption geometry of cucurbit[8]uril on a 2D nanoplatform controls the recognition capabilities. It behaves like a traffic light: on a transition metal dichalcogenide, the reception portals of CB[8] are open and the guest molecule can fit in. On graphene (or carbonaceous termination) they are closed, which prevents complex formation.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest interactions are of paramount importance in supramolecular chemistry and in a wide range of applications. Particularly well known is the ability of cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) to selectively host small molecules. We show that the charge transfer and complexation capabilities of CB[n] are retained on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), allowing the development of efficient electrochemical sensing platforms. We unveil the mechanisms of host&#8208;guest recognition between the MoS2&#8208;CB[8] hybrid interface and melatonin (MLT), an important molecular regulator of vital constants in vertebrates. We find that CB[8] on MoS2 organizes the receptor portals perpendicularly to the surface, facilitating MLT complexation. This advantageous adsorption geometry is specific to TMDs and favours MLT electro&#8208;oxidation, as opposed to other 2D platforms like graphene, where one receptor portal is closed. This study rationalises the cooperative interaction in 2D hybrid systems to improve the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical sensing platforms.

         <title>Organometallic Platinum(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been explored to finely tune the electronic properties of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. The complexes were successfully applied as photosensitisers in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion experiments, demonstrating tuneable upconversion quantum yields of up to 14&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for platinum(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (in which C^N=cyclometalating ligand; acac=acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2)&#8197;&#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm (&#1013; &#8776;5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and orange red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em=603&#8211;620&#8197;nm; &#934;em &#8804;37&#8201;%), which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed by microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57&#8201;%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&#934;UC 5.9&#8211;14.1&#8201;%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.

         <title>Structural and Functional Insight into the Mechanism of the Fe&#8722;S Cluster&#8208;Dependent Dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;S cluster&#8208;dependent dehydratases (DHTs) from the ilvD/EDD superfamily play an central role in enzyme cascades for the biomanufacture of the platform chemical isobutanol. Here, functional data for the DHT from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus have provided unprecedented insight into the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes that may inform bioengineering approaches to optimise the cascade.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades play an increasingly important role for the sustainable manufacture of diverse chemicals from renewable feedstocks. For instance, dehydratases from the ilvD/EDD superfamily have been embedded into a cascade to convert glucose via pyruvate to isobutanol, a platform chemical for the production of aviation fuels and other valuable materials. These dehydratases depend on the presence of both a Fe&#8722;S cluster and a divalent metal ion for their function. However, they also represent the rate&#8208;limiting step in the cascade. Here, catalytic parameters and the crystal structure of the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT, both in presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+) were investigated. Rate measurements demonstrate that the presence of stoichiometric concentrations Mn2+ promotes higher activity than Mg2+, but at high concentrations the former inhibits the activity of PuDHT. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the position of a second binding site for the divalent metal ion. Only binding of Mn2+ (not Mg2+) to this site affects the ligand environment of the catalytically essential divalent metal binding site, thus providing insight into an inhibitory mechanism of Mn2+ at higher concentrations. Furthermore, in silico docking identified residues that play a role in determining substrate binding and selectivity. The combined data inform engineering approaches to design an optimal dehydratase for the cascade.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds Bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>

Electronic tuning of ground&#8208;state structures for tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species has been achieved by changing electronic properties of the equatorial aryl groups on the central carbon, confirmed by a correlation between Hammett para&#8208;substituent constant and solid&#8208;state structures of a series of cationic species based on a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7 tricyclic framework.







Abstract
To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton with sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of para substituents (R=Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe) of the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R=H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208; and methyl&#8208;derivatives were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the p&#8208;MeO and thioxanthenyl system were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8722;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These findings amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence of the hypervalent apical 3c&#8211;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.

         <title>Molecular Rotational Correlation Times and Nanoviscosity Determined by 111mCd Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) of &#947;&#8208;rays Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brownian molecular tumbling rates in solution have been measured by using 111mCd perturbed angular correlation of &#947;&#8208;rays (PAC) spectroscopy and a de novo designed molecular probe (a trimeric coiled&#8208;coil protein). Most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays, and PAC spectroscopy might find applications where conventional methods probing rotational correlation times, for example, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, cannot be applied&#8212;from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.







Abstract
The nanoviscosity experienced by molecules in solution may be determined through measurement of the molecular rotational correlation time, &#964;c, for example, by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. With this work, we apply PAC spectroscopy to determine the rate of rotational diffusion, &#955;=1/&#964;c, of a de novo designed protein, TRIL12AL16C, in solutions with viscosities, &#958;, from 1.7 to 88&#8197;mPa&#8901;s. TRIL12AL16C was selected as molecular probe because it exhibits minimal effects due to intramolecular dynamics and static line broadening, allowing for exclusive elucidation of molecular rotational diffusion. Diffusion rates determined by PAC data agree well with literature data from fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, and scales linearly with 1/&#958; in agreement with the Stokes&#8211;Einstein&#8211;Debye model. PAC experiments require only trace amounts (&#8764;1011) of probe nuclei and can be conducted over a broad range of sample temperatures and pressures. Moreover, most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays. Thus, PAC spectroscopy could find applications under circumstances where conventional techniques cannot be applied, spanning from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.

         <title>Photoinduced Dehydrogenative Borylation via Dihydrogen Bond Bridged Electron Donor and Acceptor Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptors for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes bridged by a dihydrogen bond. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex SET to give a boron&#8208;centered radical with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator for effective pyridine borylation.







Abstract
Air&#8208;stable amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptor for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest a dihydrogen bond bridging the donor and acceptor. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex single electron transfer to give a boron&#8208;centered radical for dehydrogenative borylation with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator. The deprotonation of Wheland&#8208;like radical intermediate rather than its generation is believed to determine the good ortho&#8208;selectivity based on DFT calculations. A variety of &#945;&#8208;borylated pyridine derivatives have been readily synthesized with good functional group tolerance.

Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy toward addressing global warming. This review summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR and, it is hoped, will help to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts. For more details, see the Review by Y. Negishi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203387).

The photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. The Review by Y. Negishi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203387) summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. This review could serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>Cover Feature: Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures (Chem. Eur. J. 9/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover feature shows a schematic impression of our study on the dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in less polar solvents. For ligand tail structures, there is a huge gap between saturated stearyl groups (depicted as waxes) and unsaturated oleyl groups (depicted as olives), even though there is very little difference in their molecular structures. In this study, we have synthesized two different ligands to bridge shores that are close yet far apart. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203608).

         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;and&#8208;shut case: Cucurbit[8]uril adsorbs robustly on transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) letting the cavity open for complex formation with melatonin and allowing efficient electrochemical sensing. This situation is reversed on graphene where the Cucurbit[8]uril's portals are closed, hindering the host&#8211;guest recognition. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.

The modular peptide probes with good selectivity and high affinity have attracted numerous attentions for the analysis and regulation of proteins with complex structure and complicated analytical environment. In this review, the design and optimization strategies of modular peptide probes and their research progress of their applications in the field of protein analysis are reviewed.







Abstract
The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Nowadays, ascribing to the editability and bioactivity of peptides, peptide&#8208;based probes could meet the requirements of good selectivity and high affinity to overcome the challenges. In this review, we summarize the advances in the use of modular peptide probes for proteins analysis. It focuses on how to design and optimize the structure of probes, as well as their performance. Then, the strategies and application to improve the analysis result of modular peptide probes are introduced. Finally, we also discuss current challenge and provide some ideas for the future direction for modular peptide probes, hoping to accelerate their clinical transformation.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Tuning the Properties of Cocatalysts</title>

Catalytic CRRiteria: This review summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR). It provides advanced knowledge on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR, serving as a general guide to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.







Abstract
Suppressing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an essential measure toward addressing global warming. Specifically, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. However, the practical application of photocatalyst&#8208;promoting CRR (CRR photocatalysts) requires significant improvement of their conversion efficiency. Accordingly, extensive research is being conducted toward improving semiconductor photocatalysts, as well as cocatalysts that are loaded as active sites on the photocatalysts. In this review, we summarize recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. We expect that the advanced knowledge provided on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR in this review will serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>How Research Data Management Plans Can Help in Harmonizing Open Science and Approaches in the Digital Economy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of open science into a digital economy, while considering legal European regulations, is a balancing act. Here research data management plans play a key role and has the potential to combine the interests of researchers as data producers and the public as data users in publicly funded projects.







Abstract
Within this perspective article, we intend to summarise definitions and terms that are often used in the context of open science and data&#8208;driven R&amp;D and we discuss upcoming European regulations concerning data, data sharing and handling. With this background in hand, we take a closer look at the potential connections and permeable interfaces of open science and digital economy, in which data and resulting immaterial goods can become vital pieces as tradeable items. We believe that both science and the digital economy can profit from a seamless transition and foresee that the scientific outcomes of publicly funded research can be better exploited. To close the gap between open science and the digital economy, and to serve for a balancing of the interests of data producers, data consumers, and an economy around services and the public, we introduce the concept of generic research data management plans (RDMs), which have in part been developed through a community effort and which have been evaluated by academic and industry members of the NFDI4Cat consortium. We are of the opinion that in data&#8208;driven research, RDMs do need to become a vital element in publicly funded projects.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The integration of open science&lt;/b&gt; into a digital economy, while considering legal European regulations, is a balancing act. Here research data management plans play a key role and has the potential to combine the interests of researchers as data producers and the public as data users in publicly funded projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A pH&#8208;Activatable Prodrug and Metal Prodrug Conjugate of Gossypol: Synthesis, Emergent Photophysical, Nanoscopic, Computational, and in vitro Cellular Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The major hurdle to the success of many potent chemotherapeutic drugs is the lack of stability for their active form suited for a particular mode of action. Efforts are needed to stabilize such functionalities by employing new and novel strategies to overcome such challenges. In this study, tumor&#8208;environment&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;activatable prodrugs and metal&#8208;prodrug conjugates have been developed to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs bearing reactive functionalities. As a proof of concept, a pre&#8208;clinically tested natural compound gossypol was modified to form a pH&#8208;responsive prodrug by incorporating imine linkage amenable to form confined molecular structures through coordination with a bio&#8208;relevant and non&#8208;toxic zinc metal ion. Detailed photophysical, computational, and nanoscopic studies revealed the unique zinc ion coordination behavior and its effect on molecular confinement. Computational studies demonstrated that an increasing degree of complexation, with Zn&#8208;N&#8208;Py coordination, gradually turns off fluorescence by reducing the band gap that allows nonradiative decay. In vitro prodrug activation and release of gossypol from gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn were assessed by ESI&#8208;MS and RP&#8208;HPLC studies. The gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn demonstrated pH&#8208;specific cytotoxicity validated by the number of in vitro cellular assays. Such a strategy can essentially be adapted to strengthen many chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance their efficacy and reduce related side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Assisted Generation of Arylmethyl Radicals from Bis(arylmethyl)tin Dichlorides: Efficient Reagents for 
&#8722;
 Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>

A new method for the efficient synthesis of diarylmethanes via a radical process involving thermolysis of bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides in the presence of arenes is reported. The intermediate arylmethyl radical can be trapped with TEMPO.







Abstract
The oxidative&#8208;addition reaction between an arylmethyl chloride (RCH2Cl; R=1&#8208;C10H7, 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 3&#8208;MeC6H4, C6H5, 4&#8208;ClC6H4) and tin powder in boiling toluene produces bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides, [(RCH2)2SnCl2] in good yields. At 160&#8201;&#176;C in mesitylene bis(1&#8208;naphthylmethyl)tin dichloride undergoes Sn&#8722;C homolytic cleavage to generate two 1&#8208;naphthylmethyl radicals (1&#8208;C10H7CH2&#8901;) which were trapped by TEMPO (C9H8NO&#8901;). Subsequently, the radicals (RCH2&#8901;) produced in this manner were utilized for efficient substitution reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes (R&#8242;H; R&#8242;=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 1,2,4,5&#8208;Me4C6H, 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Me5C6) to obtain a variety of unsymmetrical diarylmethanes (RR&#8242;CH2). The addition of one equivalent of iodine (I2) to the reaction mixture resulted in a significant increase in the yields of coupled products.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridyl functionalized amidinate [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)2]n was used to synthesize a series of bis&#8208;amidinate complexes [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au) with fully supported metallophilic interactions. These metalloligands were then used as building blocks for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymers using Zn(hfac)2 (hfac = hexaflouroacetylacetonate) for self&#8208;assembly. Interestingly, the three coordination polymers [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2][Zn(hfac)2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au), exhibit a zig zag shape in the solid state. To achieve linear coordination geometry other connectors such as M&#8217;(acac) (M&#8217; = Ni, Co) (acac = acetylacetonate) were investigated. The thus obtained compounds [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2][M&#8217;(acac)2] (M&#8217; = Ni, Co) are indeed linear heterobimetallic coordination polymers featuring a metalloligand backbone with fully supported metallophilic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbotrifluoromethylations of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds (Excluding Aryl&#8208; and Alkynyltrifluoromethylations)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One main method for the access of organofluorine compounds is the trifluoromethylative functionalization of an olefin bond, which simultaneously introduces a functional group and a trifluoromethyl element into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Organofluorine chemistry has become an expanding area of research in organic chemistry and drug design. The synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules has received high significance in synthetic chemistry. Trifluoromethylative difunctionalizations of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds with the simultaneous introduction of a CF3 group and another function have considerable relevance. Because of the high importance of carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions in organic synthesis, carbotrifluoromethylations are considered to be a field of synthetic chemistry of increasing importance. Our current goal in this review is to summarize recent developments of various trifluoromethylation reactions (excluding aryl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;trifluoromethylations) taking into consideration several main approaches, such as alkenyltrifluoromethylation, alkyltrifluoromethylation, carbonyltrifluoromethylation, and cyanotrifluoromethylation reactions.

Oligofuran. A series of coplanar polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties. These novel &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s have good hole transport capacity and can function as hole&#8208;transporting layers in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is indicative of significant breakthrough in the application of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans materials in OLEDs. And our findings offer an avenue for the ingenious use of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans as p&#8208;type organic semiconductors for OLEDs.







Abstract
Tuning the photophysical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers by functionalization of skeleton, to achieve an optically and electronically advantageous building block for organic semiconductor materials is a vital yet challenging task. In this work, a series of structurally well&#8208;defined polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers for the first time. This new synthetic strategy nicely circumvents the cumbersome substituent introduction process in the later stage by the preinstallation of the desired aryl groups in the starting material. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties.

         <title>Enantioselective and Chemoselective Phosphine Oxide&#8208;catalyzed Aldol Reactions of N&#8208;Unprotected Cyclic Carboxyimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides has been achieved. Silicon tetrachloride acts in&#8197;situ as a protecting and mediating reagent and is converted to a nucleophilic species for the aldol reaction. The use of a chiral phosphine oxide catalyst can achieve enantioselective aldol reactions (up to 91/9 dr and 97/3 er) of various N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides, including succinimides, hydantoins and glitazones.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic transformations of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides such as succinimides, hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, and glitazones, is a powerful way of directly accessing variety of biologically valuable chiral compounds. Herein, a bis(trichlorosilyl) nucleophilic intermediate formed from cyclic carboxyimides was reacted with aldehydes via (S)&#8208;SEGPHOS dioxide (SEGPHOSO), proceeding the aldol reaction in highly enantioselective fashion through a cyclic transition state. Furthermore, N&#8208;unprotected carboxyimides were chemoselectively activated, even in the presence of N&#8208;alkylated carboxyimides, to undergo stereoselective and chemoselective aldol reactions via in&#8197;situ silicon tetrachloride activation. The functionalized cyclic carboxyimides is readily derived to the several synthetic units derivatization to various chiral building blocks without unnecessary protection/deprotection steps.

         <title>Insights into the Photodynamics of Fluorescence Emission and Singlet Oxygen Generation of Fluorogen Activating Protein&#8208;Malachite Green Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malachite green will rapidly decay to ground state via internal conversion after excitation, since the free rotation significantly decreases the energy level of the excited state. However, after binding with the fluorogen activating protein, the interaction will greatly restrict the excited&#8208;state rotation and allow the fluorescence turn&#8208;on and 1O2 generation.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled fluorogen activating protein (FAP)&#8208;malachite green (MG) complex is a well&#8208;established protein&#8208;ligand system, which can realize binding&#8208;caused fluorescence turn&#8208;on of MG and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation by MG iodination. To clarify the mechanism of fluorescence activation and 1O2 generation, the photodynamics of different halogen&#8208;substituted MG derivatives and their corresponding FAP&#8208;MG complexes were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The results show that the rotation of MG is restricted by FAP binding, which prevents a rapid internal conversion to allow a longer lifetime for the excited MG to undergo fluorescence emission and intersystem crossing. Moreover, these FAP&#8208;MG complexes exhibit notably varied fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL) and 1O2 yields. The study on the decay pathways indicates that such an anti&#8208;heavy atom effect predominately stems from the lifetimes of the excited&#8208;state species. The photodynamic mechanism study here will lead to more advanced FAP&#8208;MG systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Reversing the Bond Length Alternation Order in Conjugated Polyenes by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond lengths are widely utilised as observable structure parameters to estimate the contributions of particular resonance structures. Herein, it is demonstrated that outstandingly strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can reverse the textbook bond&#8208;length alternation order in polyene systems. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the neutral Lewis resonance form.







Abstract
We have synthesised several push&#8208;pull substituted conjugated polyenes and determined their accurate C&#8722;C bond lengths and charge&#8208;density distributions by utilising quantum crystallographic techniques. In a series of alkene, dienes, and triene bearing two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (triflyl) groups on the terminal carbon atom, unique reversal of the bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) order has been observed. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the Lewis&#8208;structure&#8208;based neutral resonance structure. Such reversal of BLA order has not been observed in push&#8208;pull compounds bearing conventional electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and cyano groups instead of triflyl groups. Bonding behaviour of both normal and reversed bond length alternating systems has been revealed by complementary bonding analysis using several bond descriptors based on the experimentally fitted wavefunctions.

         <title>Two Rings Around One Ball: Stability and Charge Localization of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] Complex Ions of [10]CPP and C60/70[*]</title>

Stability and charge distribution of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complex ions of [10]cycloparaphenylene with C60 and C70 are studied in energy resolved gas&#8208;phase collision experiments. The novel [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in solution. Thermodynamic insight is obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. DFT analyses as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data.







Abstract
We investigate the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of noncovalent complexes of [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) with C60 and C70 by means of atmospheric pressure photoionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The literature&#8208;known [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, namely [10]CPP&#8835;C60 and [10]CPP&#8835;C70, are observed as radical cations and anions. Their stability and charge distribution are studied using energy&#8208;resolved collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ER&#8208;CID). These measurements reveal that complexes with a C70 core exhibit a greater stability and, on the other hand, that the radical cations are more stable than the respective radical anions. Regarding the charge distribution, in anionic complexes charges are exclusively located on C60 or C70, while the charges reside on [10]CPP in the case of cationic complexes. [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes of the ([10]CPP2&#8835;C60/70)+&#8901;/&#8722;&#8901; type are observed for the first time as isolated solitary gas&#8208;phase species. Here, C60&#8208;based [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are less stable than the respective C70 analogues. By virtue of the high stability of cationic [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes show a strongly reduced stability of the radical cations. DFT analyses of the minimum geometries as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data. Furthermore, our novel gas&#8208;phase [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Insights into the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process as well as the species distribution are derived from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements.

         <title>Bimetallic Nickel Complexes Supported by a Planar Macrocyclic Diphosphoranide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel promotes the formation of a highly unusual planar dinucleating macrocycle PONNOPONNO. Bimetallic dinickel complexes of PONNOPONNO contain direct metal&#8208;metal interactions and trans reactive sites. Control over the ligand architecture is obtained by tuning the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or traditional pincer architectures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;metal cooperativity is emerging as an important strategy in catalysis. This requires appropriate ligand scaffolds that can support two metals in close proximity. Here we report nickel&#8208;promoted formation of a dinucleating planar macrocyclic ligand that can support bimetallic dinickel(II) and dinickel(I) complexes. Reaction outcomes can be tuned by variation of the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or conventional pincer architectures.

         <title>A Versatile Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization Route to Functional Polyesters from an Activated Diester Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;by&#8208;step: A versatile and efficient step&#8208;growth polymerization route is described for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined functional polyesters with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity by organocatalyzed transesterification of activated pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester of adipic acid with structurally diverse diols under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
This work describes a versatile and efficient condensation polymerization route to aliphatic polyesters by organo&#8208;catalyzed (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) transesterification reactions between an activated pentafluorophenyl&#8208;diester of adipic acid and structurally different diols. By introducing &#8220;monofunctional impurity&#8221; or &#8220;stoichiometric imbalance,&#8221; this methodology can afford well&#8208;defined end&#8208;functionalized polyesters with predictable molecular weights and narrow dispersity under mild conditions without any necessity for the removal of the byproducts to accelerate the polymerization reaction, which remains a major challenge in conventional polyester synthesis with non&#8208;activated diesters. Wide substrate scope with structurally different monomers and the synthesis of block copolymers by chain extension following either ring&#8208;opening polymerization or controlled radical polymerization have been successfully demonstrated. Some of the polyesters synthesized by this newly introduced approach show high thermal stability, crystallinity, and enzymatic degradation in aqueous environments.

         <title>Solvato&#8208;Controlled Assembly and Structural Transformation of Emissive Poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;Based Organometallic Cages and Their Applications in Amino Acid Sensing and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;induced structural transformation of supramolecular cages has drawn increasing attention because of their sensitive feature to external variations as model systems to simulate biological processes. However, combining structural transformation and useful functions has remained a difficult task. In this study, we report the solvato&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of two unique topologies with different emission characteristics, a water&#8208;soluble Ag8L4 cage (A) and an Ag4L2 cage (B), produced from the same sulfonate&#8208;pendant tetraphenylethene (TPE) bridged tetrakis&#8208;(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) ligand. Both cages showed interesting solvent&#8208;responsive reversible structural transformation, and the change of fluorescence signals can efficiently track the process. Additionally, water&#8208;soluble cage A exhibits unique properties in thermochromism, thiol amino acid sensing, and subcellular imaging in aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>TBAI&#8208;catalysed [4 + 4]&#8208;cyclization reaction of anthranils with hydrazones to deliver oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in accepted yields was developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction involved the in&#8208;situ generation of vinyldiazenes from readily available hydrazones followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition of the anthranil substrates onto the vinyldiazenes and subsequent annulation. This transformation involved the formation of two new C&#8208;N bonds and C&#8208;O bond in one pot, overcoming the synthetic limitations of anthranils in organic chemistry. This strategy benefits from high efficiency and atomic economy with mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Full Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine Base Paring: Self&#8208;assembly and Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of self&#8208;assembly systems that can mimic partial biological behaviours require ingenious and delicate design. For decades, scientists are committed to exploring new base pairing patterns using hydrogen bonds directed assembly of nucleotides. A fundamental question is the adaptive circumstance of the recognition between base pairs, namely, how solvent conditions affect the domain of base pairs. Towards this question, three nucleotide complexes based on 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dCMP) and cytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (CMP) were synthesized in different solvents and pH values, and an unusual cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring (named full C : C base pairing) were successfully obtained. Systematic single crystal analysis and 1H&#8208;NMR titration spectra have been performed to explore factors influencing the formation of base paring patterns. Moreover, supramolecular chirality of three complexes were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in solution and solid&#8208;state combined with crystal structure analysis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of self-assembly systems that can mimic partial biological behaviours require ingenious and delicate design. For decades, scientists are committed to exploring new base pairing patterns using hydrogen bonds directed assembly of nucleotides. A fundamental question is the adaptive circumstance of the recognition between base pairs, namely, how solvent conditions affect the domain of base pairs. Towards this question, three nucleotide complexes based on 2&#8217;-deoxycytidine-5&#8217;-monophosphate (dCMP) and cytidine-5&#8217;-monophosphate (CMP) were synthesized in different solvents and pH values, and an unusual cytosine-cytosine base paring (named full C : C base pairing) were successfully obtained. Systematic single crystal analysis and 1H-NMR titration spectra have been performed to explore factors influencing the formation of base paring patterns. Moreover, supramolecular chirality of three complexes were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in solution and solid-state combined with crystal structure analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Evidence of the Incipient Oxocarbenium Ion as a &#8220;Hidden Intermediate&#8221; During the Cyclization of Hydroxyenol Ether into Spiroketal Under Mild Acidic Condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of spiroketals have gained attention because of their importance in chemical and biological reactions. Yet, the mechanistic investigation of mild acid&#8208;catalyzed spiroketalization remains elusive and less explored in the literature and speculated that such transformations may proceed through the oxocarbenium ion intermediate; however, the existence of such species in spiroketalization are not documented. The computational study has been performed at M062X/6 &#8211; 31 + G(d) level to examine the kinetically controlled product formation for such reactions and the intrinsic reaction coordinates of 1d suggests that the reaction proceeds via a one&#8208;step, two&#8208;stage&#160;mechanism with the formation of transient oxocarbenium as a hidden intermediate&#160;in the reaction. This study reveals the stereoelectronic interactions devoid the formation of stable oxocarbenium ion intermediate after the proton transfer transition state in the case of mid acid catalyzed spiroketalization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation at Single or Multiple Positions to Control Sugar&#8208;Protein Connectivity in Glycoconjugate Vaccine Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antigen&#8208;carrier connectivity, if controlled, can help improving immunological response to glycoconjugate vaccines. In this work, it is shown that a site&#8208;selectively triple conjugated vaccine candidate against Streptococcus pneumoniae presents a better antigenicity than its randomly conjugated counterpart.







Abstract
In cellulo site&#8208;specific unnatural amino acid incorporation based on amber stop codon reassignment is a powerful tool to modify proteins at defined positions. This technique is herein applied to the selective functionalization of the Pneumococcal surface adhesin A protein at three distinct positions. N&#1013;&#8208;propargyloxycarbonyl&#8208;l&#8208;lysine residues were incorporated and their alkyne groups reacted using click&#8208;chemistry with a synthetic azido&#8208;functionalized tetrasaccharide representative of one repeat unit of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide. Anti&#8208;PsaA antibody response induced in mice by the trivalent glycoconjugate was determined in comparison with corresponding monovalent and randomly functionalized conjugates. Our results suggest that controlled was superior to random conjugation for preserving antigenicity. In definitive, the reported strategy offers a unique opportunity to study the impact of carbohydrate antigen&#8208;carrier protein connectivity on immunogenicity.

         <title>Green and Fast Strategies for Energy&#8208;Efficient Preparation of the Covalent Organic Framework TpPa&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized synthesis for sustainable TpPa&#8208;1. Three strategies for organic solvent&#8208;free syntheses of covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 have been developed. Improved textural properties and yields were achieved through a modified two&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis. The water&#8208;based solvothermal synthesis with reaction times reduced more than 100&#8208;fold by microwave assistance makes it a more energy&#8208;efficient and less expensive process.







Abstract
Three synthesis procedures for the covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) TpPa&#8208;1 are studied with the purpose of setting up the most promising one in a fast and green way, leading to a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process. With conventional heating, good crystallinity and a high BET specific surface area (SSA) of up to 1007&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 are achieved at 170&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;days using water as the quintessential green solvent. However, the application of microwave radiation in the synthesis for this crystalline porous polymer allows reaction times to be shortened to 30&#8197;min while maintaining structural and textural properties (BET SSA of 928&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and obtaining yields close to 98&#8201;% (vs. 90&#8201;% in the hydrothermal synthesis). The water&#8208;assisted mechanochemical synthesis is also an environmentally friendly synthetic approach; with heating at 170&#8201;&#176;C in a two&#8208;step process (10+10&#8197;min), high crystallinity is achieved, a BET SSA of 960&#8197; m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a yield of 98&#8201;% for TpPa&#8208;1.

         <title>Supramolecular Aggregation Control in Polyoxometalates Covalently Functionalized with Oligoaromatic Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of Dawson type molecular metal oxides covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups is reported using a facile CLICK chemistry approach. The supramolecular chemistry of these organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids as well as their interactions with model photosensitizers are studied as basis for photoinduced electron transfer and storage systems.







Abstract
CLICK&#8208;chemistry has become a universal route to covalently link organic molecules functionalized with azides and alkynes, respectively. Here, we report how CLICK&#8208;chemistry can be used to attach oligoaromatic organic moieties to Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates. In step one, the lacunary Dawson anion [&#945;2&#8208;P2W17O61]6&#8722; is functionalized with phosphonate anchors featuring peripheral azide groups. In step two, this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid undergoes microwave&#8208;assisted CLICK coupling. We demonstrate the versatility of this route to access a series of Dawson anions covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups. The supramolecular chemistry and aggregation of these systems in solution is explored, and we report distinct changes in charge&#8208;transfer behavior depending on the size of the oligoaromatic &#960;&#8208;system.

         <title>The Role of the Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Hydroxyl Ligand in the Activation of O2 Performed by [Ni(H)(OH)]+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of dioxygen activation by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was studied by a state&#8208;of&#8208;art multiconfigurational calculations. The role of redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent hydroxyl in [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was elucidated, that is an energy reservoir instead of being the reaction center as what most of bioinorganic complexes show.







Abstract
The cationic complex [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was previously found to activate dioxygen and methane in gas phase under single collision conditions. These remarkable reactivities were thought to originate from a non&#8208;classical electronic structure, where the Ni&#8208;center adopts a Ni(II), instead of the classically expected Ni(III) oxidation state by formally accepting an electron from the hydroxo ligand, which formally becomes a hydroxyl radical in the process. Such radicaloid oxygen moieties are envisioned to easily react with otherwise inert substrates, mimicking familiar reactivities of free radicals. In this study, the reductive activation of dioxygen by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ to afford the hydroperoxo species was investigated using coupled cluster, multireference ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Orbital and wave function analyses indicate that O2 binding tranforms the aforementioned non&#8208;classical electronic structure to a classical Ni(III)&#8208;hydroxyl system, before O2 reduction takes place. Remarkably, we found no evidence for a direct involvement of the radicaloid hydroxyl in the reaction with O2, as is often assumed. The function of the redox non&#8208;innocent character of the activator complex is to protect the reactive electronic structure until the complex engages O2, upon which a dramatic electronic reorganization releases internal energy and drives the chemical reaction to completion.

         <title>Biohybrid Microswimmers for Antibiotic Drug Delivery Based on a Thiol&#8208;Sensitive Release Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports on the design and engineering of biohybrid microswimmers exploiting a thiol&#8208;mediated self&#8208;immolative antibiotic release strategy. The design features a covalent attachment of a vancomycin conjugate via a disulfide&#8208;based linker to the surface of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The antibiotic release from the surface of these biohybrids was triggered by the addition of a thiol&#8208;based reducing agent, and, subsequently, the inhibition of bacterial growth was observed for Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These engineered microbots represent the first example of a microalgae&#8208;based drug delivery system with a thiol&#8208;mediated, reductive release of an antibiotic drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Y&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photocatalysts for Efficient Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production on BiVO4 photocatalysts using water and oxygen as raw materials is a green and sustainable process. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine BiVO4 is limited by severe charge recombination. In this work, the rare earth element Yttrium (Y) doped BiVO4 photocatalysts are fabricated via the hydrothermal method. In the photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment, the optimized Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 photocatalyst produces 114 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 of H2O2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5) irradiation, which is four times that of pure BiVO4 (26 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Y doping can enhance oxygen adsorption on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the doping process induces the in situ formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction, which further promotes the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Monodentate and Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Bis(enones): A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the green and high efficient of chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been aroused great interest. In this work, the ChB catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). The mechanism was divided into four processes: the promoter addition process, the carbon&#8208;carbon bond coupling process, the hydrogen transfer process, and the promoter elimination process. This study shows that the ChB catalyst could act on the promoter and reactant in the RC reaction, respectively. And the path2 of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction due to a lower energy barrier. In addition, all six catalysts could achieve good catalytic effect. Analysis of the properties shows that the formation of chalcogen bond mainly promotes the charge transfer of LP(O) &#8208; BD*(C&#8208;Se) in the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation (key step), so that the charge of C(4) atom become more positive, thereby accelerating the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;state Method and its MTO Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and efficient strategy for synthesizing phosphorus modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is proposed by grinding phosphorus source, silicon source and aluminum source with the solvent&#8208;free conditions. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin selectivity and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The traditional hydrothermal synthesis strategy of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is energy&#8208;consumption accompanying by pollution issues. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;modified layered ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites (PZ) were obtained by one&#8208;pot synthesis under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The synthesized samples were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, NH3&#8208;TPD and FTIR. The effect of phosphorus addition on the morphology and catalytic activity of ZSM&#8208;5 was investigated. The results showed that phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin (ethylene and propylene) selectivity (above 50&#8201;%) and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite synthesized by in&#8197;situ solvent&#8208;free method, which not only reduced the discharge of sewage but also showed a simple method to realize the introduction of phosphorous species, which provided a new idea for phosphorus modification of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite.

         <title>Enhanced Solvent and Thermal Stability in Cross&#8208;Linkable Conjugated Statistical Copolymers for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT statistical copolymers containing hydroxyl groups attached to the P3HHT components was synthesized by KCTP polymerization. They occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on manner at 150&#8201;&#176;C, while losing the ordered packing at 300&#8201;&#176;C. The cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device&#8208;related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208;stat&#8208;poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross&#8208;linkable hydroxyl groups is synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT thin films in their as&#8208;cast state crystallize well in an edge&#8208;on orientation. During annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C, these P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high&#8208;temperature annealing at 300&#8201;&#176;C, their edge&#8208;on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross&#8208;linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state.

     alt="Enhanced Solvent and Thermal Stability in Cross-Linkable Conjugated Statistical Copolymers for Organic Field-Effect Transistors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A set of P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT statistical copolymers&lt;/b&gt; containing hydroxyl groups attached to the P3HHT components was synthesized by KCTP polymerization. They occur cross-linked and retain edge-on manner at 150&#8201;&#176;C, while losing the ordered packing at 300&#8201;&#176;C. The cross-linked P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in organic field-effect transistors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;-conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device-related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3-hexylthiophene)-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-poly[3-(6-hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross-linkable hydroxyl groups is synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT thin films in their as-cast state crystallize well in an edge-on orientation. During annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C, these P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT occur cross-linked and retain edge-on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high-temperature annealing at 300&#8201;&#176;C, their edge-on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross-linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state. The correlation between different P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT and their charge mobilities is scrutinized. These cross-linked P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in OFETs. Conceptually, such side-chain functionalization approach to improve the stability of P3HT-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-P3HHT can be conveniently extended to other conjugated polymers for diverse optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A four&#8208;step approach to a presilphiperfolanol: Allylation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pulegone followed by an alkylation renders a trisubstituted cyclohexanone, which leads to a bridged bicyclo[4.3.1]undecen&#8208;one by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The embedded alkene&#8208;ketone functionalization is key for the metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) intramolecular &#8220;alkene first&#8221; radical process leading to the epimer at C&#8208;4 of presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;ol.







Abstract
From an (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;pulegone&#8208;derived building block that incorporates the stereo&#8208;defined tertiary carbon bearing a methyl group, as found in the targeted sesquiterpenoid, a four&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;4&#8208;epi&#8208;presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ol was achieved. The key processes involved are a ring&#8208;closing metathesis leading to a bridged alkene&#8208;tethered ketone and its subsequent FeIII&#8208;mediated metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) transannular cyclization. This synthetic method, implying an irreversible addition of a carbon&#8208;centered radical upon a ketone by means of a hydrogen atom transfer upon the alkoxy radical intermediate, was also applied in the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused hydrindanols structurally related to botrydial compounds.

         <title>Biomineralized Piezoelectrically Active Scaffolds for Inducing Osteogenic Differentiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bone tissue engineering scaffold was developed. The scaffold was realized by coupling porous poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) coating and calcium phosphate (CaP) coating. Piezoelectric effects can be produced by low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, the self&#8208;motion of the animal body. Through the coupling of piezoelectric effect and physicochemical properties, the scaffold has good osteoinductive ability.







Abstract
There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self&#8208;powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three&#8208;dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three&#8208;dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating. The preferred scaffold has an open circuit voltage and short circuit current output of 5&#8197;V and 200&#8197;nA. Combining the physical and chemical properties of the CaP coating, the piezoelectric signal of PVDF&#8208;HFP and the three&#8208;dimensional structure of PUF, the scaffold exhibits superior promotion of cell osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation in&#8197;vivo. The mechanism is attributed to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to chemical and piezoelectric stimulation with the material. This research not only paves the way for the application of piezoelectric scaffolds to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation in&#8197;situ, but also lays the foundation for the clinical treatment of long&#8208;term osteoporosis.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Behavior of 7&#8208;Azaindole for Mechanistic Investigation of Chan&#8208;Lam Coupling and Application to 7&#8208;Azaindole Based Pharmacophores</title>

         <dc:description>
Using a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system, Chan&#8208;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;azaindole is discussed. A new mechanism confirming the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species for the cross&#8208;coupling pathway is proposed by identifying and characterizing key reaction intermediates through detailed spectroscopic, crystallographic investigations, DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. A 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor, important in the medical field, is synthesized via sequential arylation.







Abstract
Multiple spectroscopic techniques, along with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, have been used to reveal the detailed structural and electronic information on reaction intermediates of a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system for the N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;Azaindole. The reaction mixture of Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling yields two dimeric copper(II)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole complexes, including one attached with DBU, prior to adding arylboronic acid and are confirmed structurally and spectroscopically. A suitable mechanism has been proposed using the dimeric copper(II) complex as a catalyst for the coupling reactions. The role of DBU as a base and also as an auxiliary ligand in the course of the reaction has been established. The transmetalated monomeric aryl&#8208;copper(II) species generated from the dimeric unit is oxidized by another equivalent of copper(II) to yield an aryl&#8208;copper(III) intermediate for facile N&#8208;arylation, which has been authenticated with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The regeneration of the copper(II)&#8208;catalyst by aerial oxidation of colorless copper(I) species (generated via reductive elimination and disproportionation step) is confirmed by mass and absorption spectroscopy. Detailed DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations help to rationalize the proposed reaction intermediates and their corresponding electronic transitions. Moreover, the confirmation of copper(I)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole intermediate via HRMS reaffirmed the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species in the Chan&#8208;Lam type of coupling. A medicinally&#8208;important 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor has been synthesized via sequential arylation.

         <title>Coordination and Stabilization of a Lithium Ion with a Silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization effect: We have synthesized and characterized a silylene stabilized lithium ion 1. Compound 1 exhibits presence of two four&#8208; membered and one six&#8208; membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Compound 2 shows unusual dissociation of carbodiimide to give two four&#8208;membered rings containing a penta&#8208;coordinated silicon as a central atom. Furthermore, the bond nature and stabilization of compound 1 were confirmed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of lithium&#8208;ion as the source of lithium to use as a trans&#8208;metalation reagent [{PhC(NtBu)2Si(tBu)Li}2I(tBuN)2CPh] (1). The reaction of 3 equivalents of the LSitBu (L=PhC(NtBu)2) and lithium iodide at low temperature leads to a silylene stabilized lithium&#8208;ion with an additional coordination of amidinate ligand. Compound 1 shows two four membered and one six membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Whereas the reaction of the LSiCl with 1.5 equivalents of carbodiimide (CyN)2C at room temperature affords compound [PhC(NtBu)2Si(Cl)(NCy)2NCy] (2) with the CN2SiN2C skeleton containing silicon as a central atom. Both the compounds were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and quantum mechanical calculations.

         <title>Fluorinated Dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dione: A Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Unit with Organic Semiconductor Characteristics</title>

Toward D&#8208;A&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules: Fluorinated pentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD), a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit was designed, and a derivative that contains a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) conjugated molecule for use in organic semiconducting materials is reported. The compound was characterized based on its electrochemical properties, photophysical properties, and X&#8208;ray analyses to elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationships of the compounds.







Abstract
The development of electron&#8208;accepting units is of significant importance because the construction of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) configurations is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Although doubly fused pentagons represented by diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been used as an effective electron&#8208;accepting unit, the relatively high&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels (FMOs) leave room for further improvement. We report herein the synthesis of a fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) derivative as a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit and the development of D&#8722;A&#8722;D &#960;&#8208;extended molecules. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed that the presence of fluorine atoms contributed to the formation of high planar structures and slipped&#8208;stacked packing. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the FPD derivatives showed relatively lower FMO energy levels than the corresponding DPP&#8208;containing derivatives. The D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecule based on terthiophene and FPD showed semiconducting responses. This study demonstrates that the FPD unit can function as a new acceptor unit for organic semiconductors.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization Triggered by Iminium&#8208;Enamine Activation: Access to Complex Cyclohepta[b]indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalysis: Asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones has been developed by using organocatalytic iminium&#8208;enamine activation. The reaction provides an access to bicyclic enones with excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation to afford highly strained and complex cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres.







Abstract
The expeditious construction of complex molecules having multiple stereocentres is highly desirable in organic chemistry. In the present communication, we report the development of an organocatalytic asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones via the C3&#8208;selective Friedel&#8722;Crafts alkylation of indoles triggered by LUMO&#8208;lowering iminium activation/HOMO&#8208;raising enamine activation. The reaction provides access to bicyclic enones, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation from C2&#8208;position to afford highly strained cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres and three new C&#8722;C bonds in excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pathway to access polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds from simple starting materials has been investigated. The starting materials are funneled in an organocatalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition that generates three&#8208;dimensional polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds. The compounds are then easily flattened to their two&#8208;dimensional analogues by oxidation. More information can be found in the Concept by K.&#8197;A. J&#248;rgensen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204008).

         <title>3,11&#8208;Diaminodibenzo[a,j]phenazine: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications to Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Forming Ladder Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aminophenazine functional molecule: It displays efficient photoluminescence and positive luminochromism in organic solvent. Not only useful it is as luminophore, but also does it serve as a building block for Tr&#246;ger's base regioregular ladder polymer. The ladder polymer nicely shows reversible adsorption/desorption behavior of carbon dioxide molecule.







Abstract
A new class of diamino&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;extended phenazine compound was synthesized, and its photophysical properties were investigated. The U&#8208;shaped diaminophenazine displayed photoluminescence in solution with moderate quantum yield. The diamino aromatic compound was found applicable to the poly&#8208;condensation with formaldehyde to form Tr&#246;ger's base ladder polymer. The obtained microporous ladder polymer features high CO2 adsorption selectivity against N2, most likely due to the presence of basic nitrogen atoms in the phenazine rings.

         <title>Diverse Cooperative Reactivity at a Square Planar Aluminium Complex and Catalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural constraint imparted by a sterically demanding pincer ligand results in an unusual tetracoordinate aluminium Lewis acid that undergoes multiple modes of metal&#8208;ligand cooperative reactivity with ketones and CO2. Adding HBpin allows for the catalytic hydroboration of carbonyl&#8208;containing substrates and the reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent.







Abstract
The use of a sterically demanding pincer ligand to prepare an unusual square planar aluminium complex is reported. Due to the constrained geometry imposed by the ligand scaffold, this four&#8208;coordinate aluminium centre remains Lewis acidic and reacts via differing metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathways for activating ketones and CO2. It is also a rare example of a single&#8208;component aluminium system for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent at room temperature.

         <title>Quinoid Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles with NIR&#8208;II Absorption Peak Toward Efficient Photothermal Therapy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoid conjugated polymer PIS with broad absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region is developed based on multiple strategies. Benefiting from its remarkable photothermal conversion behavior under NIR&#8208;II laser (1064&#8197;nm), PIS nanoparticles show excellent antitumor performances in both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies. This work presents a rational design strategy to explore NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents for hyperthermia therapy.







Abstract
Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of the second near&#8208;infrared bio&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic agents owing to the excellent tissue&#8208;penetration capability of NIR&#8208;II light. The exploration of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy materials, especially those with absorption peak over 1000&#8197;nm, is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, we have designed conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PIS NPs) with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak at 1026&#8197;nm through a combined strategy of introducing quinoid donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, constructing intramolecular &#8220;conformational locks&#8221; and extending the conjugation area to narrow the band gap. Irradiated at 1064&#8197;nm, PIS NPs showed remarkable photothermal conversion performance for efficient photothermal ablation of tumor cells in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This study provides useful insights into the rational design of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents based on multiple strategies.

         <title>Plenates: Anion&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of the Pyrrole Cage Encapsulating Silver(I) Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded a series of new cascade complexes or plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The tripyrrolic cage is represented by a wooden chest hiding the treasure, which in the case of plenates, contains a pile of shiny silver atoms. In contrast, for cascade complexes, two precious metals lie next to anions shown as colorful gems. Obviously, such treasure cannot remain unprotected&#8230; More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Szyszko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203850).

         <title>Live Monitoring of Anionic Living Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry easily distinguishes the different living oligomers resulting from the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the acceptor&#8208;substituted cyclopropane Mcyclic. Kinetic modeling reproduces the measured time evolution of the growing oligomers and affords the rate constants of the individual propagation steps.

         <title>Tailoring Galactose Oxidase for Self&#8208;powered Benzyl Alcohol Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Benzyl alcohol (BnOH) is a widely&#8208;used preservative in a variety of cosmetics, but the excess addition (&#8805;1.0%) may cause strong symptoms such as nausea, gastrointestinal irritation, convulsion, even death, making it crucial to monitor and control the addition quantity. Herein, we have developed a test&#8208;strip&#8208;like BnOH detection method via tailoring a galactose oxidase (GOase) towards BnOH oxidation and preparing a self&#8208;powered electrochromic strip for BnOH concentration visualization. A double&#8208;substituted GOase variant (Y329S/R330F) on the basis of the reported GOase M1 has been obtained by semi&#8208;rational design with a 24.6&#8208;fold improved activity towards BnOH compared to GOase M1. The GOase Y329S/R330F electrode responses BnOH with a linear range of 0.04 to 3.25 mM (R2=0.9985), a sensitivity of 122.78 &#181;A mM&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, and a detection limit of 0.03 mM (S/N=3). Coupling an electrochromic Prussian blue (PB) cathode helps the successful sensing visualization without any further power supply. The present sensing is more convenient and user&#8208;friendly than the generally used gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and brings a more accessible solution to the field of quality controlling.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diradical&#8208;Mediated ipso&#8208;Cyclization towards Double Dearomative [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition or Smiles&#8208;Type Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
Diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization involving dearomatizing spiro&#8208;intermediates of aromatic compounds towards divergent reaction pathways deserves investigation but has been rarely reported so far. By tuning the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage in the key dearomatizing spiro intermediate, a chemical divergent reaction of (hetero)aryl sulfonamides has been achieved in a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced energy transfer reaction pathway involving diradical species.







Abstract
When mono&#8208;radical ipso&#8208;cyclization of aryl sulfonamides tend to undergo Smiles&#8208;type rearrangement through aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;S bond cleavage, diradical&#8208;mediated cyclization must perform in a distinct reaction pathway. It is interesting meanwhile challenging to tune the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage to achieve a chemically divergent reaction of (hetero) aryl sulfonamides in a visible&#8208;light induced energy transfer (EnT) reaction pathway involving diradical species. Herein a chemically divergent reaction based on the designed indole&#8208;tethered (hetero)arylsulfonamides is reported which involves a diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization and a controllable cleavage of an inherent C&#8722;S bond. The combined experimental and computational results have revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond in these substrates can be controlled by tuning the heteroaryl moieties: a) If the (hetero)aryl is thienyl, furyl, phenanthryl, etc., the radical coupling of double dearomative diradicals (DDDR) precedes over C&#8722;S bond cleavage to afford cyclobutene fused indolines by double dearomative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition; b) if the (hetero)aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl, indolyl etc., the cleavage of C&#8722;S bond in DDDR is favored over radical coupling to afford biaryl products.

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with Stokes shift of 120 nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57 ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73 ppm. Metal binding (2:1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072 mol&#8208;1s&#8208;1) are calculated from Job&#8217;s and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1&#8208;minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20 &#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2 &#956;g/mL</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rational designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks as multifunctional filler constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects&#160;feature of Ga2O3&#160;filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite&#160;electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window&#160;(over 5.3&#160;V versus Li/Li+)&#160;but also in&#8208;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+&#160;ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte achieves the effect of stabilizing interfacial with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained a superior cycling performance of 146 mAh g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C.&#160;The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks can form a Li&#8208;Ga alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface.&#160;This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of ESIPT in a Systematically Constructed Series of Benzimidazole Based Schiff Base Probes: Application as Chemosensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8208;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8208;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold to Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule Gramicidin A. The scaffold 1 derived from pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units present in 1 are oriented outwardly. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like Gramicidin A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12 mS/cm at 95 &#176;C and 95% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098 eV indicating Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules for achieving efficient solid state proton conduction.</dc:description>

Abstract

Despite the significance, the direct construction of hetero&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted benzene core was far less&#8208;developed. Herein, we realized a DBU&#8208;mediated isomerization/6&#8208;&#960; electro&#8208;cyclization/oxidative aromatization cascade of sulfonyl&#8208;substituted allenyl ketones under an air atmosphere (DBU=1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene). This versatile protocol featured metal&#8208;free conditions, easy operation, and broad functional group tolerance provides a new avenue for the construction of hetero&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted benzene.

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Transition Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting beyond first base: To choose the best base in NHC complex syntheses, considerations beyond pKa values are necessary. The high activity of ionic bases can be explained through their affinity to form ion pairs with the substrate imidazolium cation, allowing for a more frequent interaction with the acidic site of the ring.







Abstract
The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and trimethylamine, both facilitate complex formation. In contrast to previous experiments, these calculations indicated a slightly lower barrier with the amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keep these species associated in the reaction mixture through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters that are essential for the metal complex formation reaction. The neutral amine, however, remains mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective base.

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8208;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to better spectra: Dynamic nuclear polarization, sparse isotope labeling, and methyl dynamics have been combined to yield site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein. For L7Ae protein in complex with guide RNA from box C/D complex, a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact can be spectroscopically isolated.







Abstract
Sensitivity and specificity are both crucial for the efficient solid&#8208;state NMR structure determination of large biomolecules. We present an approach that features both advantages by site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This approach uses modern biochemical techniques for sparse isotope labeling and exploits the molecular dynamics of 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups exclusively present in the protein. These dynamics drive heteronuclear cross relaxation and thus allow specific hyperpolarization transfer across the biomolecular complex's interface. For the example of the L7Ae protein in complex with a 26mer guide RNA minimal construct from the box C/D complex in archaea, we demonstrate that a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact is responsible for most of the polarization transfer to the RNA, and that this specific transfer can be used to boost both NMR spectral sensitivity and specificity by DNP.

         <title>Tetrelanes versus Tetrylenes as Precursors to Transition Metal Complexes Featuring Tridentate PEP Tetryl Ligands (E=Si, Ge, Sn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP ligands: Two general synthetic approaches to the synthesis of tridentate PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) metal complexes are presented as a function of the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the final PEP tetryl ligand. For each approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in their corresponding complexes are presented and discussed.







Abstract
Two synthetic approaches have until now been used to synthesize transition metal complexes having a tridentate (pincer or tripod) PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) ligand. These approaches differ in the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the corresponding PEP tetryl ligand. Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane&#8208;free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8722;X bond (X=H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low&#8208;valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8722;X bond (X=Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis: Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cyclocondensation of (in situ Generated) Aryl Imines with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluronium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were prepared, and their ability to drive chalcogen bonds with ketones and imines was demonstrated in the solid state and in solution. These strong &#963;&#8208;hole bond donors were able to efficiently catalyze the Povarov reaction through chalcogen bond activation of imines and subsequent reaction with alkenes. The title reaction was found to be as efficient with pre&#8208;formed or in situ generated imines.







Abstract
In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron&#8208;rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium&#8208;based derivatives and their use in different applications, such as organocatalysis. In this context, the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction is presented herein. Different dienophiles, as well as imines of variable electronic nature, efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three&#8208;component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR spectroscopy. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N&#8208;phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22&#8211;38&#8197;M&#8722;1 were measured in dichloromethane.

         <title>Activity Sensing of Coagulation and Fibrinolytic Proteases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic activity&#8208;based peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The existing strategies summarized in this review could contribute to the challenges ahead in the field of coagulation and fibrinolytic monitoring, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.







Abstract
The blood coagulation cascade is a complex physiological process involving the action of multiple coupled enzymes, cofactors, and substrates, ultimately leading to clot formation. Serine proteases have a crucial role, and aberrations in their activity can lead to life&#8208;threatening bleeding disorders and thrombosis. This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The information in this review can contribute to developing novel anticoagulant therapies and specific substrates for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis of coagulation pathologies.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Dependent Photoexcitation Processes of &#960;&#8208;Stacked Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of porphyrin ions with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes.







Abstract
Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, has been synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the lifetimes of the radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer of the ion pairs could be controlled by a judicious combination of the anions and cations.

         <title>Fully Tin&#8208;Coated Coinage Metal Ions: A Pincer&#8208;Type Bis&#8208;stannylene Ligand for Exclusive Tetrahedral Complexation</title>

Tin shines better with gold or silver: A luminescent pincer&#8208;type bis&#8208;stannylene ligand for exclusive tetrahedral coordination of the coinage metals was designed, and photoluminescence investigations as well as extensive quantum chemical calculations were carried out.







Abstract
The synthesis of a novel bis&#8208;stannylene pincer ligand and its complexation with coinage metals (CuI, AgI and AuI) are described. All coinage metal centres are in tetrahedral coordination environments in the solid state and are exclusively coordinated by four neutral SnII donors. 119Sn NMR provided information about the behaviour in solution. All of the isolated compounds have photoluminescent properties, and these were investigated at low and elevated temperatures. Compared to the free bis&#8208;stannylene ligand, coordination to coinage metals led to an increase in the luminescence intensity. The new compounds were investigated in detail through all&#8208;electron relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>A Conformal Carbon Nanolayer Coated Fe2O3 Cocatalyst for the Promoted Activity of Plasma&#8208;Sputtered BiVO4 Photoanode</title>

Team work: Simultaneous improvement of activity and stability on BiVO4 photoanode was achieved by the simple H2 plasma treatment and a C&#8722;Fe2O3 oxygen evolution catalyst loading.







Abstract
To simultaneously improve the hole extraction ability of the BiVO4 photoanode and accelerate the surface reaction kinetics, herein, a carbon nanolayer conformally coated Fe2O3 (C&#8722;Fe2O3) as oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is loaded on the H2 plasma treated nanoporous BiVO4 (BVO(H2)) surface by a hydrothermal reaction. It is found that the H2 plasma induced vacancies in BVO remarkably increases the conductivity, and the C&#8722;Fe2O3 enables hole extraction from the bulk to the surface as well as efficient hole injection to the electrolyte. As a result, the C&#8722;Fe2O3/BVO(H2) photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 4.4&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an ABPE value of 1.5&#8201;% at 0.68&#8197;V vs. RHE, which are 4.8&#8208;fold and 13&#8208;fold higher than that of BVO photoanode, respectively.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetals and Ketals from Aldehydes and Silylenolethers without the Use of Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox catalytic cycle with an electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide (PBI) runs as long as green light is provided. The substrate silylenolethers and aldehydes enter the cycle, are oxidized to their radical cations and converted to acetals and ketals, which leave the cycle as products. Acid catalysts are not needed. Ketal and acetal groups protect the carbonyl compounds like helmets. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8208;A. Wagenknecht and D. Steuernagel (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203767).

         <title>Cyclic or linear? Parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization in silica surface prebiotic scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7 nm&#8208;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density &#8804; 0.7 nm&#8208;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5 nm&#8208;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Aurone&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;State Emissive (DSE) Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores, i.e. organic molecules showing balanced emission in both solution and as molecular solids, has recently become an emerging approach in material science, biology, sensing, and optoelectronics. However, the majority of existing DSE fluorophores represents structural modifications of the scaffolds known for their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, e.g. tetraphenylethylenes (TFE), triphenylamines (TFA), and others. In this study, we introduce aurones as an easily accessible scaffold for the construction of DSE fluorophores and describe the main design principles allowing to achieve the balanced emission in both solution and solid state. Herein, we present the solid&#8208;state fluorescence in a systematic series of aurone derivatives for the first time. We propose that the newly found DSE properties of aurones in combination with their established biological activity can be applied efficiently in biomedical studies and diagnostic tools.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations, obtained from starting neutral diradicals, have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, x&#8208;ray solid state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive/negative charged species, both residing in the same skeletal p&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence in the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and densification of Mo/Mg co&#8208;doped apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate electrolyte&#160;with enhanced ionic conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate&#8208;temperature&#160;solid oxide electrolysis cells&#160;and solid oxide full cells (IT&#8208;SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low&#160;activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Here in this work, a novel co&#8208;doping method is reported to prepare highly purified nanocrystalline powder of Mg&#8208;Mo co&#8208;doped LSO (Mg/Mo&#8208;LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+&#160;and Mg2+&#160;ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg&#8208;LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500 &#8451; for 4 h with a grain size of about 1&#8208;3 &#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the pristine LSO to 33.94 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948;&#160;at 800 &#8451;. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+&#160;doping contents was investigated systematically. The proposed Mo/Mg co&#8208;doping method&#160;is one step forward in developing apatite&#8208;structured electrolytes&#160;addressing the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable solid electrolytes.</dc:description>

As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg-LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500 &#8451; for 4 h with a grain size of about 1-3 &#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782 mS&#183;cm-1&#160;for the pristine LSO to 33.94 mS&#183;cm-1&#160;for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948;&#160;at 800 &#8451;. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+&#160;doping contents was investigated systematically. The proposed Mo/Mg co-doping method&#160;is one step forward in developing apatite-structured electrolytes&#160;addressing the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable solid electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Origin of Stereoselectivity in SE2&#8242; Reactions of Six&#8208;membered Ring Oxocarbenium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottoms up! Quantum chemical analyses of the transition states of SE2&#8242; reactions between substituted six&#8208;membered oxocarbenium ions and allyltrimethylsilane have provided quantitative insight into the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents, which dictate the stereoselectivity of the additions.







Abstract
Oxocarbenium ions are key reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. To generate a series of structure&#8208;reactivity&#8208;stereoselectivity principles for these species, we herein investigated the bimolecular electrophilic substitution reactions (SE2&#8242;) between allyltrimethylsilane and a series of archetypal six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions using a combined density functional theory (DFT) and coupled&#8208;cluster theory approach. These reactions preferentially proceed following a reaction path where the oxocarbenium ion transforms from a half chair (3H4 or 4H3) to a chair conformation. The introduction of alkoxy substituents on six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions, dramatically influences the conformational preference of the canonical 3H4 and 4H3 conformers, and thereby the stereochemical outcome of the SE2&#8242; reaction. In general, we find that the stereoselectivity in the reactions correlates to the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221; of the cations, as dictated by their shape. However, for the C5&#8208;CH2OMe substituent, steric factors override the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221;, showing a more selective reaction than expected based on the shape of the ion. Our SE2&#8242; energetics correlate well with experimentally observed stereoselectivity, and the use of the activation strain model has enabled us to quantify important interactions and structural features that occur in the transition state of the reactions to precisely understand the relative energy barriers of the diastereotopic addition reactions. The fundamental mechanistic insight provided in this study will aid in understanding the reactivity of more complex glycosyl cations featuring multiple substituents and will facilitate our general understanding of glycosylation reactions.

         <title>Engineering Sandwiched Nanochannel Aptasensor for Efficiently Screening Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was constructed for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. The structure design of nanochannel composite aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.







Abstract
Cancer cells are a class of important tumor biomarkers and are closely related to tumorous progression. It is urgent to develop a sensitive and highly efficient method for the rapid and accurate detection of cancer cells. Herein, an aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was established for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. By virtue of the porous nanochannels as the filter platform and immobilized with DNA aptamers for specifically capturing the cancer cells, the nanochannel&#8208;based electrochemical sensor denotes excellent performance for MCF&#8208;7 screening, and allowing a low limit of detection of 36&#8197;cells&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The nanochannels&#8208;based sandwich structure aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides great advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.

         <title>Funneled Depolymerization of Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Biorefinery &#8220;Heterogeneous&#8221; Lignin into Guaiacols over Reusable Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of lignin, the direct source of renewable aromatics, into value&#8208;added renewable chemicals is an important step towards sustainable biorefinery practices. Nevertheless, owing to the random heterogeneous structure and limited solubility, lignin utilization has been primarily limited to burning for energy. The catalytic depolymerization of lignin has been proposed and demonstrated as a viable route to sustainable biorefinery, however, low yields and poor selectivity of products, high char formation, and limited to no recycling of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst involved in lignin depolymerization demands attention to enable practical&#8208;scale lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study, we demonstrate the catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery poplar lignin into guaiacols over a reusable zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst. The essence of the study lies in the high conversion (&gt;80%), minimum char formation (7&#8208;16%), high yields of guaiacols (up to 200 mg / g of lignin), and catalyst reusability. Both solid residue, liquid stream, and gaseous products were thoroughly characterized using ICP&#8208;OES, PXRD, CHN analysis, GC&#8208;MS, GPC, and 2D NMR to understand the hydrogenolysis pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters using a DNA Scaffold.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein investigated chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on D&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds were prepared containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives. The homo dimers of 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here will lead to development bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Synthesis of TPE&#8208;Based Fluorophores Derived by &#960;&#8208;Extended Systems: Opposite Mechanofluorochromism, Anti&#8208;counterfeiting and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although remarkable progresses are achieved in the design and development of the mono&#8208;shift in photoluminescence for mechanofluorochromic materials, it is still a severe challenge to explore the opposite mechanofluorochromic materials with both blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence. Herein, two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(TPE)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behaviour. Under UV lamp, the color of pristine X&#8208;1 changed from blue to green with reversible red&#8208;shifted 27 nm in fluorescence emission spectra after ground, while the color of pristine X&#8208;2 changed from red to yellow with reversible blue&#8208;shifted 74 nm after ground. The detailed characterizations (including PXRD, SEM and DSC) confirmed that this opposite mechanofluorochromism was attributed to the transformation of order&#8208;crystalline and amorphous states. The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking mode by inducd &#960;&#8208;extended systems. In addition, these TPE&#8208;based Fluorophores (X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2) exhibited excellent bio&#8208;compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio&#8208;imaging, writable data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction with enhanced carriers separation and transfer for photocatalytic methane oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic methane oxidation to oxygenates with promising performance remains as a grand challenge due to the low productivity and severe overoxidation. Herein, SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction was developed for photocatalytic methane oxidation with O2 to liquid oxygenates products at mild reaction conditions. The optimized SrWO4/TiO2 catalyst exhibited high productivity of 13365&#160;&#956;mol/g with high selectivity of 98.7% for oxygenates. Benefited from the intimate heterojunction interface of SrWO4/TiO2, the constructed &#8544;&#8208;type heterostructure improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, and a high&#8208;speed transfer channel for photogenerated carriers was fabricated. Simultaneously, the special band structure can increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO2 surface, which promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species to enhance liquid oxygenates productivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Lewis Pairs Yield Diradicaloids and Enable Modular Control of the Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable metal&#8208;free diradicaloids are fascinating compounds, typically based on covalent polycyclic or nitrogen&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks. Unfortunately, their preparation and the modulation of their diradical character require substantial synthetic efforts. The present work introduces a synthetic approach to diradicaloids by the ease and modularity of Lewis pair formation. Binding redox&#8208;active bis(catecholato)silane Lewis acids to ditopic tetraoxolene Lewis bases yields adducts with varying spin ground states. Computational analyses disclose that the diradical character increases with the electron donor ability of the catechols and the electron accepting ability of the tetraoxolene. Hence, this protocol grants access to diradicaloids with rationally adjustable diradical character of high potential for numerous applications in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaryl&#8208;Substituted Bis&#8208;Anils: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Derivatives with Tunable ESIPT Emission Color and pH Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives is described which present aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step synthesis, structural, and photophysical properties of a series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives presenting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process is described. The fluorescence color of the aggregates can be fine tuned by changing the electronic nature of the peripheral substitution, leading to a wide range of emission wavelengths (from green to the near infra&#8208;red). Moreover, upon introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as cyano (CN), a competition between ESIPT and deprotonation is observed leading to the emission of the anionic species at low water percentage. This observation led to the synthesis of an additional mixed AIE fluorophore, functionalized by methoxy groups on one side and cyano groups on the other side. Upon addition of water, this dye displays first anionic emission, followed by typical AIE/ESIPT red fluorescence upon formation of the aggregates. TD&#8208;DFT calculations on selected AIE dyes were performed to rationalize the nature of the emissive transitions in these derivatives.

Ring contraction: m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were synthesized as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins with Pd coordination ability. PdII complexes of these carbaporphyrins exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands and small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps despite their small &#960;&#8208;electronic networks, probably due to the extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were prepared as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins. While m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was unstable, m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was fairly stable. Both of their PdII complexes showed distorted coordination structures with extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds. As compared with the reported m&#8208;benziporphyrin PdII complexes, these PdII complexes showed considerably small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps, despite their smaller molecular size. PdII metalation of the m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) dimer gave the corresponding PdII complex, which showed similar distorted coordination and a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Finally, PdII metalation of a pyrene&#8208;sharing formal p&#8208;benziporphyrin(1.1.1.1) dimer gave a nonaromatic PdII dimer, which rearranged to an aromatic PdII complex upon treatment with alumina.

         <title>Hierarchically Organized Cocrystal of Tetra&#8208;Anionic Porphyrin and Di&#8208;Cationic Viologen: Ion Conformations, Supramolecule Interactions, and Porphyrin Arrays</title>

         <dc:description>
A hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+) is reported, wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique J&#8208;type porphyrin arrays. The crystal incorporates six ionic conformations which lead to intricate supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Ionic co&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;anionic porphyrins has been extensively researched in the construction of hierarchically organized architectures with potential application value in organic semiconductors, sunlight catalysts and supramolecular chirality systems. However, such architectures are difficult to grow to a size suitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD); the lack of single&#8208;crystal structures of these architectures leads to challenges in gaining deeper comprehension about that. This study reports a hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+), wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique porphyrin arrays; the spectrum characteristics and calculated coulombic exciton coupling energy show that these porphyrin arrays are J&#8208;aggregates. We prove that the distortion of porphyrin ring of TSPP4&#8722; strongly correlates with the deflection of its phenyl groups. The crystal comprises six different ionic conformations, and the multiplicity of ionic conformation leads to intricate supramolecular interactions.

         <title>An Efficient, Site&#8208;Selective and Spontaneous Peptide Macrocyclisation During in&#8197;vitro Translation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclisation approach for peptides, derived from in&#8197;vitro translation, is developed that is highly selective for N&#8208;terminal cysteines. This approach allows other cysteine residues to be exploited for further peptide diversification. A model peptide showed a large impact from this cyclisation on binding and biological activity, and molecular dynamics was used to illustrate how this cyclisation change can influence peptide conformation.







Abstract
Macrocyclisation provides a means of stabilising the conformation of peptides, often resulting in improved stability, selectivity, affinity, and cell permeability. In this work, a new approach to peptide macrocyclisation is reported, using a cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;containing amino acid that can be incorporated into peptides by both in&#8197;vitro translation and solid phase peptide synthesis, meaning it should be applicable to peptide discovery by mRNA display. This cyclisation proceeds rapidly, with minimal by&#8208;products, is selective over other amino acids including non N&#8208;terminal cysteines, and is compatible with further peptide elaboration exploiting such an additional cysteine in bicyclisation and derivatisation reactions. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the new cyclisation group is likely to influence the peptide conformation as compared to previous thioether&#8208;based approaches, through rigidity and intramolecular aromatic interactions, illustrating their complementarity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by a De Novo Designed Metalloprotein that Undergoes Ni&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo H2 evolving metallopeptide is constructed from first principles, which undergoes oligomerization change in the presence of NiII. Under white light, the metallopeptide produces H2 via a reductive quenching pathway. The timescales of ET and the role of thiol pKa is determined from TAS kinetics and pH titration experiments, respectively. Outer sphere steric modulation shows preferential binding of H+ to Ni from N&#8208;termini.







Abstract
De novo metalloprotein design involves the construction of proteins guided by specific repeat patterns of polar and apolar residues, which, upon self&#8208;assembly, provide a suitable environment to bind metals and produce artificial metalloenzymes. While a wide range of functionalities have been realized in de novo designed metalloproteins, the functional repertoire of such constructs towards alternative energy&#8208;relevant catalysis is currently limited. Here we show the application of de novo approach to design a functional H2 evolving protein. The design involved the assembly of an amphiphilic peptide featuring cysteines at tandem a/d sites of each helix. Intriguingly, upon NiII addition, the oligomers shift from a major trimeric assembly to a mix of dimers and trimers. The metalloprotein produced H2 photocatalytically with a bell&#8208;shape pH dependence, having a maximum activity at pH&#8197;5.5. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to determine the timescales of electron transfer as a function of pH. Selective outer sphere mutations are made to probe how the local environment tunes activity. A preferential enhancement of activity is observed via steric modulation above the NiII site, towards the N&#8208;termini, compared to below the NiII site towards the C&#8208;termini.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs): Synthesis, Crystallization, and Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks have received great attention as an attractive photocatalyst owing to their unique structure characteristics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallization, and applications for photocatalytic water splitting. The perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are also discussed.







Abstract
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have received great attention from academia owing to their unique structure characteristics such as nitrogen&#8208;rich structure, chemical stability, fully conjugated skeleton and high surface area; all these unique properties make CTFs attractive for widespread applications, especially for photocatalytic applications. In this review, we aim to provide recent advances in the CTFs preparation, and mainly focus on their photocatalytic applications. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallinity lifting strategies, and their applications for photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, a brief background including the photocatalytic water splitting and crystallinity are provided. Then, synthetic methods related to CTFs and the strategies for enhancing the crystallinity are summarized and compared. After that, the general photocatalytic mechanism and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance of CTFs are discussed. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are discussed, inspiring the development of CTF materials in photocatalytic applications.

One pot, many products: A novel method is reported for the general synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazins and 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines by FeIII&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols. The hall&#8208;marks of the method are the use of low&#8208;cost substrates and an environmentally benign iron catalyst, high tolerance towards various functional groups, and switchable product formation.







Abstract
We report herein unprecedented cascade reactions of O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;amino phenols with 10&#8197;mol% FeCl3 in DCE at room temperature for 0.67&#8211;3&#8197;h to form spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with 38&#8211;89&#8201;% yield. Replacing the substrates&#8217; oxygen atom by a N&#8208;tosylimine group followed by treatment with the same catalyst and solvent at 80&#8201;&#176;C produced 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines in 12&#8211;20&#8197;h with up to 62&#8201;% yield. Mechanistic understanding provided an insight into the transformations. The use of simple substrates and an environmentally benign low&#8208;cost catalyst, broad substrate scope and tolerance of diverse functional groups makes the methodology inherently attractive.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation in the Gas Phase: Spectroscopic Characterization of C&#8722;N Coupling in the V3C++N2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of V3C+ with N2 is studied using IRPD spectroscopy. The cleavage of N&#8801;N bond and the subsequent C&#8722;N coupling is undoubtedly confirmed by the observed IR&#8208;active C=N stretching fundamental in the fingerprint region of the vibrational action spectrum. This work represents the first spectroscopic observation of the formed C&#8722;N bond directly from N2 in gas phase.







Abstract
We report on cluster&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N bond formation in the gas phase using N2 as a nitrogen source. The V3C++N2 reaction is studied by a combination of ion&#8208;trap mass spectrometry with infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and complemented by electronic structure calculations. The proposed reaction mechanism is spectroscopically validated by identifying the structures of the reactant and product ions. V3C+ exhibits a pyramidal structure of C1&#8208;symmetry. N2 activation is initiated by adsorption in an end&#8208;on fashion at a vanadium site, followed by spontaneous cleavage of the N&#8801;N triple bond and subsequent C&#8722;N coupling. The IRPD spectrum of the metal nitride product [NV3(C=N)]+ exhibits characteristic C=N double bond (1530&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and V&#8722;N single bond (770, 541 and 522&#8197;cm&#8722;1) stretching bands.

         <title>Oxychalcogenides: A Promising Class of Materials for Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Mixed&#8208;Anion Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The best of all worlds: Oxychalcogenides, promising IR NLO materials candidates, can integrate the property superiority of different anion groups, for example, the strong SHG response and wide IR transmission of metal chalcogenides and the large band gap and high laser damage threshold of oxides.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are of great significance in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials remains a huge challenge due to the conflict between the necessary properties required for NLO materials. Notably, oxychalcogenides with mixed&#8208;anion groups have drawn extensive interest as a family of important IR NLO candidates because they integrate the property advantages of oxides and chalcogenides by chemical substitution engineering. In this review, we provide a survey of reported oxychalcogenides and aim to present the development of NLO oxychalcogenides from the perspective of rational design of their structural chemistry. Furthermore, we focus on the relationships between partial substitution and structural symmetry as well as optical properties. These provide some helpful guidance for the further exploration and design of novel oxychalcogenide materials with excellent NLO performance in the future.

         <title>Molecular Insights into Bifunctional Ambruticin DH3 for Substrate Specificity and Catalytic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The theoretical study uncovers both the structural rationale for substrate specificity of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AsmDH3 and a complete one&#8208;base catalytic mechanism including dehydration and cyclization.







Abstract
Dehydratase (DH), a domain located at polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, commonly catalyzes the dehydration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl intermediate. As a unique bifunctional dehydratase, AmbDH3 (the DH domain of module 3 of the ambruticin PKS) is verified to be responsible for both dehydration and the following pyran&#8208;forming cyclization. Besides, in&#8197;vitro studies showed that its catalytic efficiency varies with different chiral substrates. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AmbDH3 remains unclear. In this work, the structural rationale for the substrate specificity (2R/2S&#8208; and 6R/6S&#8208;substrates) in AmbDH3 was elucidated and the complete reaction pathways including dehydration and cyclization were presented. Both MD simulations and binding free energy calculations indicated AmbDH3 had a stronger preference for 2R&#8208;substrates (2R6R&#8208;2, 2R6S&#8208;3) than 2S&#8208;substrates (2S6R&#8208;1), and residue H51 and G61 around the catalytic pocket were emphasized by forming stable hydrogen bonds with 2R&#8208;substrates. In addition, AmbDH3&#8217;s mild tolerance at C6 was explained by comparison of substrate conformation and hydrogen bond network in 6S&#8208; and 6R&#8208;substrate systems. The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one&#8208;base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for 2R6S&#8208;3 substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 24.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran&#8208;containing products.

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination of Chiral API Molecules by MicroED Analysis of Cocrystal Powders Formed Based on Cocrystal Propensity Prediction Calculations
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and robust pipeline for absolute configuration determination is presented here. First, virtual screening selects chiral probes compatible with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Second, crystallization trials produce microcrystals suitable for analysis without further optimization. Finally, MicroED is used to determine the crystal structure. The absolute configuration of the API can be confidently assigned relative to the chiral probe.







Abstract
Establishing the absolute configuration of chiral active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is of great importance. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) has traditionally been the method of choice for such analysis, but scXRD requires the growth of large crystals, which can be challenging. Here, we present a method for determining absolute configuration that does not rely on the growth of large crystals. By examining microcrystals formed with chiral probes (small chiral compounds such as amino acids), absolute configuration can be unambiguously determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). Our streamlined method employs three steps: (1) virtual screening to identify promising chiral probes, (2) experimental cocrystal screening and (3) structure determination by MicroED and absolute configuration assignment. We successfully applied this method to analyze two chiral API molecules currently on the market for which scXRD was not used to determine absolute configuration.

         <dc:description>Mycobacteria&#160;are covered in a thick layer of different polysaccharides that helps to avert the innate immune response.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Sulfoxidation Catalyzed by a Photoswitchable Iron Salen Phosphate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe a photoswitchable iron(III) salen phosphate catalyst, which is able to catalyze the enantiodivergent oxidation of prochiral aryl alkyl sulfides to chiral aryl alkyl sulfoxides. The stable (S)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst produced enantioenriched sulfoxides with the (R)&#8208;configuration in up to 75% e.e., whereas the photoisomerized metastable (R)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst favored the formation of (S)&#8208;sulfoxides in up to 43% e.e. The maximum &#916;e.e. value obtained in the enantiodivergent sulfoxidation was 118%, which is identical to the maximum &#916;e.e. value that was measured in the enantiodivergent epoxidation of alkenes by a related recently described Mn1 catalyst. This iron&#8208;based catalyst broadens the scope of photoswitchable enantiodivergent catalysts and may use in the future to develop a photoswitchable catalytic system that can write digital information on a polymer chain in the form chiral sulfoxide functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Styrene Oxide Isomerase&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement in Cascade Biotransformations: Synthesis of Chiral and/or Natural Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of aryl epoxides to carbonyl compounds via a 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;shift in a stereospecific manner. A number of cascade biotransformations with SOI&#8208;catalyzed epoxide isomerization as a key step have been developed to convert readily available substrates into valuable chiral chemicals. Cascade conversion of terminal or internal alkenes into chiral acids, alcohols or amines were achieved, which involved SOI&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive isomerization of terminal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;H shift, or internal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;methyl shift. SOI&#8208;involved cascades were also developed to convert racemic epoxides into chiral acids or amines via dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, combining SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization with enantioselective C&#8211;C bond forming enzymes enabled the synthesis of chiral amino acids or amino alcohols from racemic epoxides. Finally, integration of SOI&#8208;involved cascades with biosynthesis pathways allowed for the direct utilization of renewable substrates for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value natural chemicals such as alcohols, acids and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atropisomerism Study of Large Cycloarylenes: [n]Cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;Pyrenylenes&#8217; Case</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An atropisomerism of large cycloarylenes was studied using [n]cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes (n = 6&#8211;21) as an illustrative example with two simple assumptions: (1) alternating configurations (R,S,R,S,,,) are thermodynamically most stable, and (2) three consecutive identical configurations (R,R,R or S,S,S) are prevented. Ni&#8208;mediated coupling of a 5,9&#8208;diiodopyrene gave a series of directly&#8208;linked cyclic pyrene oligomers in one&#8208;pot reaction. As&#8208;synthesized cyclic hexamer was assigned as an (R,S,S,R,R,S) structure, converted into an (R,S,R,S,R,S)&#8208;form upon heating. Cyclic heptamer consists of two types of C2 symmetric structures predicted from assumption (2), one of which was convergent to one another by heating. Three atropisomers of cyclic octamer were analyzed from the possible five candidates by means of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the conversion process to (R,S,R,S,R,S,R,S) configurations upon heating was investigated. In total, according to two simple rules, the analysis of atropisomerism could be performed smoothly.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are an emerging class of amphiphilic antimicrobial compounds with a modular molecular framework suitable for simple chemical derivatization. Here, a series of COE derivatives with a stilbene conjugated segment and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) pendant groups was designed and synthesized to understand how lipophilic cationic groups impact antimicrobial activity. In vitro evaluations against ESKAPE pathogens showed broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and mycobacteria, with TPP groups enhancing antimicrobial activity towards clinically&#8208;relevant Gram&#8208;negative strains compared to their ammonium analogues. We studied the interactions of DM6P, the most active TPP&#8208;COE compound, with various membrane assays. Treatment of bacterial cells with DM6P showed enhanced permeability of cell membranes without inducing significant bacterial resistance development. Moreover, DM6P eliminated 99.99% of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) in an in vivo wound model. These results represent a promising chemical strategy for increasing the activity spectrum of membrane&#8208;active COE antibiotics to tackle challenging drug&#8208;resistant targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Trends in Closed&#8208;loop Recycling Polymers: Monomer Design and Catalytic Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are indispensable materials in modern society; however, their extensive use has contributed to the depletion of finite natural resources and caused severe environmental issues. One end&#8208;of&#8208;use solution for plastics involves the chemical recycling of polymers back to monomers for repolymerization to virgin polymers without changing the material properties, allowing the establishment of a circular material economy. This concept focuses on the critical advantages of chemically recyclable polymers in terms of monomer design, material properties, and the feasibility of bulk depolymerization. The recyclability via bulk thermolysis of various polyesters, CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates, and polyacetals produced via ring&#8208;opening polymerization is highlighted through discussions regarding rational monomer design and efficient catalyst development. An outlook and perspective are provided to delineate the future challenges in the rational design of monomer and polymer structures that deliver the desired materials performance while being suitable for bulk thermolysis with high (de)polymerization activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation by Bio&#8208;Functional Molecules for Efficient and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for planar&#8208;type perovskite solar cells by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is provided. Cobalamin could chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation.







Abstract
Among the factors that lead to the reduction of the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) the difficulty involved in realizing a high&#8208;quality film and the efficient charge transfer that takes place at the interface between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite is worth mentioning. Here, a strategy for planar&#8208;type devices by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is demonstrated. Having systematically investigated the effects of SnO2@B12 interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, it can be concluded that cobalamin can chemically link the SnO2 layer and the perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation. Utilizing SnO2@B12 improves the efficiency of planar&#8208;type PSCs by 20.60&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 250&#8197;h of exposure to an ambient atmosphere, unsealed PSCs containing SnO2@B12 degrade by 10&#8201;%. This research provides a viable method for developing bio&#8208;functional molecules that will increase the effectiveness and durability of planar&#8208;perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the interest in polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds has steadily increased as the versatility of these in material science are explored, for example in fluorescent probes and pyroelectronics. In this concept, recent advances in organocatalysed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a synthetic tool to access novel polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds are demonstrated.







Abstract
Cycloadditions are an important class of reactions in materials science for the construction of polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds. Recently, cycloadditions have been expanded beyond the &#8220;classical&#8221; group of cycloadditions involving six &#960;&#8208;electrons, and it is now possible to control cycloadditions for an extended number of &#960;&#8208;electrons by applying organocatalysis. This novel field of cycloadditions&#8211;termed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions&#8211;allows new synthetic methodologies to construct polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heteroaromatic compounds in two or three dimensions. This concept presents higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a method for accessing two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional azulenes and cyclazines, as well as three dimensional indenes, as polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds.

         <title>Precise Control of Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly by Light and Electricity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8208;inspired synthetic dissipative self&#8208;assemblies have attracted much attention recently. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self&#8208;contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self&#8208;assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self&#8208;contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self&#8208;assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly. Through programming the two counteracting fuels, we demonstrated the control of PBIg self&#8208;assembly into a variety of assembly morphologies in a self&#8208;contained system. In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self&#8208;assembly of self&#8208;contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bringing Machine&#8208;Learning Enhanced Quantum Chemistry and Microwave Spectroscopy to Conformational Landscape Exploration: the Paradigmatic Case of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Threonine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study has been carried out on 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine, the only naturally occurring fluorinated amino acid. Fluorination of the methyl group significantly increases the conformational complexity with respect to the parent amino acid threonine. The conformational landscape has been characterized in great detail, with special attention given to the inter&#8208;conversion pathways between different conformers. This led to the identification of 13 stable low&#8208;energy minima. The equilibrium population of so many conformers produces a very complicated and congested rotational spectrum that could be assigned through a strategy that combines several levels of quantum chemical calculations with the principles of machine learning. Twelve conformers out of 13 could be experimentally characterized. The results obtained from the analysis of the intra&#8208;molecular interactions can be exploited to accurately model fluorine&#8208;substitution effects in biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Fluorescent Probes Targeting Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor on the Cell Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a glycolipid&#8208;anchored protein located on the cell surface that is implicated in the promotion of metastasis. New fluorescent probes for the detection of uPAR expression that feature a rapid &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response are here reported. They consist of a donor&#8208;p&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based fluorophore conjugated with a uPAR&#8208;binding AE105 peptide. The resulting AE105&#8208;coupled uPAR&#8208;targeting probes are weakly emissive in aqueous buffer solutions; however, a fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signal is instantly triggered upon specific binding to uPAR (KD = 63.2 nM for P1 and 49.5 nM for P2), which restricts the rotational deactivation of the fluorophore. Applications of the probes were demonstrated in the imaging of uPAR overexpressed on the membrane of cancer cell and in a cell&#8208;based uPAR inhibitor assay.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8208;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8208;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate using Heterogenized Hydrophilic Manganese Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable catalysts: Heterogeneous Mn&#8208;porphyrin molecular electrocatalysts are used to efficiently reduce CO2 to acetate in an aqueous environment with a selectivity of 62&#8201;% when immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode using a one&#8208;pot electrografting method. The vertical alignment and higher loading of the electrografted molecules is enabled by the hydrophilic sulfonate groups.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate climate change. Metalloporphyrins have been used as a promising class of stable and tunable catalysts for the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) but have been primarily restricted to single&#8208;carbon reduction products. Here, we utilize functionalized earth&#8208;abundant manganese tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;TPP) molecular electrocatalysts that have been immobilized via electrografting onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to convert CO2 with overall 94&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, with 62&#8201;% being converted to acetate. Tuning of Mn&#8208;TPP with electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonate groups (Mn&#8208;TPPS) introduced mechanistic changes arising from the electrostatic interaction between the sulfonate groups and water molecules, resulting in better surface coverage, which facilitated higher conversion rates than the non&#8208;functionalized Mn&#8208;TPP. For Mn&#8208;TPP only carbon monoxide and formate were detected as CO2 reduction products. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the additional sulfonate groups could alter the C&#8722;C coupling pathway from *CO&#8594;*COH&#8594;*COH&#8208;CO to *CO&#8594;*CO&#8208;CO&#8594;*COH&#8208;CO, reducing the free energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling in the case of Mn&#8208;TPPS. This opens a new approach to designing metalloporphyrin catalysts for two carbon products in CO2RR.

         <title>Quantum Yield of DNA Strand Breaks under Photoexcitation of a Molecular Ruby</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) used for treating cancer relies on the generation of highly reactive oxygen species, e.g. singlet oxygen 1O2, by light&#8208;induced excitation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of molecular oxygen, inducing DNA damage in close proximity of the PS. Although many precious metal complexes have been explored as PS for PDT and received clinical approval, only recently, the potential of photoactive complexes of bio&#8208;essential metals as PS was discovered. Using the DNA origami technology that can absolutely quantify DNA strand break cross sections, we assessed the potential of the luminescent transition metal complex [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd = N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) to damage DNA in an air&#8208;saturated aqueous environment upon low energy UV/Vis illumination. The quantum yield for strand breakage, i.e., the ratio of DNA strand breaks to the number of absorbed photons, was determined to 1 &#8211; 4%, indicating efficient transformation of photons into DNA strand breaks by [Cr(ddpd)2]3+.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of sterically encumbered alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides applying the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. For the synthesis of bulky amides alternative strategies are required and in the past, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups have been used to ease metalation reactions. The in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation in stirred suspensions of magnesium or calcium with hydryl halide and imine in THF allows the synthesis of a plethora of amides with bulky silyl&#8208;free substituents. Ball milling protocols partially favor competitive side reactions such as aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reactions. Calcium is the advantageous choice for the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation and subsequent addition onto the imines yielding bulky calcium bis(amides) whereas the stronger reducing heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metals strontium and barium are less selective and hence, the aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reaction becomes competitive. Exemplary, the solid&#8208;state molecular structures of [(Et2O)Mg(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] and [(Et2O)2Ca(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] have been determined.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Al/P and Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs towards heterocumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLP) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (Bis = CH(SiMe3)2, 1) and tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (2) were reacted with the heterocumulenes PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2 and PhNSO as well as SO2. With isocyanate and cyanate, both 1 and 2, form addition products under formation of five&#8208;membered rings. With CS2, isothiocyanate and sulfinylaniline only 1 forms stable adducts, while 2 shows reactivity towards sulfinylaniline but the product decomposed after several minutes. The reaction of 1 with SO2 led to a partial cleavage of the P&#8208;O&#8208;Al and Al&#8208;C units, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of 2 with SO2 affords the 1,2&#8208;addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and CHN analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalenes Fused with Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid molecules of &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbon rings and BN&#8208;heterocyclic rings (h&#8208;CBNs) fused with each other have been a rare class of compounds due to the limited availability of their synthetic methods. Here we report the synthesis of new h&#8208;CBNs (1, Figure 1d) featuring a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wings. Using 1,2&#8208;azaborinine derivatives as a building block, we developed a rational synthetic protocol that allows the formation of a B4N4 ring in a stepwise manner, resulting in the fully fused ABA&#8208;type triblock molecules. Thus, three derivatives of 1 bearing naphthalene (1Naph), anthracene (1Anth), or phenanthrene (1Phen) wings fused with the B4N4 core were synthesized and characterized. Among them, 1Phen which displays the highest triplet&#8208;state energy was found to serve a host material for phosphorescent OLED devices, for which a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.7% was recorded. These findings may promote the synthesis of various types of h&#8208;CBNs aiming at new properties arising from the synergy of two different &#960;&#8208;electronic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Piezochromism from o&#8208;Carborane Dyad: Boron&#8208;Clusters Facilitating Wide&#8208;Range Redshift and High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75 nm and a sensitivity of 19.1 nm&#8226;GPa&#8208;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131 nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8 nm&#8226;GPa&#8208;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.</dc:description>

Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Helicene&#8208;Containing Arenes for Optical Limiting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A helicene&#8208;containing arene and its linear analogue have been successfully synthesized and characterized, where the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the former can arrange in an offset packing style with a &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap. The introduction of pentagon&#8208;rings into the parent skeletons in the resulting compounds can boost the stability, and such helicene&#8208;containing molecule possesses higher solubility in organic solvent than the linear analogue. The structural difference has significantly influenced the optical limiting performance. The former in solution and in doped gel glass presents higher optical limiting response towards 532 nm laser than the latter. This study can enrich the functionalization of helicene, which can possess a positive effect in terms of nonlinear optical property.</dc:description>

Owing to the planar conjugated structures of the hexaphenyltriphenylene skeleton, such metallacages show good host&#8722;guest complexation with a series of emissive dyes,&#160; which have been further used to tune their emission in solution. Interestingly, based on their complementary emission colors, white light emission is achieved in a mixture of the host metallacages and the guests.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using the in situ generated triarylamine radical cation as an initiator, the sp3 C&#8208;H bond of proline esters was smoothly oxidized and brominated through C&#8208;H activation relay (CHAR), giving a series of 4&#8208;bromopyrroles in good yields with high regioselectivity.

         <title>Thermally Activated vs. Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reactions &#8211; a Tale of Three Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular processes behind hydrogen evolution reactions can be quite complex. In macroscopic electrochemical cells, it is extremely difficult to elucidate and understand their mechanism. Gas phase models, consisting of a metal ion and a small number of water molecules, provide unique opportunities to understand the reaction pathways in great detail. Hydrogen evolution in clusters consisting of a singly charged metal ion and one to on the order of 50 water molecules has been studied extensively for magnesium, aluminum and vanadium. Such clusters with around 10&#8211;20 water molecules are known to eliminate atomic or molecular hydrogen upon mild activation by room temperature black&#8208;body radiation. Irradiation with ultraviolet light, however, enables hydrogen evolution already with a single water molecule. Here, we analyze and compare the reaction mechanisms for hydrogen evolution on the ground state as well as excited state potential energy surfaces. Five distinct mechanisms for evolution of atomic or molecular hydrogen are identified and characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Cationic Cyclizations Involving Alkynes: a Computational Study on Biomimetic Synthesis of Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational studies on the electrophilic cyclization between alkynes and transient carbocations or Lewis acid activated epoxides show that the regiochemistry of the reaction depends on the terminal or internal position of the triple bond. Reactants possessing terminal alkynyl groups lead to six&#8208;membered rings whereas internal alkynes yield five&#8208;membered rings via 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig electrophilic cyclizations, respectively. The regiochemistry of the reaction is not determined by two&#8208;electron interactions, but by minimization of Pauli repulsion. This scenario is preserved in related biomimetic reactions leading to steroid scaffolds. In this latter case, the stereochemistry of the cyclization reaction is oriented towards the formation of equatorial C&#8208;C bonds connecting the new six&#8208;six&#8208; and six&#8208;five&#8208;membered fused rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether&#8208;Based Ion Transporters in Bilayer Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bilayer membranes that enhance the stability of the cell are essential for cell survival, separating and protecting the interior of the cell from its external environment. Membrane&#8208;based channel proteins are crucial for sustaining cellular activities. However, dysfunction of these proteins would induce serial channelopathies, which could be substituted by artificial ion channel analogs. Crown ethers (CEs) are widely studied in the area of artificial ion channels owing to their intrinsic host&#8208;guest interaction with different kinds of organic and inorganic ions. Other advantages such as lower price, chemical stability, and easier modification also make CE a research hotspot in the field of synthetic transmembrane nanopores. And numerous CEs&#8208;based membrane&#8208;active synthetic ion channels were designed and fabricated in the past decades. Herein, the recent progress of CEs&#8208;based synthetic ion transporters has been comprehensively summarized in this review, including their design principles, functional mechanisms, controllable properties, and biomedical applications. Furthermore, this review has been concluded by discussing the future opportunities and challenges facing this research field. It is anticipated that this review could offer some inspiration for the future fabrication of novel CEs&#8208;derived ion transporters with more advanced structures, properties, and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward water&#8208;gas shift reaction: a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction offers a dominating path to hydrogen generation from fossil fuel, in which heterogeneous metal catalysts play a crucial part in this course. In this review, we highlighted and summarized recent developments on theoretical calculations of metal catalysts developed to date, including surface structure (e.g., monometallic and polymetallic systems) and interface structure (e.g., supported catalysts and metal oxide composites), with special emphasis on the characteristics of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy, and metal&#8208;support interaction. A systematic summarization on reaction mechanism was performed, including redox mechanism, associative mechanism as well as hybrid mechanism; the development on chemical kinetics (e.g., molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo and microkinetic simulation) was then introduced. At the end, we discussed the challenges associated with theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward WGS reaction and provided some perspectives on the future advance of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation, Structure&#8208;Performance Relationship, and Reaction Network of ZnZSM&#8208;5 for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene (C2H4) is a major chemical for the modern society, and new technologies for its production are of strategic importance globally. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C2H4 production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attentions. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM&#8208;5 supported Zn system, i.e. ZnZSM&#8208;5, which showed great promise in CO2&#8208;ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM&#8208;5 at 700 oC and a CO2:C2H6 feeding ratio of 5:1. During 340 min TOS, the C2H6 conversion decreased moderately from 36.2 to 23.1%, and the C2H4 yield stabilized at 21.9 to 27.9%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A &#8216;top down&#8217; scaffold remodelling approach to library synthesis was applied to spirotricyclic ureas prepared by a complexity&#8208;generating oxidative dearomatisation. Eighteen structurally&#8208;distinct, sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds were accessed from the parent tricycle through ring addition, cleavage and expansion strategies. Biological screening of a small compound library based on these scaffolds using the cell&#8208;painting assay demonstrated distinctive phenotypic responses engendered by different library members, illustrating the functional as well as structural diversity of the compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decade, compounds bearing a stereogenic C&#8211; N axis have gained significant attention ranging from ligand to drug design. Yet, the atroposelective synthesis of these molecules remains a considerable challenge. In contrast to recent methods utilizing more advanced chiral catalysts, a most simply accessed Jacobsen&#8208;type Chromium(III)&#8208;salen complex was herein utilized as chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Mild reaction conditions afforded various 5&#8208;Hydroxybenzo[g]indoles with up to 97% yield. Moreover, through a simple work&#8208;up, very high enantiomeric excesses of up to 99% could be obtained.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The compound Ge32Co9&#8722;x (x&#160;=&#160;0.54(6), a&#160;=&#160;10.9861(3) &#197;, space group Im&#8208;3m) was prepared by high&#8208;pressure at high&#8208;temperature and is metastable at ambient conditions. It crystallizes in a new structure type, Pearson symbol cI82&#8208;1.08. The crystal structure represents a slightly distorted cubic primitive arrangement of germanium atoms with part of the Ge cubes filled by cobalt. Analysis of the chemical bonding by real space methods reveals three&#8208;core cluster units Ge16Co3 and seemingly empty regions comprising either covalent inter&#8208;polyhedral Ge&#8208;Ge bonds or lone&#8208;pairs located at the germanium atoms. The electrical conductivity is metal&#8208;like.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Aliphatic Fluoropeptides: Perspectives on Folding Properties, Membrane Partition and Proteolytic Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A de novo designed class of peptide&#8208;based fluoropolymers composed of fluorinated aliphatic amino acids as main components is reported. Structural characterization provided insights into fluorine&#8208;induced alterations on &#946;&#8208;strand to &#945;&#8208;helix transition upon an increase in SDS content and revealed the unique formation of PPII structures for trifluorinated fluoropeptides. A combination of circular dichroism, fluorescence&#8208;based leaking assays and surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy served to examine the insertion and folding processes into unilamellar vesicles. While partitioning into lipid bilayers, the degree of fluorination conducts a decrease in &#945;&#8208;helical content. Furthermore, this study comprises a report on the proteolytic stability of peptides exclusively built up by fluorinated amino acids and proved all sequences to be enzymatically degradable despite the degree of fluorination. Herein presented fluoropeptides as well as the distinctive properties of these artificial and polyfluorinated foldamers with enzyme&#8208;degradable features will play a crucial role in the future development of fluorinated peptide&#8208;based biomaterials</dc:description>

         <title>Ketyl Radicals Generated from Magnesium(I) Compounds: Useful Reagents for C&#8210;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aryl ketones, 9&#8208;fluorenone (fluor), 9&#8208;xanthenone (xanth) and 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone (anth), were reacted with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac = [HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8208;, Ar = mesityl (Mes) or 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dip)). This gave stable magnesium ketyl complexes which are monomeric, [(ArNacnac)(DMAP)Mg(fluor&#183;)] (Ar = Mes or Dip, DMAP = 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) and [(MesNacnac)Mg(xanth&#183;)(xanth)]; dimeric, [{(MesNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;fluor&#183;)}2], or tetrameric, [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;anth&#183;)}4]. In contrast, di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone (OCPy2) is doubly reduced with [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2] (Xyl = xylyl) to give a diamagnetic alkoxy/amido complex, [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OCPy2)]. These complexes have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and in three cases, EPR spectroscopy. Regioselective C&#8210;C hetero&#8208;coupling reactions between magnesium ketyls and phenanthroline (phen) have yielded the alkoxy compounds, [(MesNacnac)Mg(OCR2&#8208;2&#8208;phen)] (OCR2 = xanth, OCPh2 or OC(Ph)(2&#8208;Me&#8208;Ph)). In addition, homo&#8208; C&#8208;C couplings of the enones, chalcone (chalc) and dibenziylideneactetone (DBA), using magnesium(I) reducing agents, have afforded dimagnesium enolates, [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;chalc2)] (Ar = Mes or Xyl) and [{(DipNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;DBA2)]. A pinacol coupling reaction between [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] and 2&#8208;adamantanone (OAd) yielded [{(DipNacnac)(OAd)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OAd2)], presumably via a ketyl intermediate. This study further highlights the utility magnesium(I) compounds have as selective reducing agents in organic transformations.</dc:description>

These complexes have been characterized by X-ray crystallography, and in three cases, EPR spectroscopy. Regioselective C&#8210;C hetero-coupling reactions between magnesium ketyls and phenanthroline (phen) have yielded the alkoxy compounds, [(MesNacnac)Mg(OCR2-2-phen)] (OCR2 = xanth, OCPh2 or OC(Ph)(2-Me-Ph)). In addition, homo- C-C couplings of the enones, chalcone (chalc) and dibenziylideneactetone (DBA), using magnesium(I) reducing agents, have afforded dimagnesium enolates, [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;-chalc2)] (Ar = Mes or Xyl) and [{(DipNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;-DBA2)]. A pinacol coupling reaction between [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] and 2-adamantanone (OAd) yielded [{(DipNacnac)(OAd)Mg}2(&#956;-OAd2)], presumably via a ketyl intermediate. This study further highlights the utility magnesium(I) compounds have as selective reducing agents in organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8208;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F = 68%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F = 2%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Using Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP), which inhibits the freezing of water, is highly O&#8208;glycosylated with a disaccharide,&#160;D&#8208;Gal&#946;1&#8208;3&#8208;D&#8208;GalNAc&#945; (GalGalNAc). To elucidate the function of the sugar residues for antifreeze activity at the molecular level, we conducted a total chemical synthesis of partially sugar deleted AFGP derivatives, and&#160;unnatural forms of&#160;AFGPs incorporating glucose (Glc)&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose (Gal)&#8208;type sugars. These elaborated AFGP derivatives demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each sugar residues on AFGPs precisely correlates with the antifreeze activity. A hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange experiment using synthetic AFGPs revealed a different dynamic behaviour of water around sugar residues depending on the sugar structures. These results indicate that sugar residues on AFGP form a unique dynamic water phase that disturbs the absorbance of water molecules onto the ice surface, thereby inhibiting freezing.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerized Nitrogen&#8208;Annulated Perylene Synthesized from 1,6&#8208;Diazecine as Chiral Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this&#160;work,&#160;nitrogen&#8208;annulated perylene (NP)&#160;was dimerized into one framework connected by two nitrogen atoms, generating the target molecule of&#160;DNP&#8208;DA. Owing to the substructure of 1,6&#8208;diazecine ten&#8208;membered ring,&#160;DNP&#8208;DAillustrates helical chirality with moderate dissymmetry factor, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation and supramolecular interactions with acceptors etc.&#160;Notably,&#160;DNP&#8208;DA&#160;represents a limited example of nitrogen&#8208;perylene&#160;based CPL emitter with glum&#160;around 6 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Intrigued by the facile fabrication via a simple amination&#8208;cross coupling sequence and other above advancing features, this work demonstrates the potential generality of utilizing 1,6&#8208;diazecine as a chiral unit to build CPL&#8208;active&#160;materials.</dc:description>
