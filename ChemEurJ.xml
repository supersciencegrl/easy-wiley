         <title>Hydrogenation of Terminal Alkenes Catalyzed by Air&#8208;Stable Mn(I) Complexes Bearing an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based PCP Pincer Ligand</title>

Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described.







Abstract
Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non&#8208;precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields. The hydrogenation proceeds at 100&#8201;&#176;C with catalyst loadings of 0.25&#8211;0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 2.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% base (KOtBu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20&#8197;bar. Mechanistic insight into the catalytic reaction is provided by means of DFT calculations.

         <title>Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flipping disc networks: A discotic star shaped mesogen decorated with three DNA bases thymine reversibly switches between a columnar and an extraordinary bicontinuous cubic network. The double nanosegregated bicontinuous structure is stabilized by self&#8208;association of hydrogen bonding thymines and realize a 3D charge transport. A phase flipping is also discerned by the addition of adenine as complementary base.







Abstract
A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic 
 phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds. This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;driven Distinct Nanomechanical, Optical, Photophysical, and Conducting Properties in a Benzothiophene&#8208;quinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphic forms of organic conjugated small molecules, with their unique molecular shapes, packing arrangements, and interaction patterns, provide an excellent opportunity to uncover how their microstructures influence their observable properties. Ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate (BZQ) exists as dimorphs with distinct crystal habits&#8213;blocks (BZB) and needles (BZN). The crystal forms differ in their molecular arrangements&#8213;BZB has a slip&#8208;stacked column&#8208;like structure in contrast to a zig&#8208;zag crystal packing with limited &#960;&#8211;overlap in BZN. The BZB crystals characterized by extended &#960;&#8208;stacking along [100] demonstrated semiconductor behavior, whereas the BZN, with its zig&#8208;zag crystal packing and limited stacking characteristics, was reckoned as an insulator. The crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties. Excitation of these crystals using a 532 nm laser confirmed the propagation of elastically scattered photons (green) and the subsequent generation of inelastically scattered (orange) photons by the crystals. Further, the dimorphs display dissimilar photoluminescence properties; they are both blue&#8208;emissive, but BZN displays twice the quantum yield of BZB.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.</dc:description>

         <title>Bisurea&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Tunable Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea&#8208;based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8208;5 monomers in the cross&#8208;section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co&#8208;assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water&#8208;compatibility and no toxicity for different cell&#8208;lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea&#8208;based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2&#160;Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2&#160;to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R = isopropyl &gt; adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Metal in the Biointeraction of Metallacarboranes with C. elegans Embryos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have transitioned from performing chemical scale studies involving the interaction of metallabis(dicarbollides) with biomolecules in a round&#8208;bottom flask, to now conducting in&#8197;vivo experiments using C. elegans. Results suggest metal (Fe or Co) plays a crucial role in C. elegans at the L4 stage and in embryos, and shows a stronger interaction with ferra compared to cobaltabis(dicarbollides).







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ferrabis(dicarbollide), and their halogenated derivatives are the most studied metallacarboranes with great medical potential. These versatile compounds and their iodinated derivatives can be used in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, particle therapy, and bioimaging when isotopes are used. These metallacarboranes have been evaluated in&#8197;vitro and recently in&#8197;vivo with complex animal models. Lately, these studies have been complemented using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nematode largely used in toxicology. When evaluated at the L4 stage, cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;), exhibited a higher mean lethal dose (LD50) than ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722;). In this work, we used the C. elegans embryos since they are a complex biological barrier with concentric layers of polysaccharides and proteins that protect them from the environment. We assessed if the metal atom changes their biointeraction with the C. elegans embryos. First, we assessed the effects on embryo development for metallacarboranes and their di&#8208;iodinated derivatives. We observed changes in color and in their surface structure. An exhaustive physicochemical characterization was performed to understand better this interaction, revealing a stronger interaction of ferrabis(dicarbollide) compounds with C. elegans embryos than the cobaltabis(dicarbollide) molecules. Unveiling the biological interaction of these compounds is of great interest for their future biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;Derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on Non&#8208;Polar ZnO&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAK(128&#8211;144)&#8208;peptide adsorption revealed high affinity towards etched single&#8208;crystalline ZnO(11
0) surfaces with adhesion forces ranging up to 600&#8197;pN, measured by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy (SMFS). With the application of the Bell&#8208;Evans theory and complementary peptide adsorption studies, we decipher possible adhesion mechanisms to originate from coordination&#8208; and hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO
 surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600&#8197;pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.

         <title>Quo Vadis CO2 Activation: Catalytic Reduction of CO2 to Methanol Using Aluminum and Gallium/Carbon&#8208;based Ambiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric vs. Catalytic: The herein reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles, a new class of hidden frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring an aluminum or gallium fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold, react stoichiometrically with CO2 forming the stable adducts but also act as an efficient catalyst for the reduction of CO2 mediated by HBpin.







Abstract
We report on so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden FLPs&#8221; (FLP: frustrated Lewis pair) consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring a group 13 fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold to form five&#8208;membered ring structures. Although the formation of the Lewis acid/base adducts was observed in the solid state, most of the title compounds readily react with carbon dioxide to provide stable insertion products. Strikingly, 0.3&#8211;3.0&#8197;mol% of the reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methanol with satisfactory high selectivity and yields using pinacol borane as stoichiometric reduction equivalent. Comprehensive computational studies provided valuable mechanistic insights and shed more light on activity differences.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial metalloenzymes based on a cobalt cofactor show higher activity than the free cobalt complex for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous medium. The cobalt cofactor is presumably stabilized by the hydrophobic cleft provided by the protein NB4.

Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. This work reports the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8722; (X=Cl, Br; Me3TACD=N,N',N''&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal=CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97&#8201;% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.

         <title>Preparation of Carbazoles Involving 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization, Photoredox&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Thermal Cyclization Reactions: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for the preparation of the carbazole moiety are reviewed. These methods describe the formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Photochemical, thermal and electrochemical transformations are described as interesting preparative methodologies.







Abstract
Carbazole is a heterocyclic motif that can be found in a diverse array of natural and unnatural products displaying a wide range of biological and physiological properties. Furthermore, this heterocycle is part of electronic materials like photoconducting polymers and organic optoelectronic materials owing to its excellent photophysical characteristics. Consequently, the development of synthetic strategies for carbazole scaffolds holds potential significance in biological and material fields. In this regard, a variety of preparation methods has been developed to exploit their efficient and distinct formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions and enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Therefore, this review focuses on the synthesis of a set of carbazole derivatives describing a variety of methodologies that involve direct irradiation, photosensitization, photoredox, electrochemical and thermal cyclization reactions.

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS = trimethylsilyl, R = p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green and environmental protection has been of particular concern in modern chemistry research. In this work, we report a visible&#8208;light photocatalytic molecular reactor based on a novel zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) for the aerobic oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide in water. The Zr&#8208;MOF is constructed from perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand and [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters, and features a 3D (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topological structure with triangular channels of ~5 &#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26 &#197; along c&#8208;axis. Interestingly, this Zr&#8208;MOF exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor in water. When it is used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light in water, the Zr&#8208;MOF could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield, selectivity and superior recyclability. Furthermore, the mechanism studies revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#183;&#8208;) are the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique dynamic configuration&#160;of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99:1.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of a Common&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketiminate NacNac Framework via Sequential Lithiation and Small Molecule Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Enthalpy Compensation in Solvent Geometry Regulated Supramolecular Polymerization of Luminescent Napthalimide via a Non&#8208;Cooperative, Isodesmic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are an important class of materials with fascinating functions and properties originated from the dynamic behavior and highly ordered molecular organizations. Here, a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor based functionalized luminescent napthalene monoimide (NMI) undergoes J&#8208;type self&#8208;assembly by non&#8208;covalent interactions via a non&#8208;cooperative, isodesmic mechanism to form supramolecular 1D nanowire. The fundamental insights into the thermodynamics regulating the supramolecular polymerization were derived through the fitting of the isodesmic model to variable temperature UV/Vis data in linear (dodecane) and nonlinear hydrocarbon (decalin) based solvents. This shows a significant role of entropy&#8208;enthalpy compensation in solvent geometry&#8208;regulated formation and stabilization of supramolecular polymer. Furthermore, we have quantitively estimated the influence of solvent geometry and found that NMI forms stronger self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous gel in linear hydrocarbon based solvent compared to nonlinear one and thereby substantially increases the degree of polymerization in linear hydrocarbon solvent (dodecane). This is accredited to the effective influence of the linear hydrocarbon solvent molecules in the polymerization process by favourable van der Waals&#160;interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains of the NMI monomers in contrast to unfavourable interaction of nonlinear hydrocarbon solvent due to geometry mismatch.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals Formation Process: The Conversion from Heptazine to Triazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (triazine imide)&#160;(PTI)&#160;generally&#160;obtained via ionothermal synthesis features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhanced crystallinity. However, in&#8208;depth investigation of the polycondensation&#160;process for PTI is an onerous task due to multiple influencing factors and limited characterization techniques. Herein, to&#160;simplify the polymerization route and exclude non&#8208;essential factors, PTI was prepared by calcining only melamine and LiCl. This&#160;study aims to identify the pivotal role of LiCl in PTI formation, which can convert heptazine&#8208;based intermediates into more stable triazine&#8208;based PTI framework. Based on this discovery, we&#160;demonstrate&#160;the transformation process of the prepared samples from amorphous Bulk g&#8208;C3N4&#160;to regular PTI, and further prove that the reaction with LiCl causes disruption of heptazine covalent organic frameworks.&#160;Additionally,&#160;the PTI exhibits higher&#160;photocatalytic water splitting performance due to efficient charge carrier mobility and separation,&#160;as well as&#160;faster reaction kinetics. This discovery deepens understanding&#160;of the polycondensation&#160;process of PTI crystals and provides insights toward the rational design of crystalline carbon nitride&#8208;based semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable Off&#8211;On Tunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by the Regulation of Pyrene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is always a challenge to achieve &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent switch by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions. Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non&#8208;emissive crystal consists of ordered H&#8208;aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti&#8208;parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material. The present results promote an in&#8208;depth insight between packing structure and photophysical property, and offer an effective strategy for the construction of luminescence &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching materials, toward the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries demonstrate enormous energy density are promising forms of energy storage. Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6&#160;catholyte for lithium sulfur battery. The conductive CNTs facilitates fast electronic/ionic transport, while the polarity of NSN as a strong affinity to lithium polysulfides, effectively anchoring them, facilitating the redox conversion of polysulfide species, and effectively diminishing reaction barriers. The cell with NSN@CNTs delivers the first discharge capacity of 1123.8 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;and maintains 786.5 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;after 300 cycles (0.2 C) at the sulfur loading 5.4 mg. Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;even at a high discharge rate of 2 C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33 mAh even at 10.8 mg for duration of 100 cycles.

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials Containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.







Abstract
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8211;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing compounds that store and release solar energy is crucial for overcoming its intermittent nature. In Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, a high&#8208;energy photoisomer captures and releases energy. While photoisomerization is well&#8208;studied, back&#8208;conversion using catalysts is underexplored. We compare 27 catalysts in a Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane MOST system, offering insights for effective catalyst development and testing, highlighting the efficiency of Pt based heterogenous catalyst.







Abstract
Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high&#8208;energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)&#8208;systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back&#8208;conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.

These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high-energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;MO&lt;/span&gt;lecular &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;olar &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;hermal (MOST)-systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back-conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Crystallographic Structure and Metal Vacancies on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of Ni&#8208;based Layered Hydroxides
</title>

The &#945;&#8208;layered hydroxide (LH) phase with Ni vacancies is the most electroactive catalyst among LH structures containing exclusively Ni(II).







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based layered hydroxides (LHs) are a family of efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, fundamental aspects such as the influence of the crystalline structure and the role of lattice distortion of the catalytic sites remain poorly understood and typically muddled. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive investigation on &#593;&#8208;LH, &#946;&#8208;LH and layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases by means of structural, spectroscopical, in&#8208;silico and electrochemical studies, which suggest the key aspect exerted by Ni&#8208;vacancies in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirm that the presence of Ni&#8208;vacancies produces acute distortions of the electroactive Ni sites (reflected as the shortening of the Ni&#8722;O distances and changes in the O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O angles), triggering the appearance of Ni localised electronic states on the Fermi level, reducing the Egap, and consequently, increasing the reactivity of the electroactive sites in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem Raman and XAS measurements unveil its transformation into a highly reactive oxyhydroxide&#8208;like phase that remains stable under ambient conditions. Hence, this work pinpoints the critical role of the crystalline structure as well as the electronic properties of LH structures on their inherent electrochemical reactivity towards OER catalysis. We envision Ni&#8208;based &#593;&#8208;LH as a perfect platform for hosting trivalent cations, closing the gap toward the next generation of benchmark efficient earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts.

         <title>Collective Effects of Multiple Fluorine Atoms Causing &#960;&#8208;philic Characteristic within a Caged Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyanionic Mo132O372 architecture with perfluorinated interior surface favors capturing small non&#8208;aromatic guests carrying &#960;&#8208;bonds in water, which contrasts to the behavior of the non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts. Through systematic and control studies, it is revealed that collective effects of multiple C&#8722;F bonds, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible for the facile guest encapsulation.







Abstract
Perfluorination brings about distinctive properties arising from the unusual nature of the F element, which have been extensively developed in materials science and chemistry. Herein we report that the construction of F&#8208;rich inner space within a hollowed Mo132O372 cage ([Mo132O372(OCOR)30(H2O)72]42&#8722;) leads to the emergence of unique guest binding activities in encapsulation. Prominently, the trifluoroacetate&#8208;modified cage (R=CF3, 2) having as many as 90 F groups inside favors trapping cyclopentadiene (Cp), which is hardly trapped by the non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart (R=CH3, 1). Systematic studies using related hydrocarbons show that the amount of the encapsulated guest is correlated with the unsaturation degree of the guests, implying the involvement of the attractive interaction of the CF3&#8208;modified interior wall with the guest &#960;&#8208;electron clouds. Control experiments using the semi&#8208;fluorinated analogues (R=CF2H, CFH2) reveal that the perfluorination is a critical factor to facilitate the Cp encapsulation by 2, indicating that collective effects of polar C&#8722;F bonds spreading over the interior surface, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible. We also provide a successful example of the physical molecular confinement within the cage through the &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between trapped diene and dienophile.

         <title>Elucidating the Electronic Nature of Rh&#8208;based Paddlewheel Catalysts from 103Rh NMR Chemical Shifts: Insights from Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For heteroleptic dirhodium paddlewheel complexes, the NMR shifts of the two chemically different Rh are more than 1000&#8197;ppm apart. In line with symmetry considerations, the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic cis&#8208;effect onto the neighboring equatorial sites.







Abstract
The tremendous importance of dirhodium paddlewheel complexes for asymmetric catalysis is largely the result of an empirical optimization of the chiral ligand sphere about the bimetallic core. It was only recently that a H(C)Rh triple resonance 103Rh NMR experiment provided the long&#8208;awaited opportunity to examine &#8211; with previously inconceivable accuracy &#8211; how variation of the ligands impacts on the electronic structure of such catalysts. The recorded effects are dramatic: formal replacement of only one out of eight O&#8208;atoms surrounding the metal centers in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N&#8208;atom results in a shielding of the corresponding Rh&#8208;site of no less than 1000&#8197;ppm. The current paper provides the theoretical framework that allows this and related experimental observations made with a set of 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted. In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic 
&#8208;effect that they exert onto the neighboring equatorial sites. On top of these fundamental interactions, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic 
&#8208;effect of ligands of different donor strengths is reflected in the recorded 103Rh NMR shifts.

         <title>Stabilization of sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen Cation by Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Complex Formation with Intramolecular Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchimeric interaction with an sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation with iodine affords an isolable acid&#8208;base complex. The N&#8722;I bonding is non&#8208;covalent but rather strong, while the O&#8722;I bond of the ligand is ionic and weak, facilitating ligand exchange in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid. The generated I+ cation species can be employed for &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones.







Abstract
Here we show that the sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation is strongly stabilized by a peri&#8208;iodine substituent in the tetralone system. The cation is captured by anionic species such as CF3CO2&#8722;, affording hypervalent iodine(III) compounds with a short nitrogen&#8208;iodine (N&#8722;I) bond, in which the cation serves as a Lewis acid. Notably, the O&#8722;I bond of the O&#8208;trifluoroacetate or O&#8208;acetate is intrinsically weaker than the N&#8722;I bond due to its more ionic character and is further weakened by protonation in trifluoroacetic acid. As a result, the oxygen ligand can dissociate in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid, affording a I+ cation intermediate that retains the N&#8722;I bond. We isolated the cation as the tetrafluoroborate, and characterized it experimentally by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretically by means of DFT calculation. The results suggest that the N&#8722;I bonded cation is intrinsically stable, and is weakly coordinated with water and the BF4 counter anion or trifluoroacetate anion. This cation can be employed as a reagent for &#945;&#8208;oxidation of ketones.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compound collection inspired by both biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural product design concepts was rapidly accessed by divergent synthesis. Biological evaluation revealed compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles.







Abstract
Design strategies that can access natural&#8208;product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole alkaloid&#8208;inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84&#8197;compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that suppress in&#8197;vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.

         <title>Fluorescent Phenotyping of Blood Cells Using a Differential Sensing Strategy: Differentiating Physiological Aging Stages and Neuro&#8208;Degenerative Disease Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A differential sensing approach is demonstrated to distinguish distinct aging status of mouse using TCF probes. Despite there is no reliable CD markers selective for aging progress, cross&#8208;reactivity of TCF probes generates unique fingerprint of aging by blood cell analysis.







Abstract
Blood continually contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis of the body and contains information regarding the health state of an individual. However, current hematological analyses predominantly rely on a limited number of CD markers and morphological analysis. In this work, differentially sensitive fluorescent compounds based on TCF scaffolds are introduced that are designed for fluorescent phenotyping of blood. Depending on their structures, TCF compounds displayed varied responses to reactive oxygen species, biothiols, redox&#8208;related biomolecules, and hemoglobin, which are the primary influential factors within blood. Contrary to conventional CD marker&#8208;based analysis, this unbiased fluorescent phenotyping method produces diverse fingerprints of the health state. Precise discrimination of blood samples from 37&#8197;mice was demonstrated based on their developmental stages, ranging from 10 to 19&#8197;weeks of age. Additionally, this fluorescent phenotyping method enabled the differentiation between drugs with distinct targets, serving as a simple yet potent tool for pharmacological analysis to understand the mode of action of various drugs.

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized by cross&#8208;coupling two bowl&#8208;shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity. The catcher carefully framing the C70 fullerene is visualized as a miraculous, marvelous Faberg&#233; artwork. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;S. Oshchepkov, K.&#8197;Y. Amsharov, M.&#8197;E. P&#233;rez&#8208;Ojeda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302778).

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.</dc:description>

However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP-COF), featuring a multi-scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP-COF materials, including topological structure design, in-situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self-transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP-COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP-COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles to Azo&#8208;Linked&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source via its C3&#8208;reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor&#8208;mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2H&#8208;indazoles. The azo&#8208;linked&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both inzadole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;centred indazolone radical intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Unusual Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Type Bisindole Alkaloids from Alstonia macrophylla by Building Blocks&#8208;Based Molecular Networking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8722;C, together with their postulated biogenetic precursors, were isolated from the stem barks and leaves of&#160;Alstonia macrophylla via the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Alsmaphyline A represents&#160;a rare ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloid with an S&#8208;shape polycyclic ring system. Alsmaphylines B and C are two novel ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids with N&#8208;1&#8722;C&#8208;21'&#160;linkages, and the former possesses an unconventional stacked conformation due to the presence of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The chemical structures including absolute configurations of alsmaphylines A&#8722;C were established by&#160;comprehensive spectroscopic analyses,&#160;electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, a plausible biosynthetic pathway&#160;of these bisindole alkaloids as well as their ability to promote the protein synthesis on HT22 cells were discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Non&#8208;Solvated Dialkylalumanyl Anion and XPS Characterization of Al(I) and Al(II) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A non&#8208;solvated alkyl&#8208;substituted Al(I) anion dimer was synthesized by a reduction of haloalumane precursor using a mechanochemical method. The crystallographic and theoretical analysis revealed its structure and electronic properties. Experimental XPS analysis of the Al(I) anions with reference compounds revealed the lower Al 2p binding energy corresponds to the lower oxidation state of Al species. It should be emphasized that the experimentally obtained XPS binding energies were reproduced by delta SCF calculations and were linearly correlated with NPA charges and 2p orbital energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Control of Supramolecular Aggregation of Near Infrared Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Fluorophores Confined in Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of the intermolecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules as chromophores is crucial for tuning their physical properties such as light absorption/emission, and energy and charge transfer. Lots of advances have been achieved in control of intermolecular aggregation of organic chromophores in solid states where an indefinitely large number of molecules are involved. However, much less understanding has been gained at a mesoscale of aggregates formed by well&#8208;defined organization of a deterministic number of chromophores, which has been realized in natural photosynthetic systems but still remains rare in manmade materials. Here, we report both the kinetic and the thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a near&#8208;infrared cyanine dye, PPcy, and its derivatives confined in colloidal nanoparticles stabilized by surfactants in aqueous media. Our results demonstrate that both the aggregation number, the aggregation state and the optical properties of the PPcy chromophores are controllable through optimization of the alkyl and polymer chains tethered from PPcy, the effective concentration of the chromophore inside each particle, and the surfactants utilized to stabilize the colloids in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Using Palladium Catalysts Supported on Phosphine Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilicas (R&#8208;P&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph, tBu), which possess electron&#8208;donating alkyl substituents on the phosphorus atom, were synthesized using bifunctional compounds with alkoxysilyl&#8208; and phosphino groups, bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]phenylphosphine borane (1a) and bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine borane (1b). Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R&#8208;P&#8208;Pd&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph (2a), tBu (3a), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized 2a and 3a were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that 3a bearing more electron&#8208;donating tBu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of 3a was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells over 19%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate HOMO, and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.</dc:description>

Here we tested an NMR approach which relies on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from analogous cationic, anionic or neutral soluble nitroxide molecules, which distribute around the protein&#8208;ligand complex depending on near&#8208;surface electrostatic potentials. We applied this approach to two protein&#8208;ligand systems, interleukin&#8208;8 interacting with highly charged glycosaminoglycans and the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacting with less charged phospho&#8208;tyrosine tripeptides. The electrostatic potential around interleukin&#8208;8 and its changes upon binding of glycosaminoglycans could be derived from the PRE data and confirmed by theoretical predictions from Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann calculations. The ligand influence on the PREs and NMR&#8208;derived electrostatic potentials of Grb2 SH2 was localized to a narrow protein region which allowed the localization of the peptide binding pocket. Our analysis suggests that experiments with nitroxide cosolutes can be useful for investigating protein&#8208;ligand electrostatic interactions and mapping ligand binding sites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine(III) species are powerful reagents for oxidative C&#8208;N coupling reactions, providing access to valuable N&#8208;heterocycles. A new electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 1H&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by dehydrogenative C&#8208;N bond formation is presented. Catalytic amounts of the redox mediator, a low supporting electrolyte concentration and recycling of the solvent used make this method a sustainable alternative to electrochemical ex&#8208;cell or conventional approaches. Furthermore, inexpensive, readily available electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up are applied. The broad functional group tolerance could be demonstrated by synthesizing 23 examples in yields up to 96%, with one reaction being performed on a 10&#8208;fold higher scale. Based on the obtained results a sound reaction mechanism could be proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of O&#8209;Benzoylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of trifluoromethyl containing compounds is well established within medicinal chemistry, with a range of approved drugs containing C&#8208;CF3 and O&#8208;CF3 moieties. However, the utilisation of the N&#8209;CF3 functional group remains relatively unexplored. This may be attributed to the challenging synthesis of this unit, with many current methods employing harsh conditions or less accessible reagents. A robust methodology for the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of secondary amines has been developed, which employs an umpolung strategy in the form of a copper&#8209;catalysed electrophilic amination. The method is operationally simple, uses mild, inexpensive reagents, and has been used to synthesise a range of novel, structurally complex N&#8208;CF3 containing compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8208;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8208;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules are considered as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Multifunctional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report a multifunctional COF which consists of triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipy) entities. The obtained TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF is a heterogeneous photocatalyst and can efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. In addition, TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF can be further metalated by Pd(II) via 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipy&#8208;metal coordination. The generated Pd@TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF can highly promote photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;cyanopyridines via cascade addition/cyclization of arylboronic acids with &#947;&#8208;ketodinitriles in heterogeneous way. This work has demonstrated the way for the rational design and preparation of more efficient photoactive COFs for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use MOFs material as precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials loaded with In&#8208;S&#8208;O nanoparticles. The In&#8208;S&#8208;O nanoparticles have exhibited Janus architecture composed of two compounds with different crystal structures that are combined in&#8208;plane on two&#8208;dimensional carbon material surface. The excellent properties of this in&#8208;plane Janus material include 2D nanoarchitecture and its Janus properties formed by combining two different crystal structures. It has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances due to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area. According to experiments, the electron transfer number of the material for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction is about 2.4, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is 32 mg /h cm2. In the further &#160;test of liquid flow electrolytic cell, the yield can reach up to 172 mg /h cm2</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Based Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Supramolecular Metallohydrogel Organized by Using a Native Ultrashort Peptide Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing supramolecular hydrogels using short peptides is challenging. To control self&#8208;assembly, a certain amount of organic solvent is typically added to the system, or the short peptide is modified with a functional group that is hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or highly coordinative. We discovered that l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu2+ ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random&#8208;coil&#8208;like to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>New Multifunctional Bipyrimidine&#8208;Based Chromophores for NLO&#8208;Active Thin&#8208;Film Preparation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the preparation of bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains on the 4 position is described. Symmetry breaking by judicious functionalization of 3D organic octupoles allows the emergence of multifunctional liquid crystalline or crystalline chromophores, which can easily be processed into large, flexible, thin and self&#8208;oriented films presenting second harmonic generation response.







Abstract
New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges, which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.

A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide has been synthesized by copper&#8208;catalyzed method using diaryl ditelluride. Further, monotellurides were converted into corresponding tellurium cations. Next, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as catalysts to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines from anilines and highly regioselective creation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols from epoxides.







Abstract
A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl) benzamide ligand has been synthesized in a practical manner by the copper&#8208;catalyzed method by using diaryl ditelluride and Mg as a reductant at room temperature. In order to augment the Lewis acidity of these newly formed unsymmetrical monotellurides, these have been transformed into corresponding unsymmetrical 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurium cations. Subsequently, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as chalcogen bonding catalysts, enabling the synthesis of various substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines by activating ketones with anilines under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthesized 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide phenyl tellurium cation has also catalyzed the formation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in high regioselectivity by effectively activating epoxides at room temperature. Mechanistic insight by 1H and 19F NMR study, electrostatic surface potential (ESP map), control reaction in which tellurium cation reacted explosively with epoxide, suggested that the enhanced Lewis acidity of tellurium center seems responsible for efficient catalytic activities under mild conditions enabling &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent regioselectivity and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines with trifluoromethyl, nitro, and pyridylsubstitution, which were difficult to access.

         <title>Cyano Decoration of &#960;&#8208;Bridge to Boost Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence Quantum Yields of Triazine/Carbazole Based Blue TADF Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating less bulky cyano group to replace methyl on &#960; bridge of donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecule instead strengthened the thermally activated delayed fluorescence feature through enhancing intramolecular charge transfer, and boosted photoluminescence quantum yield from 40&#8201;% to 94&#8201;% by increasing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap, finally led to an EQE of 14&#8201;% in blue OLED.







Abstract
In general, a large donor&#8208;acceptor dihedral angle is required to guarantee sufficient frontier molecular orbitals separation for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which is intrinsically unfavorable for the radiative transition. We present a molecular design method favoring both reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative transitions even at a moderate D&#8722;A angle. A blue TADF emitter TrzBuCz&#8208;CN was designed with triazine/tert&#8208;butylcarbazole as donor/acceptor and cyano (CN) incorporated on the phenylene bridge. In comparison with the methyl decoration in similar way (TrzBuCz&#8722;Me), CN decoration reduced the D&#8722;A dihedral angle from 70&#176; to 60&#176;, which is intrinsically not favorable for sufficient FMO separation, but unexpectedly reduced the singlet and triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and thus facilitated TADF feature by pulling down the lowest singlet state energy. While the reduced distorsion instead improved the HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap and boosted the fluorescence quantum yield from 41&#8201;% to 94&#8201;%. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode of TrzBuCz&#8208;CN exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with emission peak at 466&#8197;nm, greatly superior to 6.0&#8201;% of TrzBuCz&#8722;Me. The result provides a feasible design strategy to facilitate both RISC and radiation processes by CN decoration of the linking bridge of TADF emitters.

         <title>Deciphering Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Amination with Organic Azides: N2 Cleavage from a Stable Organoazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidating the mechanism of C&#8722;H amination with organic azides: a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex that is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state undergoes gradual N2 loss, demonstrated by NMR kinetics, M&#246;ssbauer measurements, photo&#8208;crystallography, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8722;H bonds offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8722;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8722;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex from [Fe(N(SiMe3)2)2] and AdN3 (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (Keq=62). Photo&#8208;crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N2, which imparted an Fe&#8722;N bond shortening and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N2, and subsequent formation of a C&#8722;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8722;H bond of the N(SiMe3)2 ligand. Monitoring this reaction by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.

&lt;p&gt;Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8722;H bonds offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8722;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8722;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-N coordinated organoazide complex from [Fe(N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and AdN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ad=1-adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and zero-field &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;=62). Photo-crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which imparted an Fe&#8722;N bond shortening and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and subsequent formation of a C&#8722;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8722;H bond of the N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ligand. Monitoring this reaction by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Photothermal Materials Obtained Using Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There's a twist! Organic photothermal materials based on the anilino&#8208;naphthalenediimide (ANDI) acceptor are rationally designed using sterically hindered donors with a large dihedral angle to reduce radiative processes. The ANDI materials demonstrate near&#8208;infrared absorbance and high photothermal conversion efficiencies upon encapsulation into nanoparticles.







Abstract
Organic small molecules with high photothermal conversion efficiencies that absorb near&#8208;infrared light are desirable for photothermal therapy due to their improved biocompatibility compared to inorganic materials and their ability to absorb light in the biological transparency window (650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). Here we report three donor&#8208;acceptor organic materials DM&#8208;ANDI, O&#8208;ANDI, and S&#8208;ANDI that show high photothermal conversion efficiencies of 46&#8211;68&#8201;% with near&#8208;infrared absorption. The design of these molecules is based on the rational modification of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence material to favour a low photoluminescence quantum yield by reducing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap. Encapsulating these materials into either neat nanoparticles or aggregated organic dots modulates their photothermal conversion efficiencies, and also facilitates dispersion in water.

         <title>Easy to Use DFT Approach for Computational pKa Determination of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational chemistry has an intrinsically green approach, as it gives us the possibility to predict molecular properties, such as the pKa, thereby avoiding time&#8208;consuming experiments. It combines the past of experimental chemistry with the future. In the cartoon, our DFT&#8208;based &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8208;methodology&#8221; is shown. Note the accurate result in predicting the pKa values of trifluoro&#8208; and trichloroacetic acid, easily obtained by adding two water molecules at the reaction centre. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Sabuzi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303167).

         <title>Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission&#160;towards fully substituted polyethylene analogues with non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on the variety and quantity of substitutions. Generally, polyethylene can only be fully substituted with fluorine atoms mainly, e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene and nafion, because atomic radius of fluorine atom is small enough. The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radius than fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with intriguing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors. Through Barbier polymerization of diphenyldichloromethane and different peroxyesters in the presence of Mg in one pot, a series of FSPEAs, including polytriphenylethanol (PTPE), polydiphenylfurylethanol (PDPFE), polydiphenylthiophenylethanol (PDPTE) and polydiphenylnaphthylethanol (PDPNE) have been successfully prepared. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated. Therefore, this work opens up a new approach for the molecular design of FSPEA with non&#8208;conjugated luminescence, which may cause inspirations to different research fields like polyolefin and luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor Targeted Cuprous&#8208;Based Nanocomposite as Responsive Cascade Nanocatalyst for Efficient Tumor Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The single&#8208;functionality of traditional chemodynamic therapy (CDT) reagents usually limits the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment. Synergistic nanocomposites that involve cascade reaction provide a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory anticancer effects. Herein, a cuprous&#8208;based nanocomposite (CCS@GOx@HA) is fabricated, which owns the tumor targeting ability and can undergo tumor microenvironment responsive cascade reaction to enhance the tumor therapeutic efficiency significantly. Surface modification of nanocomposite with hyaluronic acid enables the targeted delivery of the nanocomposite to cancer cells. Acid&#8208;triggered decomposition of nanocomposite in cancer cell results in the release of Cu+, Se2&#8208; and GOx. The Cu+ improves the Fenton&#8208;like reaction with endogenous H2O2 to generate highly toxic &#8226;OH for CDT. While GOx can not only catalyze the in situ generation of endogenous H2O2, but also accelerate the consumption of intratumoral glucose to reduce nutrient supply in tumor site. In addition, Se2&#8208; further improves the therapeutic effects of CDT by upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells. Meanwhile, the surface modification endows the nanocomposite the good water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate satisfactory anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic performance by the synergistic cascade function of CCS@GOx@HA than CDT alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene Stabilized Silylone/Germylone leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA&#8208;NOCV Analyses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Researchers have successfully isolated Si0/Ge0 species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them. These elusive compounds have been stabilized in singlet ground states using different donor base ligands. Driess et al. have particularly made strides in this area, isolating carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized silylone/germylone and their N+/Pb analogues. Carborane (C2B10H10) plays a pivotal role as a redox&#8208;active ligand, converting from closo&#8208;carborane to nido&#8208;carborane with the addition of two electrons. Notably, anomalous oxidation of Si0/Ge0 centres in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized species to SiI/GeI has been reported, resulting in the formation of dimeric SiI&#8208;SiI/GeI&#8208;GeI dicationic units. This study of Energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) focuses on the carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene ligand in the free state, and its three other species, including silylone/germylone species. Interestingly, it reveals that the carborane unit in an anionic doublet state tends to form one electron&#8208;sharing bond and one dative bond with the counter fragment in its cationic doublet state. This helps us to rationalize why the carborane unit undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements leading to the formation of a dianionic carborane unit with a significantly elongated C&#8208;C bond (2.38&#8208;2.68 &#197;) and undergoing unusual oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of a chiral supramolecular organogel via the hierarchical helical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives is described herein. Owing to the photocatalysis of riboflavin and the supramolecular chirality induced in the helically stacked riboflavin/melamine complex, the gel is observed to act as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor of optically active alcohols by detecting the change in color from yellow to green. The gel also served as an efficient chiral adsorbent, enabling optical resolution of a racemic compound with high chiral recognition ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine by a Two&#8208;enzyme Cascade System with PLP Cofactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;enzyme cascade system containing &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;&#8208;TA) and L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;ThA) was reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine starting from benzylamine, and PLP was utilized as the only cofactor in these both two enzymes reaction system. Based on the transamination results, benzylamine was optimized as an advantageous amino donor as confirmed by MD simulation results. This cascade reaction system could not only facilitate the in situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also establish a novel pathway for synthesizing high&#8208;value phenyl&#8208;serine derivatives. In our study, nearly 95% of benzylamine was converted, yielding over 54% of 3&#8208;Phenylserine under the optimized conditions cascade reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Monoterpenes by an Engineered Cytochrome P450</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein engineering of cytochrome P450s has enabled these biocatalysts to promote a variety of abiotic reactions beyond nature's repertoire. Integrating such non&#8208;natural transformations with microbial biosynthetic pathways could allow sustainable enzymatic production of modified natural product derivatives. In particular, trifluoromethylation is a highly desirable modification in pharmaceutical research due to the positive effects of the trifluoromethyl group on drug potency, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. This study demonstrates the biosynthesis of non&#8208;natural trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives of natural monoterpene scaffolds using an engineered cytochrome P450 variant, P411&#8208;PFA. P411&#8208;PFA successfully catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoromethyl carbene from 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane to the terminal alkenes of several monoterpenes, including L&#8208;carveol, carvone, perilla alcohol, and perillartine, to generate the corresponding trifluoromethylated cyclopropane products. Furthermore, integration of this abiotic cyclopropanation reaction with a reconstructed metabolic pathway for L&#8208;carveol production in Escherichia coli enabled one&#8208;step biosynthesis of a trifluoromethylated L&#8208;carveol derivative from limonene precursor. Overall, amalgamating synthetic enzymatic chemistry with established metabolic pathways represents a promising approach to sustainably produce bioactive natural product analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;assisted Arylation of Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple A: Addition&#8208;Assisted Arylation methods which make use of Lewis base&#8208;generated enolates are described in this concept. Different fields of synthetic organic chemistry are covered, including transition metal catalysis, hypervalent main group element&#8208;centered rearrangements and organocatalyzed aryl&#8208;migration reactions. The conceptual similarities and differences are briefly discussed with the goal to apply this strategy in future method development.







Abstract
The combination of Lewis bases with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls allows the in&#8208;situ generation of enolates without the need for strong Br&#248;nsted bases. Recently developed synthetic methods employ this approach for arylation followed by elimination of the Lewis base, regenerating the alkene. This strategy has been deployed for formal &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation in different contexts, namely (a) transition metal catalysis, (b) rearrangement reactions utilizing hypervalent main group elements and (c) organocatalysis. This concept article provides an overview of the developed strategies, highlighting and contextualizing their features.

         <title>Spin Qubit in a 2D GdIIINaI&#8208;Based Oxamato Supramolecular Coordination Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diamagnetically diluted two&#8208;dimensional oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIII&#8208;based complex is shown to be a good candidate for molecular qubits, and its near isotropy of GdIII ion and the phonon bottleneck effect from resonance phonon trapped were calculated and fitted to be responsible for the field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation, relatively long spin&#8208;lattace and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times.







Abstract
Qubits are the basic unit of quantum information and computation. To realize quantum computing and information processing, the decoherence times of qubits must be long enough. Among the studies of molecule&#8208;based electron spin qubits, most of the work focused on the ions with the spin S=1/2, where only single&#8208;bit gates can be constructed. However, quantum operations require the qubits to interact with each other, so people gradually carry out relevant research in ions or systems with S&gt;1/2 and multilevel states. In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIIINaI&#8208;based oxamato supramolecular coordination framework, Na[Gd(4&#8208;HOpa)4(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (1, 4&#8208;HOpa=N&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenyloxamate), was selected as a possible carrier of qubit. The field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation shows this system has phonon bottleneck (PB) effect at low temperatures with a very weak magnetic anisotropy. The pulse electron paramagnetic resonance studies show the spin&#8208;lattice and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times are T1=1.66&#8197;ms at 4&#8197;K and Tm=4.25&#8197;&#956;s at 8&#8197;K for its diamagnetically diluted sample (1Gd0.12&#8201;%). It suggested that the relatively long decoherence time is mainly ascribed to its near isotropic and the PB effect from resonance phonon trapped for pure sample, while the dilution further improves its qubit performance.

A new type of herringbone helical foldamer based on a non&#8208;natural codon, i.&#8201;e., aromatic ether derived &#1013;&#8208;amino acid, was designed, synthesized and characterized.

Abstract
Oligomers based on an aromatic ether derived &#1013;&#8208;amino acid peptides folded into herringbone helical structures, induced by successive NH&#8722;O&#8722;NH &amp; O&#8722;NH&#8722;O bifurcated hydrogen bonding interactions and reinforced by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between aryls from adjacent layers. The diaryl ether bonds &#8722;O&#8722; worked both as structural units to provide turn motifs for changing the amplitude of the slope along the axis of helix for herringbone formation, and also as acceptors for hydrogen bonding. Attachment of a single chiral carbon to the C&#8208;termini of the peptides induced excess of single&#8208;handed screw sense and amplification through the chain propagation as exemplified by chain length dependent circular dichroism (CD) investigations.

         <title>Is Enol Always the Culprit? The Curious Case of High Enantioselectivity in a Chiral Rh(II) Complex Catalyzed Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>

Acquitting enol of all charges: The reaction mechanism and stereoselectivity of a Rh(II) catalyzed indole alkylation reaction with in&#8197;situ generated carbenes are investigated. The reaction proceeds via a novel metal&#8208;associated enol pathway and not via a previously reported metal&#8208;free/oxocarbenium route.







Abstract
The mechanism of Rh2(S&#8208;NTTL)4 catalyzed carbene insertion into C(3)&#8722;H of indole is investigated using DFT methods. Since the commonly accepted enol mechanism cannot account for enantioinduction, a concerted oxocarbenium pathway was proposed in an earlier work using a model catalyst. However, after considering the full catalytic system, this study finds that akin to other reactions, here, too, the enol pathway is of lower energy, which now naturally raises a conundrum regarding the mode of chiral induction. Herein, a new water promoted mechanistic pathway involving a metal&#8208;associated enol intermediate hydrogen bonding and stereochemical model are proposed to solve this puzzle. It is shown how the catalyst bowl&#8208;shaped structure along with substrate&#8208;catalyst binding is crucial for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity. A stereodetermining water&#8208;assisted proton transfer is proposed and confirmed through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. The water molecules are held together by H&#8208;bonding interactions with the carboxylate ligands that is reminiscent of enzyme catalysis. Although several previous studies have aimed at understanding the mechanism of metal catalyzed carbene insertion reactions, the origin of high stereoinduction especially with chiral metal complexes remains unclear, and till date there is no transition state model that can explain the high enantioselectivity with such chiral Rh complexes. The metal&#8208;associated enol pathway is currently underrepresented in catalytic cycles and may play a crucial role in catalyst design. Since the enol pathway is commonly adopted in other metal&#8208;catalyzed X&#8722;H insertion reactions involving a diazoester, the presented results are not specific to the current reaction. Therefore, this study could provide the direction for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity which is otherwise difficult to achieve with a single metal catalyst.

Nickel catalyst: Nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ligands are effective precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis and characterization of nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ancillary ligands, along with the successful application of these complexes as precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). These reactions proceeded with low nickel loadings of 2.5&#8208;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% in the absence of co&#8208;solvent, and in some cases at room temperature. Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples. This reactivity is unprecedented for nickel and offers a powerful means of achieving functionalization at a C&#8722;H position remote from the C=C double bond. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed deuteroboration experiments using DBPin support a mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;insertion of the alkene and subsequent chain&#8208;walking, which results in isotopic scrambling.

         <title>A Freestanding 3D Skeleton with Gradationally Distributed Lithiophilic Sites for Realizing Stable Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards stable Li metal anode: Lithiophilic ZnO with a gradient distribution was embedded onto a 3D carbon nanotube@carbon felt (CNT@CF) substrate, which served as a scaffold for constructing a stable Li metal anode, to prepare a ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode with an inverted structure via electrodeposition. Owing to the synergistic effect of Li metal and the lithiophilic LiZn alloy, the composite electrode with an inverted structure drove Li+ deposition toward the interior of the skeleton. Moreover, the composite electrode moderately prevented Li+ accumulation on the skeleton surface, thereby improving battery safety. Consequently, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode performed well in both symmetric and full&#8208;cell setups.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes are drawing considerable attention owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacities and low electrochemical reduction potentials. However, their commercialization has been hampered by safety hazards induced by continuous dendrite growth. These issues can be alleviated using the ZnO&#8208;modified 3D carbon&#8208;based host containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon felt (CF) fabricated by electroplating in the present study (denoted as ZnO/CNT@CF). The constructed skeleton has lithiophilic ZnO that is gradationally distributed along its thickness. The utilization of an inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode obtained by flipping over the carbon skeleton after Li electrodeposition is also reported herein. The synergistic effect of the Li metal and lithiophilic sites reduces the nucleation overpotential, thus inducing Li+ to preferentially deposit inside the porous carbon&#8208;based scaffold. The composite electrode compels Li to grow away from the separator, thereby significantly improving battery safety. A symmetric cell with the inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode operates steadily for 700&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Towards stable Li metal anode&lt;/b&gt;: Lithiophilic ZnO with a gradient distribution was embedded onto a 3D carbon nanotube@carbon felt (CNT@CF) substrate, which served as a scaffold for constructing a stable Li metal anode, to prepare a ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode with an inverted structure via electrodeposition. Owing to the synergistic effect of Li metal and the lithiophilic LiZn alloy, the composite electrode with an inverted structure drove Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition toward the interior of the skeleton. Moreover, the composite electrode moderately prevented Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation on the skeleton surface, thereby improving battery safety. Consequently, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode performed well in both symmetric and full-cell setups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal anodes are drawing considerable attention owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacities and low electrochemical reduction potentials. However, their commercialization has been hampered by safety hazards induced by continuous dendrite growth. These issues can be alleviated using the ZnO-modified 3D carbon-based host containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon felt (CF) fabricated by electroplating in the present study (denoted as ZnO/CNT@CF). The constructed skeleton has lithiophilic ZnO that is gradationally distributed along its thickness. The utilization of an inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode obtained by flipping over the carbon skeleton after Li electrodeposition is also reported herein. The synergistic effect of the Li metal and lithiophilic sites reduces the nucleation overpotential, thus inducing Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to preferentially deposit inside the porous carbon-based scaffold. The composite electrode compels Li to grow away from the separator, thereby significantly improving battery safety. A symmetric cell with the inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode operates steadily for 700&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li|S cell exhibits an initial areal capacity of 10.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a S loading of 10.4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains a capacity of 3.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after 320&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Artificial Liposome Compartment with Size Exclusion Molecular Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial compartments with uniform diameters were constructed by using DNA origami as the internal skeleton of a liposome. The interior of the liposome was completely isolated from the external environment. Furthermore, the incorporation of an active membrane protein into the compartment enabled the selective transport of small molecules below 600&#8197;Da.







Abstract
The cellular compartment plays an essential role in organizing the complex and diverse biochemical reactions within the cell. By mimicking the function of such cellular compartments, the challenge of constructing artificial compartments has been taken up to develop new biochemical tools for efficient material production and diagnostics. The important features required for the artificial compartment are that it isolates the interior from the external environment and is further functionalized to control the transport of target chemicals to regulate the interior concentration of both substrate and reaction products. In this study, an artificial compartment with size&#8208;selective molecular transport function was constructed by using a DNA origami&#8208;guided liposome prepared by modifying the method reported by Perrault et&#8197;al. This completely isolates the liposome interior, including the DNA origami skeleton, from the external environment and allows the assembly of a defined number of molecules of interest inside and/or outside the compartment. By incorporating a bacterial membrane protein, OmpF, into the liposome, the resulting artificial compartment was shown to transport only the molecule of interest with a molecular weight below 600&#8197;Da from the external environment into the interior of the compartment.

         <title>Single Crystals of Insoluble Porous Salicylimine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of three barely soluble triptycene based porous organic cages have been obtained and their crystal packing as well as gas sorption properties elucidated. The relation between crystallinity, porosity and gas adsorption selectivity was revealed for these porous structures.







Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) are meanwhile an established class of porous materials. Most of them are soluble to a certain extend and thus processable in or from solution. However, a few of larger salicylimine cages were reported to be insoluble in any organic solvents and thus characterized as amorphous materials. These cages were now synthesized as single&#8208;crystalline materials to get insight into packing motifs and preferred intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the pairs of crystalline and amorphous materials for each cage allowed to compare their gas&#8208;sorption properties in both morphological states.

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Activated and RGD&#8208;Conjugated Ultrasmall Fe/PPy Nanopolymers for Enhanced Tumor Photothermal Ferrotherapy and MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach has been developed for preparation of the RGD&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall Fe/PPy nanopolymers for enhanced tumor photothermal ferrotherapy and MR imaging. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also enhanced the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. This synergetic photothermal ferrotherapeutic effect greatly improved the efficiency of tumor treatment.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown great promise for tumor ferrotherapy in recent years. However, nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis has low therapeutic efficacy owing to unsatisfactory Fenton reaction activity in a typical tumor microenvironment. In this study, NIR light&#8208;activated Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD nanopolymers were developed to combine photothermal therapy and ferrotherapy and achieve enhanced antitumor activity. Importantly, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD exhibited excellent therapeutic performance under NIR light activation both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also enhanced the release of iron ions and the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, by virtue of RGD conjugation and its ultrasmall size, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD could effectively accumulate at tumor sites in living mice after systemic administration and could be monitored via MR imaging. Hence, this study provides a promising approach for integrating ferrotherapy with photothermal therapy to achieve enhanced tumor treatment.

Bifunctional OER catalyst: N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) was proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst showed excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, more advantageous &#916;E value (Ej=10&#8722;E1/2) and good long&#8208;term stability based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon.







Abstract
The design of non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding performance and remarkable stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most essential issues to the realization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) is proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without extra phosphine and nitrogen sources. The facile and rapid plasma treatment can achieve phosphorus vacancies which could modulate the electronic structure to enhance the inherent active and electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the pyridine&#8208;N and graphitized&#8208;N produced during calcination also could provide more active sites and increase the electrical conductivity. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (OER/ORR) based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon. Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows more advantageous &#916;E value (0.70&#8197;V) compared to Pt/C+RuO2 (0.73&#8197;V) and most reported catalysts. Additionally, the zinc&#8208;air bbatterie (ZAB) employing Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC as air cathode shows excellent performance. The maximum power density of 203.48&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the cycling stability of more than 150&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P@NC catalyst shows more advantageous &#916;E value (0.70&#8197;V) compared to Pt/C+RuO2 (0.73&#8197;V) and most reported catalysts. Additionally, the zinc-air bbatterie (ZAB) employing V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P@NC as air cathode shows excellent performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Hybrid Prodrug for the Self&#8208;Immolative Delivery of an Anticancer Agent and Hydrogen Sulfide with Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence</title>

Adjuvant drug delivery: Dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based turn&#8208;on fluorogenic prodrug AM&#8208;TCB was developed for the adjuvant delivery of the naphthalimide amine&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide and the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The adjuvant release of H2S helps in ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorogenic prodrugs are advantageous for the targeted drug delivery enabling real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive monitoring with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. We report herein the dual&#8208;stimuli (ROS and CA)&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based prodrug (AM&#8208;TCB) for the turn&#8208;on fluorogenic delivery of the naphthalimide&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide along with the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). A carbamate&#8208;based prodrug AM&#8208;CB was also designed, capable of releasing the anticancer agent amonafide without any H2S. The prodrugs were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis. UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic studies revealed selective reactivity of the boronate ester group of prodrugs towards ROS (primarily H2O2) with the release of amonafide and COS/CO2 via self&#8208;immolative processes. Hydrolysis of the generated COS by carbonic anhydrase (CA) produces H2S. While the prodrug AM&#8208;TCB retained the anticancer activity of free amonafide in cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HeLa), unlike amonafide, it enhanced the cellular viability of the non&#8208;malignant cells (HEK&#8208;293). Fluorescence imaging in HeLa cells revealed the simultaneous delivery of the anticancer agent and H2S from AM&#8208;TCB with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Western blot studies further revealed the cytoprotective effects of the released H2S from AM&#8208;TCB. The present adjuvant strategy therefore would be helpful in future for ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.

         <title>&#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry for the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide with Phosphorus Dendrons: Synthesis, Characterization and Preliminary Biological Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several dendrons were functionalized on their surface by different types of pyridine&#8208;imine functions, and at their core by either azide or alkyne. These dendrons were grafted to graphene oxide (GO) via &#8220;click&#8221; reactions between azide or alkyne at their core, and alkynes or azides on the surface of GO, respectively. The biological properties of these new materials were tested.







Abstract
Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized. These dendrons were grafted via click reaction to graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with either alkyne or azide functions, respectively. The resulting modified&#8208;GO and GO&#8208;dendrons materials have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR) analyses. In addition, the free dendrons and the dendrons grafted to GO were tested toward cancerous (HCT116) and non&#8208;cancerous (RPE1) cell lines.

         <title>Reductive Activation of Aryl Chlorides by Tuning the Radical Cation Properties of N&#8208;Phenylphenothiazines as Organophotoredox Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>

Two photons are better than one: Intramolecular charge transfer in the intermediate radical cation of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines as photocatalysts improves the yields for borylation and phosphonylation of aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Aryl chlorides as substrates for arylations present a particular challenge for photoredox catalytic activation due to their strong C(sp2)&#8722;Cl bond and their strong reduction potential. Electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, as organophotoredox catalysts, are capable of cleaving aryl chlorides simply by photoinduced electron transfer without the need for an additional electrochemical activation setup or any other advanced photocatalysis technique. Due to the extremely strong reduction potential in the excited state of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines the substrate scope is high and includes aryl chlorides both with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substituents. We evidence this reactivity for photocatalytic borylations and phosphonylations. Advanced time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry was the key to elucidating and comparing the unusual photophysical properties not only of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, but also of their cation radicals as the central intermediates in the photocatalytic cycle. The revealed photophysics allowed the excited&#8208;state and radical&#8208;cation properties to be fine&#8208;tuned by the molecular design of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines; this improved the photocatalytic activity.

         <dc:description>
A methodological approach for the preparation of unconventional DTE&#8208;based photochromic phosphines is reported. It relies on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a silirene.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphines with light controlled basicity is presented in this study. A methodological approach for the preparation of these unconventional photochromic phosphines based on a dithienylethene organic moiety is reported. It relies on the palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a 2,3&#8208;Dithienylsilacyclopropene. Accordingly, a diphenyphosphino moiety is connected to the organic photochrome thanks to different linkers. Their influence on the photochromism and on the phosphinyl group basicity is studied and evaluated based on experimental an NMR descriptor as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical proteomics approach for non&#8208;linear polyphosphates: Pull&#8208;down probes of non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, were developed to explore the elusive interactome of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. Application to yeast cell extracts provided datasets of potential interactors. In addition, condensation reactions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates were studied in this work.







Abstract
Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non&#8208;linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts. We identify putative interactors with overlapping hits for structurally related capture compounds underlining the quality of our results. The datasets serve as starting point to study the biological relevance and functions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. In addition, we examine the reactivity of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates with implications for their &#8220;hydrolysable&#8221; analogues: Efforts to increase the ring&#8208;sizes of meta&#8208; or cyclic ultraphosphonates revealed a strong preference to form trimetaphosphate&#8208;analogue structures by cyclization and/or ring&#8208;contraction. Using carbodiimides for condensation, the so far inaccessible dianhydro product of ultraphosphonate, corresponding to P4O112&#8722;, was selectively obtained and then ring&#8208;opened by different nucleophiles yielding modified cyclic ultraphosphonates.

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Graphene Oxide: Unveiling Structural Properties and Electrochemical Performance</title>

Between the sheets: The Intercalation&#8208;Exfoliation (I&#8208;E) method was successfully applied to produce graphene oxide (GO) materials with adjustable oxidation levels, defect density, and crystallite size by tuning applied potential and electrolyte concentration. Investigating the electrochemical properties of these GO samples via CV and EIS measurements with a selected redox probe establishes meaningful correlations between their structural features and performance.







Abstract
An electrochemical exfoliation method for the production of graphene oxide and its characterization by electrochemical techniques are presented here. Graphite rods are used as working electrode in a three&#8208;electrode electrochemical cell, and electro&#8208;exfoliation is achieved by applying anodic polarization in a sulfuric acid solution. The electrochemical process involved two steps characterized by an intercalation at lower potential and an exfoliation at higher potential. The electrochemical behavior of the produced GO is studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X ray Photoelectronic Spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are employed to characterize the structural and chemical properties of the exfoliated GO. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical exfoliation method yields GO materials with varying degrees of oxidation, defect density, and crystallite size, depending on the applied potential and acid concentration. The graphene oxide samples exhibited distinct electrochemical properties, including charge transfer resistance, interfacial capacitance, and relaxation times for the charge transfer, as revealed by CV and EIS measurements with a specifically selected redox probe. The comprehensive characterization performed provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of the GO materials synthesized through electrochemical exfoliation of graphite.

         <title>Dispersing LiCl in Zwitterionic COF for Highly Efficient Ammonia Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic covalent organic frameworks (COF) is proposed as a porous hosts to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation. The anionic and cationic groups in zwitterionic COF act as two separated positive and negative charged sites to facilitate the dispersion of lithium chloride, which makes LiCl doped zwitterionic COF exhibit excellent NH3 capture performance.







Abstract
Efficient and inherently safe NH3 storage and separation are of significant importance for the chemical industry. Herein, we proposed zwitterionic COF as a porous host to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation with record adsorption capacity. The equivalently cationic and anionic groups in the channels of zwitterionic COF could act as two separated sites to facilitate the dispersion of LiCl, hence the optimal composite exhibits a high capture capacity of 44.98&#8197;mmol/g at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, far exceeding other existing porous materials. Notably, the adsorption capacity is completely reversible and the efficient separation of NH3 from NH3/CO2/N2 mixture is achieved through breakthrough experiments. DFT calculation combined with XPS and 7Li&#8197;NMR experimental results give insight into the interaction between zwitterionic COF and LiCl. This work extends possibilities for the development of efficient adsorbents for NH3 storage and separation.

         <title>Aluminium and Gallium Silylimides as Nitride Sources
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal aluminium and gallium silylimides have been accessed for the first time by exploiting the oxidative reactions of anionic aluminium(I)/gallium(I) (&#8216;aluminyl&#8217;/&#8217;gallyl&#8217;) reagent with silylazides. These compounds feature minimal M=N &#960;&#8208;bonding and can be shown to act as sources of the nitride ion, [N]3&#8722; in reactions with CO or N2O.







Abstract
Terminal aluminium and gallium imides of the type K[(NON)M(NR)], bearing heteroatom substituents at R, have been synthesised via reactions of anionic aluminium(I) and gallium(I) reagents with silyl and boryl azides (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;anilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene). These systems vary significantly in their lability in solution: the N(SiiPr3) and N(Boryl) complexes are very labile, on account of the high basicity at nitrogen. Phenylsilylimido derivatives provide greater stabilization through the &#960;&#8208;acceptor capabilities of the SiR3 group. K[(NON)AlN(SitBuPh2)] offers a workable compromise between stability and solubility, and has been completely characterized by spectroscopic, analytical and crystallographic methods. The silylimide species examined feature minimal &#960;&#8208;bonding between the imide ligand and aluminium/gallium, with the HOMO and HOMO&#8208;1 orbitals effectively comprising orthogonal lone pairs centred at N. Reactivity&#8208;wise, both aluminium and gallium silylimides can act as viable sources of nitride, [N]3&#8722;, with systems derived from either metal reacting with CO to afford cyanide complexes. By contrast, only the gallium system K[(NON)Ga{N(SiPh3)}] is capable of effecting a similar transformation with N2O to yield azide, N3&#8722;, via formal oxide/nitride metathesis. The aluminium systems instead generate RN3 via transfer of the imide fragment [RN]2&#8722;.

Racemization mechanisms of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 complexes were unraveled using MoO2(acnac)2 as a model. The cis(NN) isomer is the global energy minimum and racemizes via a three&#8208;step mechanism DML&#8594; CH&#8594;DML, which serves as prototype for racemizing MX2(a&#8208;chel)2.







Abstract
Octahedral chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 (a&#8208;chel=asymmetric chelate) can rearrange their ligands by four mechanisms known as the Bailar (B), Ray&#8208;Dutt (RD), Conte&#8208;Hippler (CH), and Dhimba&#8208;Muller&#8208;Lammertsma (DML) twists. Racemization involves their interconnections, which were computed for MoO2(acnac)2 (acnac=&#946;&#8208;ketoiminate) using density functional theory at &#969;B97x&#8208;D with the 6&#8208;31G(d,p) and 6&#8208;311G(2d,p) basis sets and LANL2DZ for molybdenum. Racemizing the cis(NN) isomer, being the global energy minimum with trans oriented imine groups, is a three step process (DML&#8208;CH&#8208;DML) that requires 17.4&#8197;kcal/mol, while all three cis isomers (cis(NN), cis(NO), and cis(OO)) interconvert at &#8804;17.9&#8197;kcal/mol. The B and RD twists are energetically not competitive and neither are the trans isomers. The interconnection of all enantiomeric minima and transition structures is summarized in a graph that also visualizes valley ridge inflection points for two of the three CH twists. Geometrical features of the minima and twists are given. Lastly, the influence of N&#8208;substitution on the favored racemization pathway is evaluated. The present comprehensive study serves as a template for designing chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 catalysts that may retain their chiral integrity.

         <title>Reversible Binding of Hydrogen and Styrene Coordination on a Manganese Phosphenium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;photolysis of two simple N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium complexes with H2 proceeds in one case under cooperative addition of H2 across the P=Mn double bond and in the other case via decarbonylation without participation of H2. The origin of this divergence and preliminary results on the passing on of the H2 molecule to styrene are discussed.







Abstract
The reactions of two complexes [(RNHP)Mn(CO)4] (RNHP=N&#8208;arylated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium) with H2 at elevated pressure (&#8776;4&#8197;bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (5&#8201;a, R=Dipp) the unselective formation of (RNHP&#8208;H)MnH(CO)4] (6&#8201;a) via cooperative addition of H2 across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (5&#8201;b, R=Mes), addition of H2 was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(RNHP)2Mn2(CO)7] (7&#8201;b) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H2, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to 7&#8201;a,b as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that 7&#8201;b is unreactive towards both H2 and CO while 7&#8201;a is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion. Preliminary studies suggest further that 5&#8201;a/H2 as well as 6&#8201;a enable the photo&#8208;induced hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene, even if the mechanism and possibly catalytic nature of this process remain yet unknown.

         <title>Dipolarophile&#8208;Steered Formal Stereodivergent Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans&#8208;Pyrrolidines Based on Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Lactones</title>

         <dc:description>
The formal diastereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines was achieved by using a different type of activated alkenes. The silver complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of imino lactones with ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones, and subsequent transformation afforded chiral pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans diastereoselectivity. In contrast, 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines were obtained by the reaction of imino lactones with acyclic enones.







Abstract
The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;trans/cis pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(S,Sp)&#8208;iPr&#8208;FcPHOX&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5&#8208;trans selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(R,Sp)&#8208;ThioClickFerrophos complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and enantioselectivities. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines.

Group I alkoxides and amylates efficiently catalyze the heterodehydrocoupling of challenging silane and amine substrates under mild conditions! This represents one of the most straightforward and accessible methods to form aminosilanes through heterodehydrocoupling! This train is now leaving the station &#8211; don't miss it!







Abstract
Group I alkoxides are highly active precatalysts in the heterodehydrocoupling of silanes and amines to afford aminosilane products. The broadly soluble and commercially available KOtAmyl was utilized as the benchmark precatalyst for this transformation. Challenging substrates such as anilines were found to readily couple primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes in high conversions (&gt;90&#8201;%) after only 2&#8197;h at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Traditionally challenging silanes such as Ph3SiH were also easily coupled to simple primary and secondary amines under mild conditions, with reactivity that rivals many rare earth and transition&#8208;metal catalysts for this transformation. Preliminary evidence suggests the formation of hypercoordinated intermediates, but radicals were detected under catalytic conditions, indicating a mechanism that is rare for Si&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Quinone Compounds Derived from Doubly and Triply Linked Diporphyrins and Tuning of Their Absorption Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel quinones derived from two types of diporphyrins (diporphyrinquinones D and T) have been synthesized and characterized. D exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties with significant red&#8208;shifts to 1300&#8197;nm upon metalation, whereas T exhibits intense and sharp absorption bands, along with a small absorption peak at longer wavelengths.







Abstract
Porphyrins are attracting increasing attention in materials science and photochemistry owing to their unique properties and diverse applications. This study focuses on modifying and tuning the absorption properties of porphyrins, specifically those of quinoidal porphyrins, to extend their spectral range into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. We report the synthesis and structural and physical properties of quinone compounds derived from doubly and triply linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes. Doubly linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties in solution owing to its low symmetry. Metal complexation markedly extends its absorption range into the near&#8208;infrared region. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. The longest absorption wavelength of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones was approximately 1500&#8197;nm, which was significantly more red&#8208;shifted than that of the doubly linked ones.

Ring opening of hexamethylcyclotrisoloxane with BeBr2, BeI2 and BePh2 was observed. These reactions yielded previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates, [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4] and [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4], respectively, as well as [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. Hydrolysis of these beryllium silanolates revealed that dimethyl bromo and iodo silanol are unstable and react to various cyclic cyclosiloxanes.







Abstract
The reactivity of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3) towards BeCl2, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6]3 was investigated. While BeCl2 only showed unselective reactivity, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6] cleanly react to the trinuclear complexes [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4], [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4] and [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. These unprecedented bromide, iodide and phenyl transfer reactions from a group II metal onto silicon offer a versatile access to previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Reduction of Disulfides in an Undivided Cell under Mass Transfer Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reductive cleavage of disulfides has been accomplished without the need for sacrificial metal anodes or a divided cell. Excellent conversion and selectivity toward the corresponding thiol can be achieved by tuning the current density at the electrodes. Very high current density at the anode creates a mass transfer barrier that impedes re&#8208;oxidation of the thiol generated at the cathode.







Abstract
Electroorganic synthesis is generally considered to be a green alternative to conventional redox reactions. Electrochemical reductions, however, are less advantageous in terms of sustainability, as sacrificial metal anodes are often employed. Divided cell operation avoids contact of the reduction products with the anode and allows for convenient solvent oxidation, enabling metal free greener electrochemical reductions. However, the ion exchange membranes required for divided cell operation on a commercial scale are not amenable to organic solvents, which hinders their applicability. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of oxidatively sensitive compounds can be carried out in an undivided cell without sacrificial metal anodes by controlling the mass transport to a small surface area electrode. The concept is showcased by an electrochemical method for the reductive cleavage of aryl disulfides. Fine tuning of the electrode surface area and current density has enabled the preparation of a wide variety of thiols without formation of any oxidation side products. This strategy is anticipated to encourage further research on greener, metal free electrochemical reductions.

The rGO layer on electrode exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC, DEC, and K+&#8208;ions, regulating the EDL around electrode. The special behavior changes the SEI and markedly improves the reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, rGO with robust mechanical properties remains the integrity of SEI and FeSe/C@rGO electrode. Under these synergies, the anode exhibits excellent potassium storage properties.







Abstract
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity. However, the impact of rGO on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+&#8208;ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+&#8208;ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086&#8201;% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1.

The activity of potassium alkoxides salts in N&#8722;Si dehydrocoupling catalysis is out of this world! For the first time, aniline derivatives are now accessible substrates in N&#8722;Si dehydrocoupling catalysis, and relative rates of reactions for benchmark substrate are substantially greater for KOtAmyl than reported catalysts. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Waterman and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302618).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The activity of potassium alkoxides salts&lt;/b&gt; in N&#8722;Si dehydrocoupling &lt;i&gt;cat&lt;/i&gt;alysis is out of this world! For the first time, aniline derivatives are now accessible substrates in N&#8722;Si dehydrocoupling catalysis, and relative rates of reactions for benchmark substrate are substantially greater for KOtAmyl than reported catalysts.

         <title>Cover Feature: Synthesis and Characterization of Quinone Compounds Derived from Doubly and Triply Linked Diporphyrins and Tuning of Their Absorption Properties (Chem. Eur. J. 66/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel quinone compounds derived from doubly and triply linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes have been synthesized and characterized. Doubly linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties with significant red&#8208;shifts to 1300&#8197;nm upon metalation. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;i. Yamashita, D. Hirano, and K.&#8208;i. Sugiura (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302637).

Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal racemization has been unraveled for MoO2(acnac)2 by using density functional theory. Nine energy minima, 13 transition structures, and all intrinsic reaction coordinates were identified. The kudu's antlers show the three sets enantiomers for cis&#8208;MoO2(acnac)2. Each antler reflects their chiral isomerization by DML twists. The horizontal lines connecting the antlers reflect chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal racemization for each enantiomer by CH twists.

         <title>Bioinspired Non&#8208;Heme Mn Catalysts for Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Oxyfunctionalizations with H2O2</title>

Mn catalyzed C&#8208;H activation: In recent years, Mn based catalysts have been at the forefront of direct oxidative functionalization of organic compounds with hydrogen peroxide. This contribution surveys the progress in this emerging area, achieved in the past five years, with focus on the possibilities for tuning the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity of these catalyst systems.







Abstract
In recent years, metalloenzymes&#8208;mediated highly selective oxidations of organic substrates under mild conditions have been inspiration for developing synthetic bioinspired catalyst systems, capable of conducting such processes in the laboratory (and, in the future, in industry), relying on easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and environmentally benign oxidants such as H2O2. To date, non&#8208;heme manganese complexes with chiral bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl and structurally related ligands are considered as possessing the highest synthetic potential, having demonstrated the ability to mediate a variety of chemo&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative transformations, such as epoxidations, C(sp3)&#8208;H hydroxylations and ketonizations, oxidative desymmetrizations, kinetic resolutions, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years non&#8208;heme Mn based catalysts have become the major platform for studies focused on getting insight into the molecular mechanisms of oxidant activation and (stereo)selective oxygen transfer, testing non&#8208;traditional hydroperoxide oxidants, engineering catalytic sites with enzyme&#8208;like substrate recognition&#8208;based selectivity, exploration of catalytic regioselectivity trends in the oxidation of biologically active substrates of natural origin. This contribution summarizes the progress in manganese catalyzed C&#8208;H oxygenative transformations of organic substrates, achieved essentially in the past 5&#8197;years (late 2018&#8211;2023).

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 66, November 24, 2023. </description>

Representative synthetic approaches and applications of 2D kgm COFs are summarized in this Review. The specific pore structure of kgm topology exhibits unique superiority in selective adsorption, mass diffusion, and exciton migration, which will facilitate the development and provide more opportunities for 2D COFs.







Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks with Kagome (kgm) topology are a promising class of crystalline frameworks that possess both triangular and hexagonal pores. These dual&#8208;pore structures enable kgm COFs to exhibit unique advantages in selective separation, mass transfer, and targeted drug release. However, the synthesis of 2D kgm COFs has been hindered by the reliance on empirical methods. This review systematically summarizes the conventional macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework strategy, typical [4+2] co&#8208;polymerization synthetic strategy, and bifunctional molecules self&#8208;condensation approach for constructing 2D kgm COFs. Factors influencing the formation of kgm lattice are surveyed, such as monomer type, solvent polarity, substrate concentration, etc., and highlight the representative examples on targeted synthesis. Additionally, applications of 2D kgm COFs and relationships between structure and performances are summarized. Finally, key fundamental perspectives are proposed to accelerate the further development of this intriguing material.

&#8220;Eliminating expensive chiral ligands requires chiral integrity of the metal center, which necessitates an understanding of how to control its octahedral coordination sphere with two simple chelates.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202302516).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Koop Lammertsma and co&#8208;workers at the University of Johannesburg and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The image of the kudu's antlers depicts the isomerization and racemization of the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex MoO2(acnac)2 (acnac=&#946;&#8208;ketoiminate).

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;Eliminating expensive chiral ligands requires chiral integrity of the metal center, which necessitates an understanding of how to control its octahedral coordination sphere with two simple chelates&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202302516"&gt;10.1002/chem.202302516&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Trifluoroethylation and Pentafluoropropylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluorinated substituents often enhance effectiveness, improve the stability within metabolic processes, and boost the lipophilicity of biologically active compounds. However, methods for their introduction into aliphatic carbon chains remain very limited. A potentially general route to integrate the fluorinated scaffolds into organic molecules involves insertion of fluorine&#8208;containing carbenes into C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. The electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of perfluoroalkyl groups enhances the reactivity of these carbenes which should enable the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. Curiously, it appears that use of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing carbenes in alkane C&#8211;H functionalization is exceedingly rare. This concept describes photolysis, enzymatic catalysis, and transition metal catalysis as three primary approaches to C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization by trifluoromethylcarbene and its homologues.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in synthesis and application.







Abstract
Diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo compounds have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in organic synthesis.

         <title>Doubly Bridged Anthracenes: Blue Emitters for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bridged anthracenes was synthesized and their photostabilities were accessed. While the length of the bridges only plays a minor role, introduction of electron withdrawing ester&#8208;based linkers retards photooxidation most. Those esters bridged anthracenes could be prepared in reasonable yields and &#8220;proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle&#8221; organic light emitting diodes with deep blue emission were built, demonstrating their potential as emitters.







Abstract
The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester&#8208;based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Double ester&#8208;bridging allows deep blue electro&#8208;luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and achievement of using IL&#8208;confinement in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium metal batteries are surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, and the influence of specific parameters was discussed, indicating that the IL&#8208;confinement improves the performance of electrolytes, and the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent.







Abstract
The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL&#8208;confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, that is, the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Vibronic Coupling Controls the Intersystem Crossing of Iodine&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Triplet Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY dyes, extensively used as triplet chromophores, have unique electronic structure with strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In this experimental and computational study, we explain the control of intersystem crossing of BODIPY triplet chromophores by spin&#8208;vibronic coupling. We rationalize the site&#8208;specific effect of heavy atom substitution by extending El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.







Abstract
4,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;borata&#8208;3a&#8208;azonia&#8208;4a&#8208;aza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) dyes are extensively used in various applications of their triplet states, ranging from photoredox catalysis, through triplet sensitization to photodynamic therapy. However, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores by ab initio modelling is limited by their strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In particular, spin&#8208;vibronic coupling is often overlooked when estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. In this study, a combined experimental and theoretical approach using spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to correctly describe ISC in BODIPY dyes was developed. For this purpose, seven &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY derivatives with iodine atoms in different positions were examined. It was found that the heavy&#8208;atom effect of iodine atoms is site specific, causing high triplet yields in only some positions. This site&#8208;specific ISC was explained by El&#8208;Sayed rules, so both the contribution and character of the molecular orbitals involved in the excitation must be considered when predicting the ISC rates. Overall, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores requires using (i)&#8197;the high&#8208;quality electronic structure theory, including both static and dynamical correlations; and (ii)&#8197;the two&#8208;component wave function Hamiltonian, and rationalizing; and (iii)&#8197;ISC based on the character of the molecular orbitals of heavy atoms involved in the excitation, expanding El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.

         <title>Glycerol Oligomerization over Titania&#8208;Based Catalyst Compositions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of TiO2 with sulfonic groups causes the appearance of catalytic activity with the formation of a wide range of polyglycerides. Fabrication of a composite of sulfated titania with carbon nanotubes limits the spectrum of products with short&#8208;chain linear glycerides. Thus, it gives a promising way to obtain a selective catalyst for the processing of glycerol into short&#8208;chain polyglycerides.







Abstract
The possibility of using TiO2&#8208;based compositions: individual and sulfated titania, and their composites with carbon nanotubes as catalysts for glycerol oligomerization has been displayed. The effect of modification of TiO2 with sulfur and carbon nanotubes on acid&#8208;base and catalytic characteristics in the glycerol conversion was investigated. The activation of glycerol on the catalysts has been studied using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Only the samples based on sulfated titania are active over glycerol transformation, showing up to 58.7&#8201;% conversion. This is explained by the presence of strong base sites. Glycerides up to pentaglycerides, both linear and nonlinear structure are formed by glycerol oligomerization over TiO2&#8722;S. The addition of nanotubes to the catalyst reduces both the glycerol conversion (up to 10.5&#8201;%) and the yield of glycerides. However, the spectrum of the resulting products is significantly narrowed, increasing the selectivity for short&#8208;chain glycerides: the portion of diglycerides reaches 72&#8201;%, and triglycerides 21&#8201;%. Herewith, glycerides of a linear structure only formed.

         <title>Robust Spin Liquidity in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3 (HHTP)2 with S=1/2 Kagome Lattice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique synthetic approach is implemented to crystallize a Cu(II)&#8208;based 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) leading to electron doping via chemical interaction between two sublattices, magnetic and electronic, resulting in the 200&#8208;fold increase in electrical conductivity along with the presence of robust spin liquidity.







Abstract
On one hand electron or hole doping of quantum spin liquid (QSL) may unlock high&#8208;temperature superconductivity and on the other hand it can disrupt the spin liquidity, giving rise to a magnetically ordered ground state. Recently, a 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP &#8208; 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene), containing Cu(II) S=
 frustrated spins in the Kagome lattice is emerging as a promising QSL candidate. Herein, we present an elegant in&#8197;situ redox&#8208;chemistry strategy of anchoring Cu3(HHTP)2 crystallites onto diamagnetic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, resulting in the formation of electron&#8208;doped Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite which exhibited a characteristic semiconducting behavior (5&#8197;K to 300&#8197;K) with high electrical conductivity of 70&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a carrier density of ~1.1&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 at 300&#8197;K. Remarkably, no magnetic transition in the Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite was observed down to 1.5&#8197;K endorsing the robust spin liquidity of the 2D MOF Cu3(HHTP)2. Specific heat capacity measurements led to the estimation of the residual entropy values of 28&#8201;% and 34&#8201;% of the theoretically expected value for the pristine Cu3(HHTP)2 and Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite, establishing the presence of strong quantum fluctuations down to 1.5&#8197;K (two times smaller than the value of the exchange interaction J).

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the synthesis of glycosyl luciferins and their potential for determining glycosidase activity. Two novel synthetic routes were developed that were used to introduce the luciferin moiety in a late&#8208;stage of the sequence and the linear range of the glycosidase assays and kinetics of the substrates were determined.







Abstract
Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon the in&#8197;situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75&#8201;%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.

Herein, we have reported a one&#8208;pot oxidant&#8208;controlled synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles, along with two rare heterocycles viz. indazoloindazolediones and indazolobenzoxazines from 2&#8208;arylindazoles through Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization followed by oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ and switching from DDQ to selectfluor, with broad range of substrates scope.







Abstract
The oxidant&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles and indazoloindazolediones has been developed through Mn(I)&#8208; catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization of 2H&#8208;indazoles with para&#8208;formaldehyde to afford C&#8208;2&#8242; hydroxymethylated 2H&#8208;indazoles and subsequently oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ in one&#8208;pot. By employing selectfluor as the oxidant instead of DDQ, this reaction exclusively provided indazolebenzoxazine derivatives. This strategy delivered unsymmetrical indazoloindazoledione and indazolobenzoxazine with varied functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Porous Carbon Foam with Carbon Nanotubes as Cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon foam with carbon nanotubes were elaborately designed and fabricated by using cobalt as the catalyst and utilized as cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The unique structure can enhance the decomposition rate of lithium carbonate, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO2 battery.







Abstract
With the extensive use of fossil fuels, the ever&#8208;increasing greenhouse gas of mainly carbon dioxide emissions will result in global climate change. It is of utmost importance to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and its utilization. Li&#8722;CO2 batteries can convert carbon dioxide into electrochemical energy. However, developing efficient catalysts for the decomposition of Li2CO3 as the discharge product represents a challenge in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Porous carbon foam with carbon nanotubes were elaborately designed and fabricated by using cobalt as the catalyst and utilized as cathode for Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery. The unique structure can enhance the decomposition rate of lithium carbonate, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the extensive use of fossil fuels, the ever-increasing greenhouse gas of mainly carbon dioxide emissions will result in global climate change. It is of utmost importance to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and its utilization. Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries can convert carbon dioxide into electrochemical energy. However, developing efficient catalysts for the decomposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the discharge product represents a challenge in Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a carbon foam composite with growing carbon nanotube by using cobalt as the catalyst, showing the ability to enhance the decomposition rate of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Benefiting from its abundant pore structure and catalytic sites, the as-assembled Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery exhibits a desirable overpotential of 1.67&#8197;V after 50&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the overpotentials are 1.05 and 2.38&#8197;V at current densities of 0.02 and 0.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. These results provide a new avenue for the development of efficient catalysts for Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special feature of the small metal&#8208;free electrophilic anion [B6X5]&#8722; is nitrogen activation through &#960;&#8208;backbonding. The &#960;&#8208;backbonding predicted by EDA ETS&#8208;NOCV and detected by IR spectroscopy as a red shift of the bound N2 vibrational frequency is shown as a cartoon &#8220;boxing match&#8221; between N2 (blue glove, &#963;&#8208;donation) and [B6Cl5]&#8208; (red gloves, &#960;&#8208;backdonation). The measured spectrum is shown on the outer surface of the boxing ring. Further information, including interaction with CO and H2O and comparison with [B12X11]&#8722;, can be found in the Research Article by J. Warneke and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302247).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To comprehend the significance of improved conductive properties in C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogels, it is vital to investigate how non&#8208;gelating achiral functional group isomers influence the conductivity of such supramolecular hydrogels, whereas understanding the major driving forces behind this regulatory process is first and foremost. Herein, we report a hydrogel system containing tryptophan&#8208;conjugated NDI as the backbone (L/D&#8208;NTrp), enabling effective supramolecular assembly with the bipyridyl functional group isomers. This co&#8208;assembly behavior results in materials with exceptional mechanical properties and high conductivities, surpassing most previously reported C2&#8208;symmetrical hydrogels, as well as the ability to form controlled morphologies. Notably, the co&#8208;hydrogels displayed an eight&#8208;fold increase in mechanical strength, making them more robust and resistant to deformation compared to the original gel. Additionally, all hydrogels exhibited favorable electrical conductivity, with the co&#8208;assembled hydrogels showcasing notable performance, making them a promising candidate for use in electronic devices and sensors. This report lays the foundation for further investigation into the properties and potential applications of L/D&#8208;NTrp compound in the range of fields, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Network based on Electrophilic Substitution (ES) Adduct of Furan&#8208;Triazolinedione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers with furan functionality have been the subject of extensive research on developing sustainable materials applying a limited number of dynamic covalent approaches. Herein, we introduce a facile, dynamic non&#8208;covalent approach to make a furan polymer readily accessible for self&#8208;healing applications based on its electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD). A tailor&#8208;made furan polymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA), considering it an initial illustrative example, was rapidly ES modified with PTAD to produce furfuryl&#8208;tagged triazolidine that subsequently associated via inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen (H&#8208;) bonding to produce a thermally reversible supramolecular polymer network under ambient conditions. The H&#8208;bonded network was experimentally quantified via ATR&#8208;IR analysis and theoretically rationalized via the density functional theory (DFT) study using smaller organic model compounds analogous to the macromolecular system. Thermoreversible feature of the H&#8208;bonded triazolidine&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer network enabled the solution reprocessing and self&#8208;healing of the polymer material.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive release of cytochalasin intermediates was studied in&#8197;vitro, showing that the R&#8208;domain requires a T&#8208;domain tethered substrate, but has low selectivity for the amino acid and polyketide moieties. Direct 2&#8208;electron reduction is the preferred mode of release, followed by rapid Knoevenagel cyclisation of the released aldehyde.







Abstract
Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in&#8197;vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.

         <title>Improving In Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Efficacy of Platinum Antitumor Agents by Electronic Tuning of the Kinetic Lability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systemic study highlights the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies of platinum complexes comprising of &#8216;O&#708;O&#8217; leaving ligand, in addition to demonstrating that along with other physicochemical properties, kinetic lability tuning is crucial for improving in&#8197;vivo tumor accumulation and efficacy of newly designed functional Pt antitumor agents.







Abstract
The impact of kinetic lability or reactivity on in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity, stability in plasma, in&#8197;vivo tumor and tissue accumulation, and antitumor efficacy of functional platinum(II) (Pt) anticancer agents containing a O&#708;O &#946;&#8208;diketonate leaving ligand remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we synthesized Pt complexes [(NH3)2Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, DACH=1R,2R&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) containing an electron deficient [L1&#8208;H]&#8211; O&#708;O leaving ligand and [(NH3)2Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 (L2=1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione) containing an electron&#8208;rich [L2&#8208;H]&#8211; O&#708;O leaving ligand. While all four complexes have comparable lipophilicity, the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing CF3 group was found to dramatically enhance the reactivity of these complexes toward nucleophilic biomolecules. In vitro cellular assays revealed that the more reactive complexes have higher cellular uptake and higher anticancer potency as compared to their less reactive analogs. But the scenario is opposite in&#8197;vivo, where the less reactive complex showed improved tissue and tumor accumulation and better anticancer efficacy in mice bearing ovarian xenograft when compared to its more reactive analog. Finally, in addition to demonstrating the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies, we also described the impact of kinetic lability on the mechanism of action of this class of promising antitumor agents.

     alt="Improving In Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Efficacy of Platinum Antitumor Agents by Electronic Tuning of the Kinetic Lability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This systemic study highlights the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies of platinum complexes comprising of &#8216;O&#708;O&#8217; leaving ligand, in addition to demonstrating that along with other physicochemical properties, kinetic lability tuning is crucial for improving in&#8197;vivo tumor accumulation and efficacy of newly designed functional Pt antitumor agents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of kinetic lability or reactivity on in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity, stability in plasma, in&#8197;vivo tumor and tissue accumulation, and antitumor efficacy of functional platinum(II) (Pt) anticancer agents containing a O&#708;O &#946;-diketonate leaving ligand remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we synthesized Pt complexes [(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;-H)]NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [(DACH)Pt(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;-H)]NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;L1=&lt;/b&gt;4,4,4-trifluoro-1-ferrocenylbutane-1,3-dione, DACH=1&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine) containing an electron deficient [&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;-H]&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; O&#708;O leaving ligand and [(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;-H)]NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [(DACH)Pt(&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;-H)]NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;=1-ferrocenylbutane-1,3-dione) containing an electron-rich [&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;-H]&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; O&#708;O leaving ligand. While all four complexes have comparable lipophilicity, the presence of the electron-withdrawing CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group was found to dramatically enhance the reactivity of these complexes toward nucleophilic biomolecules. In vitro cellular assays revealed that the more reactive complexes have higher cellular uptake and higher anticancer potency as compared to their less reactive analogs. But the scenario is opposite in&#8197;vivo, where the less reactive complex showed improved tissue and tumor accumulation and better anticancer efficacy in mice bearing ovarian xenograft when compared to its more reactive analog. Finally, in addition to demonstrating the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies, we also described the impact of kinetic lability on the mechanism of action of this class of promising antitumor agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Altering the Localization of an Unpaired Spin in a Formal Ni(V) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fate of unpaired spin localization on a formal Ni(V) species: This work broadens the scope of the previously reported a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species by revealing how modest adjustments to the ligand field and temperature can determine the fate of localization of an unpaired spin on a previously unknown three oxidized equivalent species.







Abstract
The participation of both ligand and the metal center in the redox events has been recognized as one of the ways to attain the formal high valent complexes for the late 3d metals, such as Ni and Cu. Such an approach has been employed successfully to stabilize a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species in which there exist an equilibrium between the ligand and the Ni localized resultant spin. The present work, however, broadens the scope of the previously reported three oxidized equivalent species by conveying the approaches that tend to affect the reported equilibrium in CH3CN at 233&#8197;K. Various spectroscopic characterization revealed that employing exogenous N&#8208;donor ligands like 1&#8208;methyl imidazole and pyridine favors the formation of the Ni centered localized spin though axial binding. In contrast, due to its steric hinderance, quinoline favors an exclusive ligand localized radical species. DFT studies shed light on the novel intermediates&#8242; complex electronic structure. Further, the three oxidized equivalent species with the Ni centered spin was examined for its hydrogen atom abstraction ability stressing their key role in alike reactions.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties Through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of the dynamic effects in flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical towards engineering custom responsive materials. In this work, two novel families of flexible MOFs based on rare&#8208;earth metals were developed. The breathing capabilities and the eventual sorption properties change drastically by slight changes in the organic ligand, leading also to the emergence of unique gas and vapor sorption properties, including rare gas trapping phenomena.







Abstract
An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property. The synthesis of RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.

         <title>Unraveling the Push&#8208;Pull Effect in Acenes, Polyenes and Polyynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of the charge of the substituent active region allowed us to reveal how electron withdrawing and donating properties of polyene, polyyne and acene spacers change with their length. It is also shown how the substituent effect strength between two groups diminishes with distance. The effect of substituent on electron delocalization can be extracted using EDDB (Electron Density of Delocalized Bonds) differential maps.







Abstract
Substituent effects (SEs) are fundamental for predicting molecular reactivity, while polyene, polyyne and acene derivatives are precursors to compounds with diverse applications. Computations were performed for Y&#8208;R&#8208;X systems, where reaction sites Y=NO2 and O&#8722;, substituents X=NO2, CN, Cl, H, OH, NH2, and spacers R=polyene, polyyne (n=1&#8208;5, 10 repeating units) and acene (up to tetracene). The cSAR (charge of the substituent active region) approach allowed to present, for the first time, quantitative relations describing the spacer's electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing properties as a function of n and the spacer type. The electronic properties of the X substituents depend on the type of spacer, its length and the Y group, which is an example of the reverse SE. To describe how the SE between Y and X weakens with n, two approaches were compared: cSAR and SESE (SE stabilization energy). The EDDB (electron density of delocalized bonds) characterize changes in electron delocalization in spacers due to the SE. A new approach &#8211; EDDB differential maps &#8211; allow to extract the effect of X substitution on the electron delocalization. The charges at spacer's C atoms correlate with cSAR; changes in the slopes confirm the charge transfer by resonance.

         <title>Dibenzoindolo[1,8]naphthyridines: Synthesis and Characterization of X&#8208;Shaped Aza[4,6]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis strategy to obtain double [4]&#8208; and [6]&#8208;azahelicene structures with central 1,8&#8208;naphthyrinde core is described. Synthesis method allows four bond formation in one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step reaction with easy diversification of substituents. Experimental data of optical and electrochemical properties, as well as theoretical calculations of selected product examples, are presented.







Abstract
This report describes a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step procedure to obtain double azahelicenes via nucleophilic fluorine substitution of 2,2&#8208;di(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroalkenes and palladium&#8208;catalysed ring closing reaction. The developed synthesis approach allows easy diversification of substituents at all four fragments of the obtained X&#8208;shaped aza[4,6]helicene entity. Yields range from 20&#8201;% to 60&#8201;% among 12 product examples. X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis reveals formation of (P,P) and (M,M) enantiomer mixture of products. Optical and electrochemical properties of selected products were studied by performing UV/Vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry measurements. Experimental results are supported by (TD)&#8208;DFT, NICS and NICS2BC calculations.

         <title>Lanthanide Mimicking by Magnesium for Oxazolidinone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric magnesium compound was employed as a catalyst for the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohol and isocyanate, resulting in the formation of pharmaceutically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This transformation, previously attributed solely to transition metals or lanthanides, signifies a noteworthy advancement.







Abstract
In the last decade, magnesium complexes have emerged as a viable alternative to transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated bonds. However, their potential for advanced catalytic reactions has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we have developed a novel magnesium amide compound (3) using a PNP framework that is both bulky and flexible. Our research demonstrates that compound 3 can effectively catalyze the synthesis of biologically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This synthesis involves a tandem reaction of hydroalkoxylation and cyclohydroamination of isocyanate using propargyl alcohol. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive theoretical calculations to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. It is important to note that these types of transformations have not been reported for magnesium and would significantly enhance the catalytic portfolio of the 7th most abundant element.

         <title>Advances in Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte/Li Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is essential for achieving both high energy density and enhanced safety in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A well&#8208;functioning ISE/Li interface plays a pivotal role in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. Poor interface contact and stability can lead to the deterioration of ASSLMB performance. Hence, various interface modification methods are employed to enhance the ISE/Li interface.







Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety energy storage devices has sparked a growing interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is a fundamental requirement for ASSLMBs, and an effective ISE/Li interface is a key factor in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. In this Concept, we initially summarize the challenges encountered by ISE/Li interfaces and delineate four commonly employed strategies for modifying the ISE/Li interface. Then, we explore the merits and drawbacks of coatings utilized as ISE/Li interfacial phases. We also delve into the commonly employed thermal bonding and innovative cold bonding methods utilized for in&#8197;situ interface preparation. Lastly, we spotlight future directions for enhancing the functionality of ISE/Li interfaces and achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Hindered, Regioselective Access to Multifunctional groups Diarylamines via SNAr Substitution of P&#8208;Nitroso Aromatic Methyl Ether by Arylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional groups diarylamines, an innovative product, efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. This SNAr proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and more significantly, the substrates involved do not necessarily require strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Moreover, this SNAr is characterized by resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso functional groups, and high regioselectivity. Mechanistic observations suggest that the SNAr is the result of the transfer of the positive charge center of the protonated nitroso group to the p&#8208;methoxy group.</dc:description>

         <title>A Primer On 2D Descriptors In Selectivity Modeling For Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and electronic and steric properties of catalysts. However, such models require quantum chemical calculations and are thus limited by their computational cost. Here, we highlight the recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates. While these have a less explicit mechanistic connection to the modeled property, 2D descriptors, such as topological indices, molecular fingerprints, and fragments, offer a tremendous advantage of low cost and high speed of calculations. This makes them optimal for in silico screening of large amount of data. We provide an overview of a common Quantitative Structure&#8208;Property Relationship (QSPR) workflow, model building and validation techniques, applications of these methodologies in asymmetric catalysis design, as well as the outlook on improving the understanding of 2D&#8208;based models.</dc:description>

         <title>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators integrated with the functions of electrical energy harvest and storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail. Finally, the future research directions and applications of smart actuators are prospected from our perspective.</dc:description>

Treatment of 1 with chlorodiphenyl phosphine (PPh2Cl) yielded 1,5&#8208;P,S chelated Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate species [PPh2H{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH(OH)L}Ru{&#954;2&#8208;P,S&#8208;(Ph2P)BH2L}], 2. The insertion of phosphine moiety (PPh2) by the cleavage of 3c&#8208;2e &#963;(Ru&#8230;H&#8208;B) bonding interaction led to the formation of B&#8208;P bond. The &#954;2&#8208;P,S chelated six&#8208;membered ring adopted a boat conformation in complex 2. The heterocycle is made of all different atoms, which is one of the rarest examples of heteroatomic ring systems. Theoretical outcomes demonstrated the electronic insight of B&#8208;P coupling and stabilization through transition metal. In order to explore an alternate route of B&#8208;P bond formation, we have further explored the reaction of 1 and Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complex, 5 with secondary phosphine oxide (SPO). Although, thermolysis of 1 with diphenylphosphine oxide yielded analogous &#963; &#8208;borate complex 3, the similar reaction of 5 at room temperature led to the formation of novel phosphinous(III) acid incorporated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 6. In a similar fashion, the reaction of 5 with phosphite ligand generated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 7, which is analogous to 6.</dc:description>

         <title>Diindolocarbazole&#8208;based Rigid Donor&#8208;acceptor TADF&#160;Molecules for Energy and Electron Transfer Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26 eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4 ns to 31 ns) and longer delayed components (36.4 ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8208;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~ 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerization and crowding in the binding of interleukin 8 to dendritic glycosaminoglycans as artificial proteoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) with proteins of the extracellular matrix govern and regulate complex physiological functions including cellular growth, immune response, and inflammation. Repetitive presentation of GAG binding motifs as found in native proteoglycans might enhance GAG&#8211;protein binding through multivalent interactions. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of dendritic GAG oligomers&#160;constructed of nona&#8208;sulfated hyaluronan tetrasaccharides&#160;for investigating the binding of the protein chemokine interleukin&#160;8 (IL&#8208;8) to artificial, well&#8208;defined proteoglycan architectures. Binding of mutant monomeric and native dimerizable IL&#8208;8 was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Dendritic oligomerization of GAG increased the binding affinity of both monomeric and dimeric IL&#8208;8. Monomeric IL&#8209;8 bound to monomeric and dimeric GAG with&#160;KD&#160;values of 7.3 &#181;M and 0.108 &#181;M, respectively. The effect was less pronounced for dimerizable wildtype IL&#8208;8, for which GAG dimerization improved the affinity from 34 nM to 5 nM. Binding of dimeric IL&#8208;8 to oligomeric GAG was limited by steric crowding effects, strongly reducing the affinity of subsequent binding events. In conclusion, the strongest effect of GAG oligomerization was the amplified binding of IL&#8208;8 monomers, which might concentrate monomeric protein in the extracellular matrix and thus promote protein dimerization under physiological conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Discrete Oligomers of Naphthalenediimides in Bulk and on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report on the synthesis of discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and study their molecular nanostructures both in bulk, in solution and at the solid&#8208;liquid interface. Via an iterative synthesis method, multiple NDI cores were bridged with short and saturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (C3 and C12) or long and unsaturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (u2C33 to u8C100) at their imide termini. The strong intermolecular interaction between the NDI cores was observed by probing their photophysical properties in solution. In bulk, the discrete NDI oligomers preferentially ordered in lamellar morphologies, irrespective of whether a saturated or unsaturated spacer was employed. Moreover, both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization conditions play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering. The long unsaturated alkyl chains lead preferably to folded&#8208;chain conformations while their saturated analogues form stretched arrangements. At the solution&#8208;solid interface, well&#8208;defined lamellar regions were observed. These results show that precision in chemical structure alone is not sufficient to reach well&#8208;defined structures of discrete oligomers, but that it must be combined with precision in processing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally diverse Pyrene&#8208;decorated planar chiral [2,2]paracyclophanes with tunable circularly polarized luminescence between monomer and excimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse CPL&#8208;active molecules, in which pyrene units were installed to chiral pm/po&#8208;[2.2]PCP scaffolds either with or without a triple bond spacer for pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral Rp&#8208;[2.2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments&#160;originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colors and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylenediimide through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to near&#8208;white fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea Promoted Neat Synthesis of Fused Dihydroisoquinolines and Disubstituted Pyridines: A Mechanistic Observation with Molecular Sensing Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and short synthesis of fused dihydroisoquinolines, diaryl substituted pyridine derivatives have been established in good to high yields using an environmentally safe, solvent&#8208;metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free tandem approach. In this article, we have discussed that the electrocyclic reaction is more pronounced in solid phase in presence of urea whereas the typical aza&#8208;Michael addition is more prominent in presence of arylamine in the solution phase for the substrate 3&#8208;(2&#8208;formylcycloalkenyl)&#8208;acrylic ester derivatives. The wide range of substrate variations and urea&#8208;promoted neat synthesis made our approach more significant in medical and also analytical science. Moreover, the isoquinoline alkaloid Decumbenine B analogue has been synthesized using our newly developed neat methodology. We have also investigated the photophysical properties of the synthesized fused dihydroisoquinoline derivatives. One of the synthesized molecules was used as a sensor for the selective detection of toxic picric acid. Therefore, the effective neat synthesis and molecular sensing applications of these compounds made our approach more exciting in the field of heterocyclic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of 3&#8209;Substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones via Non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an efficient method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of 2&#8208;benzofuranones with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is reported. The process is based on non&#8208;covalent interaction of NHC with substrate, facilitating the formation of a chiral ion&#8208;pair that encompasses enolate and azolium salt. The activated enolate adds to an electrophilic amine source with sufficient facial control to furnish an enantioenriched product having an amine substituted quaternary stereocenter. The process displays a broad substrate scope. A preparative scale synthesis has been achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations based on experimental and DFT studies suggest a reaction pathway that involves non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions and essentially implicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in diastereomeric transition states for stereo&#8208;chemical discrimination.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrated the first synthetic application of direct C&#8208;H olefinations in the step&#8208;saving preparation of various hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTM) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings of naphthodithiophene (NDT) with vinyl arenes under palladium&#8208;catalysis facilely generated various new oligo(hetero)aryls with internal alkenes. Reaction conditions were optimized, which gave the product isolated yields of up to 71% with high (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. These readily accessible NDT core&#8208;based small molecules involving olefin as &#960;&#8208;spacers displayed immediate power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.2% without a device oxidation process that is required for the commercially available spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and most other existing HTMs while fabricated in corresponding PSC devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Perchlorate Sensing Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of semiaza&#8208;Bambusurils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SAMs of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils equipped with thioethers or dithiolane functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes were characterized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy employing both negative and positively charged redox couples revealed that derivatives equipped with benzyl methyl thioether, especially the lipoic amide group, were suitable for anion sensing measurements and bound perchlorate preferentially over other anions.







Abstract
In the last two decades, perchlorate salts have been identified as environmental pollutants and recognized as potential substances affecting human health. We describe self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils (semiaza&#8208;BUs) equipped with thioethers or disulfide (dithiolane) functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722; as a redox probe, together with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry, were employed to characterize the interactions at the interface between the anchoring groups and the metal substrate. Data showed that the anion receptors&#8242; packing on the gold strongly depends on the anchoring group. As a result, SAMs of BUs with lipoic amide side chains show a concentration&#8208;dependent layer thickness. The BU SAMs are extremely stable on repeated electrochemical potential scans and can selectively recognize perchlorate anions. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that semiaza&#8208;BU equipped with the lipoic amide side chains binds perchlorate (2&#8211;100&#8197;mM) preferentially over other anions such as F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, I&#8722;, AcO&#8722;, H2PO4&#8722;, HPO42&#8722;, SO42&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, or CO32&#8722;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100&#8197;times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, or CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100&#8197;times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Benzene Triimide (BTI) Radical Anions for Probing the Interplay of Unpaired Electron Spin and Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel chiral Benzene triimide (BTI) radical anions are reported. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents is revealed by NIR circularly polarized light absorptions that arise from the unpaired electron spin transition. The modulation is attributed to chiral substitutes regulated transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron spin participated transition.







Abstract
Herein a series of chiral BTI radical anions bearing different chiral substituents were efficiently prepared by chemical reduction. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed finely&#8208;tuned packing and helix assemblies of the radicals by the size of chiral substituents in crystalline state. In accordance with the crystalline&#8208;state packing, the powder ESR spectra indicate that 4&#8201;a&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ and 4&#8201;c&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ &#960;&#8208;dimers exhibit thermally excited triplet states arising from strong spin&#8208;spin interactions, while discrete 4&#8201;b&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ shows a broad doublet&#8208;state signal reflecting weak spin&#8208;spin interactions. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents was studied by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and TD DFT calculations. Different NIR absorptions of the radicals attributing to isolated SOMO&#8594;LUMO+1 (~889&#8197;nm) transitions were recorded. The emergence of Cotton effects (CEs) at the NIR region for 4&#8201;c&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ radical enantiomers suggest the interplay between chirality and unpaired electron spin. The origin of the different circularly polarized light absorptions regarding SOMO derived transitions (around 880&#8197;nm) was attributed to chiral substitutes regulated electric and magnetic transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron participated transition.

         <title>Generation of Bioactivity&#8208;Tailored FK506/FK520 Analogs by CRISPR Editing in Streptomyces tsukubaensis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic engineering by targeted CRISPR editing was used to establish a sustainable production process for bioactivity&#8208;tailored FK506/FK520 analogues displaying FKBP12 binding while calcineurin inhibition was spared for a potential use in acute kidney injury (AKI).







Abstract
For a potential application of FK506 in the treatment of acute kidney failure only the FKBP12 binding capability of the compound is required, while the immunosuppressive activity via calcineurin binding is considered as a likely risk to the patients. The methoxy groups at C13 and C15 are thought to have significant influence on the immunosuppressive activity of the molecule. Consequently, FK506 analogs with different functionalities at C13 and C15 were generated by targeted CRISPR editing of the AT domains in module&#8197;7 and 8 of the biosynthetic assembly line in Streptomyces tsukubaensis. In addition, the corresponding FK520 (C21 ethyl derivative of FK506) analogs could be obtained by media adjustments. The compounds were tested for their bioactivity in regards to FKBP12 binding, BMP potentiation and calcineurin sparing. 15&#8208;desmethoxy FK506 was superior to the other tested analogs as it did not inhibit calcineurin but retained high potency towards FKBP12 binding and BMP potentiation.

         <title>A New Series of Sandwich&#8208;Type&#160;5,5'&#8208;Biterphenylenes:&#160;Synthetic Challenge, Structural Uniqueness and Photodynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A&#160;new series of biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes (BLTPs),&#160;were prepared using the&#160;tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization as&#160;the key synthetic step.&#160;The three&#8208;dimensional structures of the studied compounds were verified using X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Tetraaryl(ethynyl)&#8208;substituted&#160;BLTPs&#160;are highly&#160;crowded molecules, and the internal rotation around the central C&#8208;C bond is restricted due to a high barrier (&gt;50 kcal/mol). These structures containseveral&#160;aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches, where the&#160;through&#8208;space&#160;&#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;&#160;(TSPP) interactions&#160;are strongly reflected in the shielding of&#160;1H NMR chemical shifts, reduction of oxidation potentials, increasing aromaticity of the central six&#8208;membered ring and decreasing antiaromaticity of the four&#8208;membered rings in a terpheny&#8208;lenyl moiety&#160;based on&#160;NICS(0) and iso&#8208;chemical shielding surfaces.&#160;Despite the restricted C&#8208;C&#160;bond associated intramolecular TSPP&#160;interactions&#160;for BLTPs&#160;in the ground state, to our surprise, the electronic coupling between two linear terphenylenes&#160;(LTPs)&#160;in BLTPs in the excited state is weak, so that the excited&#8208;state behavior is dominated by the corresponding monomeric LTPs.

         <title>Extremely Slow Thermally&#8208;Induced Spin Crossover in the Two&#8208;Dimensional Network [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The changed phase&#8208;transition order causes an extremely slow spin transition in a 2D coordination polymer [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 regarded so far as a thermally&#8208;induced spin crossover inactive compound.







Abstract
Cooling [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) triggers very slow spin crossover below 80&#8197;K (T1/2&#8595;=76&#8197;K). The spin crossover (SCO) is accompanied by a hysteresis loop (T1/2&#8593;=89&#8197;K). In contrast to isostructural perchlorate analogue [Fe(bbtr)3](ClO4)2 in which spin crossover during cooling is preceded by phase transition at TPT=126&#8197;K in tetrafluoroborate phase transition does not occur to the beginning of spin crossover (80&#8197;K). Studies of mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.5&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) showed that a phase transition precedes spin crossover, however, for x&#8773;0.46 intersection of T1/2(x) and TPT(x) dependencies takes place. The application of pressure of 1&#8197;GPa shifts the spin crossover in [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 to a temperature above 270&#8197;K. High&#8208;pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295&#8197;K P1/2 value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P&#8208;3&#8594;P&#8208;1 phase transition occurs. In this report we have shown that 2D coordination polymer [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) treated to date as spin crossover silent shows thermally induced spin crossover phenomenon. Spin crossover in tetrafluoroborate is extremely slow. Determination of the spin crossover curve required carrying measurement in the settle mode&#8208;cooling from 85 to 70&#8197;K took about 600&#8197;h (average velocity of change of temperature ca. 0.0004&#8197;K/min).

The application of pressure of 1&#8197;GPa shifts the spin crossover in [Fe(bbtr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a temperature above 270&#8197;K. High-pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2(1-x)&lt;/sub&gt;(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2x&lt;/sub&gt; (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295&#8197;K P&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P-3&#8594;P-1 phase transition occurs. In this report we have shown that 2D coordination polymer [Fe(bbtr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (bbtr=1,4-di(1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)butane) treated to date as spin crossover silent shows thermally induced spin crossover phenomenon. Spin crossover in tetrafluoroborate is extremely slow. Determination of the spin crossover curve required carrying measurement in the settle mode-cooling from 85 to 70&#8197;K took about 600&#8197;h (average velocity of change of temperature &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 0.0004&#8197;K/min).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Ferroelectric [4&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexylamine]ClO4 Introduced by Boat and Chair Conformations of Cyclohexylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By choosing a polar and flexible organic cation trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine (4&#8208;MCHA+) to assemble with the inorganic perchloric acid, we obtained a new metal&#8208;free organic ferroelectric molecular material (4&#8208;MCHA)ClO4 (1). Remarkably, the ferroelectric phase transition (Pmn21&#8594;Pmmn) arises from the joint contribution of symmetry breaking and unusual anti&#8208;conformational reversal of organic cations.







Abstract
Organic ferroelectrics have received a great deal of interest due to their exclusive properties. However, organic ferroelectrics have not been fully explored, which hinders their practical application. Here, we presented a novel metal&#8208;free organic molecular ferroelectric [4&#8208;MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4&#8208;MCHA=trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature of 328&#8197;K. Strikingly, the single crystal structure analysis of 1 shows that the driving force of phase transition is related to the interesting chair&#8208;boat conformation change of 4&#8208;MCHA cation, in addition to the order&#8208;disorder transition of ClO4&#8722; anion. Using piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM), the presence of domains and the implemented polarization switching were clearly observed, which explicitly determined the presence of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of 1. As far as we know, the ferroelectric phase transition mechanism attributed to the conformational change in a trans isomeric cation is very rare. This research enriched the path of designing ferroelectric materials and smart materials.

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;Modulated Phase Regulation Based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of light responsive arylazopyrazole mesogens and their light&#8208;controlled liquid&#8208;crystalline phase regulation are reported. These compounds can act as a dopant in commercially available liquid crystals to provide fast and microscale optical responses at ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches. These compounds show liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior as shown by differential scanning calorimetry, grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and NMR analysis confirmed the excellent photophysical properties in solution and thin film. Additionally, polarized optical microscopy studies of the pristine compounds show reversible phase transition upon irradiation with light. Moreover, as a dopant in the commercially available liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB), the temperature range was reduced to ambient temperatures while preserving the photophysical properties. Remarkably, this co&#8208;assembled system shows reversible liquid&#8208;crystalline to isotropic phase transition upon irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The spatiotemporal control of the phase transition of the liquid crystals offers opportunities in the development of optical devices.

         <title>Defect engineering on electrocatalysts for sustainable nitrate reduction to ammonia: Fundamentals and regulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8208;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) is a &#8220;two birds&#8208;one stone&#8221; method that targets remediation of NO3&#8208;&#8208;containing sewage and production of valuable NH3. The exploitation of advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and durability is a key issue for the efficient catalytic performance. Among various strategies for catalyst design, defect engineering has gained increasing attention due to its ability to modulate the electronic properties of electrocatalysts and optimize the adsorption energy of reactive species, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Despite previous progress, there remains a lack of mechanistic insights into the regulation of catalyst defects for NO3&#8208; reduction. Herein, this review presents insightful understanding of defect engineering for NO3&#8208; reduction, covering its background, definition, classification, construction, and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the relationships between regulation of catalyst defects and their catalytic activities are illustrated by investigating the properties of electrocatalysts through the analysis of electronic band structure, charge density distribution, and controllable adsorption energy. Furthermore, challenges and perspectives for future development of defects in NO3RR are also discussed, which can help researchers to better understand the defect engineering in catalysts, and also inspire scientists entering into this promising field.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Magnetic Hardness by Modulating Antagonistic Interactions in the Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Free Magnetic Solid Solution Hf2Fe1&#8722; &#948; Ru5&#8722; x Ir x + &#948; B2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The quinary members in the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 (x = 1&#8208;4, VE = 63&#8208;66) have been investigated experimentally and computationally. They were synthesized via arc&#8208;melting and analyzed by EDX and&#160;X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations predicted a preference for magnetic ordering in all members, but with a strong competition between ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetism arising from interchain Fe&#8208;Fe interactions. The spin exchange and magnetic anisotropy energies predicted the lowest magnetic hardness for x = 1 and 3 and the highest for x = 2. Magnetization measurements confirm the DFT predictions and demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic ordering (TN = 55&#8208;70 K) found at low magnetic fields changed to ferromagnetic (TC = 150&#8208;750 K) at higher fields, suggesting metamagnetic behavior for all samples. As predicted, Hf2FeRu3Ir2B2 has the highest intrinsic coercivity (Hc = 74 kA/m) reported to date for Ti3Co5B2&#8208;type phases. Furthermore, all coercivities outperform that of ferromagnetic Hf2FeIr5B2, indicating the importance of AFM interactions in enhancing magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Importantly, two members (x = 1 and 4) maintain intrinsic coercivities in the semi&#8208;hard range at room temperature. This study opens an avenue for controlling magnetic hardness by modulating antagonistic AFM and FM interactions in low&#8208;dimensional rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Reinforcing the Adsorption and Conversion of Polysulfides in Li&#8208;S Battery by Incorporating Molybdenum into MnS/MnO Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Sabatier principle suggests that an excessive adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by metal compounds may hinder their conversion in the absence of a conversion module. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a synergetic effect mechanism between &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; for LiPSs. To achieve this coexistence, a molybdenum&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C porous structure is designed as a multifunctional coating on the polypropylene (PP) separator. The incorporation of MnS/MnO@C enhances the adsorption capacity towards LiPSs, while molybdenum facilitates subsequent conversions. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of each component and its large specific surface area, the cell with Mo&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C coating achieves smooth adsorption&#8208;diffusion&#8208;conversion processes and exhibits an appreciable rate performance with outstanding cycling stability. Even when sulfur loading increasing to 9.68 mg cm&#8208;2, the modified battery delivers an excellent initial areal capacity of 11.69 mAh cm&#8208;2 and maintains 6.97 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 50 cycles at 0.1 C.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Sabatier principle suggests that an excessive adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by metal compounds may hinder their conversion in the absence of a conversion module. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a synergetic effect mechanism between &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; for LiPSs. To achieve this coexistence, a molybdenum-doped MnS/MnO@C porous structure is designed as a multifunctional coating on the polypropylene (PP) separator. The incorporation of MnS/MnO@C enhances the adsorption capacity towards LiPSs, while molybdenum facilitates subsequent conversions. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of each component and its large specific surface area, the cell with Mo-doped MnS/MnO@C coating achieves smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion processes and exhibits an appreciable rate performance with outstanding cycling stability. Even when sulfur loading increasing to 9.68 mg cm-2, the modified battery delivers an excellent initial areal capacity of 11.69 mAh cm-2 and maintains 6.97 mAh cm-2 after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. This study presents a promising approach to simultaneously accomplish &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; of polysulfides, offering neoteric views for devising dual-functional modified separators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen substitution regulates high temperature dielectric switch in lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) based phase transition materials have received widespread attention due to their excellent performance and potential applications in energy harvesting, optoelectronics, ferroics, and actuators. Nevertheless, effectively regulating the properties of phase transitions is still a thorny problem. In this work, we synthesized two chiral lead&#8208;free HMHs (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP = 3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2). By replacing the halide ions in the inorganic skeleton, the phase transition temperature of 2 changes with an increase of about 20 K, compared with 1. Meanwhile, both compounds display reversible dielectric switching properties. Through crystal structure analysis and Hirshfeld surface analysis, their phase transitions are ascribed to the disorder of the cations and deformation of the inorganic chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Luminescent Mononuclear Three&#8208;Coordinate CuI Complexes by Two Distinct Cavity&#8208;Shaped Diphosphanes Obtained from a Single &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Precursor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Slightly different reaction conditions afforded two distinct cavity&#8208;shaped cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes from the same starting materials, namely diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. Thanks to their metal confining properties, the two diphosphanes form only mononuclear [CuX(PP)] complexes (X = Cl, Br, or I) with the tricoordinated metal ion located just above the center of the cavity. The two series of CuI complexes display markedly different luminescence properties that are both influenced by the electronic properties of the ligand and the unique steric environment provided by the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity. The excited state lifetimes of all complexes are significantly longer than those of cavity&#8208;free analogues suggesting peculiar electronic effects that affect radiative deactivation constants. The overall picture stemming from absorption and emission data suggests close lying charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT, XLCT) and triplet ligand&#8208;centered (LC) excited states.</dc:description>

Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Silylated Vinylboronates by a Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction and Their Application to Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly stereoselective synthesis of a series of tetrasubstituted mono&#8208; as well as disilylated vinylboronates were reported using the boron&#8208;Wittig approach. The condensation between acylsilanes and gem&#8208;diborylalkanes gave the desired tetrasubstituted olefins in good to excellent yield and high stereoselectivity. Also, a series of trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA&#8208;boronates were synthesized using the boron&#8208;Wittig followed by a transesterification reaction. This methodology allows direct incorporation of B(pin) and TMS group in the anti&#8208;position of the olefin in a highly stereoselective manner. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling reaction with the silylated vinyl boronic esters generated all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, which have been applied in the total synthesis of the anticancer drug Tamoxifen and aggregation&#8208;induced luminogen agent TPE&#8208;TF17.</dc:description>

         <title>Gd3TeBO9: A Rare&#8208;Earth Borate with Significant Magnetocaloric Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gadolinium&#8208;based oxide Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd content and excellent magnetocaloric effect is described.







Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology based on Gd&#8208;based paramagnets is expected to be applied to refrigeration in extremely low temperatures, thereby reducing the consumption of liquid helium. Here, we obtained a compound, Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd3+ concentration through element substitution. The Gd3+ concentration in this compound is as high as 2.4&#215;1024&#8197;ions/kg, which is 33&#8201;% higher than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), and further magnetic tests show that Gd3TeBO9 has a large magnetic entropy change (57.44&#8197;J/(kg&#8201;K) and 408&#8197;mJ/(cm3&#8201;K) at 2.6&#8197;K and 7&#8197;T), which is 1.5&#8197;times that of GGG, implying the possibility of its further development as an potential magnetocaloric material.

         <title>Hauser&#8208;Kraus Annulation Initiated Multi&#8208;Cascade Reactions for Facile Access to Functionalized and Fused Oxazepines, Carbazoles and Phenanthridinediones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing on track. Several nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles such as dihydrobenzo[d]naphthooxazepine, benzo[a]carbazole and benzo[j]phenanthridine&#8208;7,12&#8208;dione are accessible by a base mediated reaction of 3&#8208;olefinic oxindole with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalide. This cascade synthesis involved several regioselective steps such as Hauser&#8208;Kraus annulation, ring cleavage (C&#8722;C&#963;), ring expansion, ring opening and ring contraction reactions in one pot. The formation of a new compound at every stage of the reaction by forming multiple new chemical bonds while proceeding to the title compound is another highlight of this reaction sequence. Further, the transformation generates stable and isolable medium rings.

The Hauser&#8208;Kraus (H&#8722;K) annulation of N&#8208;unsubstituted 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalides triggers a cascade of ring expansion and ring contraction reactions through several regioselective steps in one pot. While oxazepines were isolated in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of base at room temperature, carbazoles and phenanthridinediones were the products in the presence of excess base and microwave irradiation. Mechanistic studies guided by stepwise reactions and control experiments revealed that the isolable oxazepine intermediate, formed via ring expansion of the H&#8722;K adduct, is the key precursor to carbazole and phenanthridinedione via decarboxylative regioselective cyclizations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advancing on track&lt;/b&gt;. Several nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles such as dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]naphthooxazepine, benzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]carbazole and benzo[&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;]phenanthridine-7,12-dione are accessible by a base mediated reaction of 3-olefinic oxindole with 3-nucleophilic phthalide. This cascade synthesis involved several regioselective steps such as Hauser-Kraus annulation, ring cleavage (C&#8722;C&#963;), ring expansion, ring opening and ring contraction reactions in one pot. The formation of a new compound at every stage of the reaction by forming multiple new chemical bonds while proceeding to the title compound is another highlight of this reaction sequence. Further, the transformation generates stable and isolable medium rings. The complete mechanism of the reaction was rationalized by isolating and converting all stable intermediates to target compounds and by control experiments.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols via Substrate Control on Asymmetric Lithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sparteine free Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement was applied to various chiral acetonides. Utilizing different vinyl boronic esters a high level of substrate control was observed leading to excellent selectivities. These selectivities were attributed to stereoelectronic effects of the neighboring acetonide moiety. The obtained formal Felkin and anti&#8208;Felkin products feature up to four contiguous stereocenters representing structural motifs common in natural products.







Abstract
Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic C2H2 Semihydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an ultrathin MOF sheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) catalyst for selectively semihydrogenation of C2H2 into C2H4. Under C2H2 atmosphere, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic C2H2 hydrogenation in aqueous solution was achieved with TONC2H4 of 2124 and 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4. Even under competitive conditions (1.10&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H4 in C2H2), Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs can reduce the concentration of C2H2 to 5&#8197;ppm with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, proved its potential for application in polymer&#8208;grade ethylene production.







Abstract
The selective semihydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in crude C2H4 (with ~1&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H2 contamination) is a crucial process in the manufacture of polyethylene. Comparing to conventional thermalcatalytic route with Pd as catalyst under high temperature with H2 as hydrogen source, photocatalytic C2H2 reduction reaction with H2O as hydrogen source can achieve high selectivity under milder conditions, but has rarely been reported. Here, we present a kind of ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) that demonstrate excellent catalytic activities in the semihydrogenation of C2H2. Employing Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, this catalyst attains a noteworthy turnover number (TON) of 2124 for C2H4, coupled with an impressive selectivity of 99.5&#8201;% after 12&#8197;h visible light irradiation. This performance is comparable to molecular catalysts and notably surpasses the efficiency of bulk metal&#8211;organic framework materials. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs achieve a 99.95&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 under industrial relevant conditions (1.10&#8201;% C2H2 in C2H4) with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, demonstrating a great potential for polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 production.

Pentafulvene&#8208;containing dyes: The cyclic cross&#8208;conjugated disposition of pentafulvenes creates a distinctive electron system, making them an exciting class of organic compounds. They attracted significant attention because of their propensity to display non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic properties. Synthesis of a series of such pentafulvene&#8208;containing compounds was easily achieved by the reaction of spiro[4.4]nonane in an acidic medium under metal&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the synthesis of various functionalized spiro[4.4]nonanes was achieved by the reaction of dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) with 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208; indandiones in the presence of a catalytic amount of 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organo&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Synergistic topological and supramolecular control of Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity based on a tunable self&#8208;complexing hos&#8208;guest molecular switch</title>

         <dc:description>Compartmentalization and binding&#8208;triggered conformational change regulate many metabolic processes in living matter. Here, we have synergistically combined these two biorelevant processes to tune the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactivity of a synthetic self&#8208;complexing host&#8208;guest molecular switch CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu, consisting of an electron&#8208;rich furan unit covalently attached to the electron&#8208;deficient cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetrachloride (CBPQT4+, 4Cl&#8208;) host. This design allows CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu to efficiently compartmentalize the furan ring inside its host cavity in water, thereby protecting it from the DA reaction with maleimide. Remarkably, the self&#8208;complexed CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu can undergo a conformational change through intramolecular decomplexation upon the addition of a stronger binding molecular naphthalene derivative as a competitive guest, triggering the DA reaction upon addition of a chemical regulator. Remarkably, connecting the guest onto a thermoresponsive lower critical solution temperature (LCST) copolymer regulator controls the DA reaction on command upon heating and cooling the reaction media beyond and below the cloud point temperature of the copolymer, representing a rare example of decreased reactivity upon increasing temperature. Altogether, this work opens up new avenues towards combined topological and supramolecular control over reactivity in synthetic constructs enabling control over reactivity through molecular regulators or even mild temperature variations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developed here is a robust electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine via concomitant cleavage and formation of C(sp2)&#8208;N bond with the evolution of H2 and N2 as innocuous by&#8208;products. This sustainable protocol avoids the use of toxic reagents and occurs at room temperature. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an aroyl and a sulfoximidoyl radical via anodic oxidation under constant current electrolysis (CCE), affording N&#8208;aroylated sulfoximine. The strategy is applied to late&#8208;stage sulfoximidation of L&#8208;menthol, (&#8208;)&#8208;borneol, D&#8208;glucose, vitamin&#8208;E derivatives, and marketed drugs such as probenecid, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ciprofibrate, and sulindac.

         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyzes the hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates. DFT calculations support a mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Amphoteric Reactivity of an Iron&#8208;Bispidine Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient iron(III)&#8208;superoxido species in disguise orchestrates the reactivity of an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxido complex stabilized in an engineered bispidine scaffold.







Abstract
The reactivity of FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complexes has remained a riddle to inorganic chemists owing to their thermal instability and impotency towards organic substrates. These iron&#8208;oxygen adducts have been known as sluggish oxidants towards oxidative electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a relatively stable mononuclear high&#8208;spin FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex supported by an engineered bispidine framework. Against the notion, this FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex serves as a rare example of versatile reactivity in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies and computational calculations reveal a novel reaction mechanism, where a putative superoxido intermediate orchestrates the amphoteric property of the oxidant. The design of the backbone is pivotal to convey stability and reactivity to alkylperoxido and superoxido intermediates. Contrary to the well&#8208;known O&#8722;O bond cleavage that generates an FeIV&#8208;oxido species, the FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex reported here undergoes O&#8722;C bond scission to generate a superoxido moiety that is responsible for the amphiphilic reactivity.
