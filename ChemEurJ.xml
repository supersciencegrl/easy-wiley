         <title>Ox&#8208;SLIM: Synthesis of and Site&#8208;Specific Labelling with a Highly Hydrophilic Trityl Spin Label</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxylated trityl spin label for proteins, called OxSLIM was synthesized. Given its high hydrophilicity, outstanding bioresistance, and short linkage, it combines the most recent advances in just a single molecule. Moreover, its improved relaxation behaviour allows for highly sensitive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)&#8208;based distance measurements down to concentrations as low as 45&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The combination of pulsed dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (PDS) with site&#8208;directed spin labelling is a powerful tool in structural biology. Rational design of trityl&#8208;based spin labels has enabled studying biomolecular structures at room temperature and within cells. However, most current trityl spin labels suffer either from aggregation with proteins due to their hydrophobicity, or from bioconjugation groups not suitable for in&#8208;cell measurements. Therefore, we introduce here the highly hydrophilic trityl spin label Ox&#8208;SLIM. Engineered as a short&#8208;linked maleimide, it combines the most recent developments in one single molecule, as it does not aggregate with proteins, exhibits high resistance under in&#8208;cell conditions, provides a short linker, and allows for selective and efficient spin labelling via cysteines. Beyond establishing synthetic access to Ox&#8208;SLIM, its suitability as a spin label is illustrated and ultimately, highly sensitive PDS measurements are presented down to protein concentrations as low as 45&#8197;nm resolving interspin distances of up to 5.5&#8197;nm.

         <title>Hierarchical Spin&#8208;Crossover Cooperativity in Hybrid 1D Chains of FeII&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Trimers Linked by [Au(CN)2]&#8722; Bridges</title>

Hierarchical cooperativity: Crucial information on the nature, magnitude, and dimensional hierarchy of elastic coupling in spin&#8208;crossover systems is achieved in a family of materials consisting of trimers linked into coordination chains and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests.







Abstract
Foremost, practical applications of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) materials require control of the nature of the spin&#8208;state coupling. In existing SCO materials, there is a single, well&#8208;defined dimensionality relevant to the switching behavior. A new material, consisting of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;based trimers coordinated into 1D chains by [Au(CN)2]&#8722; and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests, underwent SCO defined by elastic coupling across multiple dimensional hierarchies. Detailed structural, vibrational, and theoretical studies conclusively confirmed that intra&#8208;trimer coupling was an order of magnitude greater than the intramolecular coupling, which was an order of magnitude greater than intermolecular coupling. As such, a clear hierarchy on the nature of elastic coupling in SCO materials was ascertained for the first time, which is a necessary step for the technological development of molecular switching materials.

         <title>Diazapentacenes from Quinacridones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piecing together a diazaacene: Starting from linear cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;quinacridones, the synthesis, characteristics and stability of four diazapentacenes are reported leading to a design rule for 12,14&#8208;alkynylated heteroacenes for organic electronics (see figure).







Abstract
Bis(silylethynylated) 5,7&#8208; and 5,12&#8208;diazapentacenes were synthesized from cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;quinacridone using protection, alkynylation and deoxygenation. The solid&#8208;state packing of the targets is determined by choice and position of the silylethynyl substituents. The position of the substituents and nitrogen atoms influence the optical properties of the targets.

         <title>HNO to NO Conversion Mechanism with Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase, Comparison with Heme Protein Mediated Conversions, and the Origin of Questionable Reversibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Similarities and differences: This reaction is important for NO formation and HNO detection. Calculations provide the first theoretical mechanistic information on the nonheme protein mediated process and many previously unknown mechanistic similarities and differences compared with those of conversions mediated by heme proteins. Importantly, the first kinetically feasible and thermodynamically favorable mechanism is shown.







Abstract
The interconversion of NO and HNO, via copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), is important in biomedicine and for HNO detection. Many mechanistic questions, including the decades&#8208;long debate on reversibility, were resolved in this work. Calculations of various active&#8208;site and full&#8208;protein models show that the basic mechanism is proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with a computed barrier of 10.98&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which is in excellent agreement with experimental results (10.62&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and this nonheme protein&#8208;mediated reaction has many significant mechanistic differences compared with the conversions mediated by heme proteins due to geometric and electronic factors. The reasons for the irreversible nature of this conversion and models with the first thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible mechanism for the experimental reverse reaction were discovered. Such results are the first for nonheme enzyme mediated HNO to NO conversions, which shall facilitate other related studies and HNO probe development.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Functionalized Core&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Micelles and Nanogels with a Polycationic Outer Shell: Synthesis and Application in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Biphasic Hydrogenations</title>

Pretty polly: Stable latexes of size&#8208;controlled spherical and unimolecular polymers, made of a cross&#8208;linked and phosphine&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic core and a poly(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinylpyridinium) shell, are efficient nanoreactors for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation under aqueous biphasic conditions with excellent recyclability and negligible levels of leaching.







Abstract
Unimolecular amphiphilic nanoreactors with a poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide) (P4VPMe+I&#8722;) polycationic outer shell and two different architectures (core&#8208;cross&#8208;linked micelles, CCM, and nanogels, NG), with narrow size distributions around 130&#8211;150&#8197;nm in diameter, were synthesized by RAFT polymerization from an R0&#8208;4VPMe+I&#8722;140&#8208;b&#8208;S50&#8208;SC(S)SPr macroRAFT agent by either chain extension with a long (300 monomer units) hydrophobic polystyrene&#8208;based block followed by cross&#8208;linking with diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA) for the CCM particles, or by simultaneous chain extension and cross&#8208;linking for the NG particles. A core&#8208;anchored triphenylphosphine (TPP) ligand functionality was introduced by using 4&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene (DPPS) as a comonomer (5&#8211;20&#8201;%&#8201;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) in the chain extension (for CCM) or chain extension/cross&#8208;linking (for NG) step. The products were directly obtained as stable colloidal dispersions in water (latexes). After loading with [RhCl(COD)]2 to yield [RhCl(COD)(TPP@CCM)] or [RhCl(COD)(TPP@NG)], respectively, the polymers were used as polymeric nanoreactors in Rh&#8208;catalyzed aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of the model substrates styrene and 1&#8208;octene, either neat (for styrene) or in an organic solvent (toluene or 1&#8208;nonanol). All hydrogenations were rapid (TOF up to 300&#8197;h&#8722;1) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 20&#8197;bar of H2 pressure, the biphasic mixture rapidly decanted at the end of the reaction (&lt;2&#8197;min), the Rh loss was negligible (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm in the recovered organic phase), and the catalyst phase could be recycled 10 times without significant loss of catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;Unimolecular amphiphilic nanoreactors with a poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide) (P4VPMe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) polycationic outer shell and two different architectures (core&#8208;cross&#8208;linked micelles, CCM, and nanogels, NG), with narrow size distributions around 130&#8211;150&#8197;nm in diameter, were synthesized by RAFT polymerization from an R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;4VPMe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;140&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;S&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;SC(S)SPr macroRAFT agent by either chain extension with a long (300 monomer units) hydrophobic polystyrene&#8208;based block followed by cross&#8208;linking with diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA) for the CCM particles, or by simultaneous chain extension and cross&#8208;linking for the NG particles. A core&#8208;anchored triphenylphosphine (TPP) ligand functionality was introduced by using 4&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene (DPPS) as a comonomer (5&#8211;20&#8201;%&#8201;mol&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in the chain extension (for CCM) or chain extension/cross&#8208;linking (for NG) step. The products were directly obtained as stable colloidal dispersions in water (latexes). After loading with [RhCl(COD)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to yield [RhCl(COD)(TPP@CCM)] or [RhCl(COD)(TPP@NG)], respectively, the polymers were used as polymeric nanoreactors in Rh&#8208;catalyzed aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of the model substrates styrene and 1&#8208;octene, either neat (for styrene) or in an organic solvent (toluene or 1&#8208;nonanol). All hydrogenations were rapid (TOF up to 300&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 20&#8197;bar of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure, the biphasic mixture rapidly decanted at the end of the reaction (&amp;lt;2&#8197;min), the Rh loss was negligible (&amp;lt;0.1&#8197;ppm in the recovered organic phase), and the catalyst phase could be recycled 10 times without significant loss of catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reductive Coupling of (Fluoro)pyridines by Linear 3d&#8208;Metal(I) Silylamides of Cr&#8211;Co: A Tale of C&#8722;C Bond Formation, C&#8722;F Bond Cleavage and a Pyridyl Radical Anion</title>

Now that's radical! The reactions of linear metal(I) complexes (M=Cr&#8211;Fe) with simple pyridines leads to the reductive coupling of the substrates through intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation, which can be reversible, as shown for iron. For fluoropyridines, C&#8722;F bond cleavage is preferred, leading to rare low&#8208;coordinate metal(II) fluorides (see scheme). The structure of a rare 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;free pyridyl radical anion is also presented.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the facile reduction of pyridine (and its derivatives) by linear 3d&#8208;metal(I) silylamides (M=Cr&#8211;Co). This reaction resulted in intermolecular C&#8722;C coupling to give dinuclear metal(II) complexes bearing a bridging 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydrobipyridyl ligand. For iron, we demonstrated that the C&#8722;C coupling is reversible in solution, either directly or by reaction with substrates, via a presumed monomeric metal(II) complex bearing a pyridyl radical anion. In the course of this investigation, we also observed that the dinuclear metal(II) complex incorporating iron facilitated the isomerisation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene as well as equimolar amounts of benzene and cyclohexene. Furthermore, we synthesised and structurally characterised a non&#8208;3d&#8208;metal&#8208;bound pyridyl radical anion. The reactions of the silylamides with perfluoropyridine led to C&#8722;F bond cleavage with the formation of metal(II) fluoride complexes of manganese, iron and cobalt along with the homocoupling or reductive degradation of the substrate. In the case of cobalt, the use of lesser fluorinated pyridines led to C&#8722;F bond cleavage but no homocoupling. Overall, in this paper we provide insights into the multifaceted behaviour of simple (fluoro)pyridines in the presence of moderately to highly reducing metal complexes.

Trapped in ice: A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight MS study provides evidence of the generation of three previously elusive organosilicon molecules in silane&#8211;CO2 ices exposed to energetic electrons. The molecules were also identified through their isotope shifts in deuterated and 18O&#8208;substituted samples. PI&#8208;ReTOF&#8208;MS should help identify further complex silicon molecules that cannot be identified by traditional methods.







Abstract
The identification of silicon&#8208;substituted, complex organics carrying multiple functional groups by classical infrared spectroscopy is challenging because the group frequencies of functional groups often overlap. Photoionization (PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;fight mass spectrometry (ReTOF&#8208;MS) in combination with temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) holds certain advantages because molecules are identified after sublimation from the matrix into in the gas phase based on distinct ionization energies and sublimation temperatures. In this study, we reveal the detection of 1&#8208;silaglycolaldehyde (HSiOCH2OH), 2&#8208;sila&#8208;acetic acid (H3SiCOOH), and 1,2&#8208;disila&#8208;acetaldehyde (H3SiSiHO)&#8212;the silicon analogues of the well&#8208;known glycolaldehyde (HCOCH2OH), acetic acid (H3CCOOH), and acetaldehyde (H3CCHO), in the gas phase after preparation in silane (SiH4)&#8211;carbon dioxide ices exposed to energetic electrons and subliming the neutral reaction products formed within the ices into the gas phase.

         <title>Applications of Low&#8208;Melting&#8208;Point Metals in Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>

Low&#8208;melting&#8208;point metals: Alloying chemistry affords high Li/Na/K content per formula and therefore high capacities. In particular, metals with low melting points (LMP) are thermodynamically preferable for the electrochemical alloying process, some of which also exhibit high flexibility, ductility, or even fluidity, which facilitates electrode fabrication. This minireview summarizes the recent progress of typical LMP metals such as In, Ga, and Hg in rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Low&#8208;melting&#8208;point (LMP) metals represent an interesting family of electrode materials owing to their high ionic conductivity, good ductility or fluidity, low hardness and/or superior alloying capability, all of which are crucial characteristics to address battery challenges such as interfacial incompatibility, electrode pulverization, and dendrite growth. This minireview summarizes recent research progress of typical LMP metals including In, Ga, Hg, and their alloys in rechargeable metal batteries. Emphasis is placed on mainstream electrochemical storage devices of Li, Na, and K batteries as well as the representative multi&#8208;valent metal batteries. The fundamental correlations between unique physiochemical properties of LMP metals and the battery performance are highlighted. In addition, this article also provides insights into future development and potential directions of LMP metals/alloys for practical applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Photophysical Properties of a New Class of Inherently Chiral Boron(III) Chelates&#8212;The tert&#8208;Leucine Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral boron(III) chelates form under mild conditions from tert&#8208;leucine derivatives without needing resolution of diastereoisomers. These weakly fluorescent complexes possess two chiral centres, namely the B(III) atom and the C atom imported with the leucine fragment, and full stereochemical assignment is made by CD spectroscopy. X&#8208;ray structures show a distorted geometry at the B(III) site, with the crystal exhibiting amplified emission.







Abstract
A new family of boron(III) chelates is introduced whereby molecular chirality, confirmed by circular dichroism, is imported during synthesis such that isolation of the diastereoisomers does not require separation procedures. The photophysical properties of two members of the family have been examined: the N,O,O&#8208;salicylaldehyde&#8208;based derivative shows pronounced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer character in fluid solution and is weakly fluorescent, with a large Stokes shift. The corresponding 2&#8208;methylamino&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8208;derived N,N,O&#8208;chelate absorbs and fluoresces in the visible region with a much smaller Stokes shift. Orange fluorescence is also observed for this compound as a cast film. Temperature&#8208;dependence studies show that decay of the fluorescent state is weakly activated but emission is less than quantitative at 77&#8197;K. Quite rare for boron(III)&#8208;based chelates, this derivative undergoes intersystem crossing to form a meta&#8208;stable triplet&#8208;excited state. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are reported for both compounds, along with simulated ECD spectra.

         <title>Merging Pd0/PdII Redox and PdII/PdII Non&#8208;redox Catalytic Cycles for the Allylarylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative catalysis based on merging Pd0/PdII redox and PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox catalytic cycles enables an allylarylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes with aryl boronates and allylic carbonates to allow access to a wide variety of carbon skeletons.







Abstract
An allylarylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes with aryl boronates and allylic carbonates has been developed. This method allows access to a wide variety of carbon skeletons from readily available starting materials. Mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is enabled by a cooperative catalysis based on merging Pd0/PdII redox and PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox catalytic cycles.

Containers of chemical species: The painting illustrates a bottle and a vase containing chemical species. In a bottle, like in the case of SAPO&#8208;18 and similar structures, the species that are larger than the bottleneck cannot exit and remain trapped inside (ship in a bottle). Contrariwise, in a vase with no bottleneck, like in the case of ZSM&#8208;5 and similar structures, these species can exit and few remain trapped.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Postfunctionalization of Dye Layers on TiO2 &#8212; A Tool for Enhancing Injection in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered approach to capture the sun: We present a sequential covalent/non&#8208;covalent functionalization pathway for metal oxide nanoparticles. Initially a first ligand layer is attached via covalent anchoring of carboxylates, followed by a highly versatile addition of a second dye layer via hydrogen bonding. The resulting hierarchical hybrid architectures were investigated regarding their photophysical properties and finally implemented in sandwich&#8208;type dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) configurations, resulting in an efficiency increase of up to 43&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report on newly tailored dye layers, which were employed, on one hand, for covalent deposition and, on the other hand, for non&#8208;covalently post&#8208;functionalizing TiO2 nanoparticle films. Our functionalization concept enabled intermixing a stable covalent attachment of a first layer with a highly versatile and reversible hydrogen bonding through the Hamilton receptor&#8211;cyanuric acid binding motif as a second layer. Following this concept, we integrated step&#8208;by&#8208;step a first porphyrin layer and a second porphyrin/BODIPY layer. The individual building blocks and their corresponding combinations were probed with regard to their photophysical properties, and the most promising combinations were implemented in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Relative to the first porphyrin layer adding the second porphyrin/BODIPY layers increased the overall DSSC efficiency by up to 43&#8201;%.

         <title>Spin State Tunes Oxygen Atom Transfer towards FeIVO Formation in FeII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin control: The formation of oxoiron(IV) complexes by the reaction of iron(II) precursors bearing tetradentate N ligands with IO4&#8722; occurs through a fast spin&#8208;crossover pre&#8208;equilibrium followed by rate&#8208;determining substitution to form an intermediate that leads rapidly to the FeIV=O species. The experimental kinetic and activation parameters highlight a key role played the spin in controlling the reaction.







Abstract
Oxoiron(IV) complexes bearing tetradentate ligands have been extensively studied as models for the active oxidants in non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzymes. These species are commonly generated by oxidation of their ferrous precursors. The mechanisms of these reactions have seldom been investigated. In this work, the reaction kinetics of complexes [FeII(CH3CN)2L](SbF6)2 ([1](SbF6)2 and [2](SbF6)2) and [FeII(CF3SO3)2L] ([1](OTf)2 and [2](OTf)2 (1, L=Me,HPytacn; 2, L=nP,HPytacn; R,R&#8242;Pytacn=1&#8208;[(6&#8208;R&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]&#8208;4,7&#8208; di&#8208;R&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane) with Bu4NIO4 to form the corresponding [FeIV(O)(CH3CN)L]2+ (3, L=Me,HPytacn; 4, L=nP,HPytacn) species was studied in acetonitrile/acetone at low temperatures. The reactions occur in a single kinetic step with activation parameters independent of the nature of the anion and similar to those obtained for the substitution reaction with Cl&#8722; as entering ligand, which indicates that formation of [FeIV(O)(CH3CN)L]2+ is kinetically controlled by substitution in the starting complex to form [FeII(IO4)(CH3CN)L]+ intermediates that are converted rapidly to oxo complexes 3 and 4. The kinetics of the reaction is strongly dependent on the spin state of the starting complex. A detailed analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and kinetic data for the triflate complexes reveals that the experimental values of the activation parameters for both complexes are the result of partial compensation of the contributions from the thermodynamic parameters for the spin&#8208;crossover equilibrium and the activation parameters for substitution. The observation of these opposite and compensating effects by modifying the steric hindrance at the ligand illustrates so far unconsidered factors governing the mechanism of oxygen atom transfer leading to high&#8208;valent iron oxo species.

         <title>Modulating Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Interfaces on Nickel&#8211;Copper Double Hydroxide Nanotyres to Pre&#8208;activate Alkaline Ammonia Oxidation Reactivity</title>

The more the merrier: Hierarchical porous NiCu double hydroxide nanotyres (NiCu DHTs) with hydroxyl&#8208;rich interfaces are designed to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency, exhibiting excellent activity, stability, and sensitivity for the ammonia oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The surface hydroxyl groups of NixCu1&#8722;x(OH)2 play a crucial role in governing their conversion efficiency into NixCu1&#8722;xOx(OH)2&#8722;x during the electro&#8208;chemical pre&#8208;activation process, thus affecting the integral ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reactivity. Herein, the rational design of hierarchical porous NiCu double hydroxide nanotyres (NiCu DHTs) was reported for the first time by considering hydroxyl&#8208;rich interfaces to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency and intrinsic structural superiority (i.e., annulus, porosity) to accelerate AOR kinetics. A systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;function relationship was conducted by manipulating a series of NiCu DHs with tunable intercalations and morphologies. Remarkably, the NiCu DHTs exhibit superior AOR activity (onset potential of 1.31&#8197;V with 7.52&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#8197;V) and high ammonia sensitivity (detection limit of 9&#8197;&#956;m), manifesting one of the best non&#8208;noble metal AOR electrocatalysts and electro&#8208;analytical electrodetectors. This work deepens the understanding of the crucial role of surface hydroxyl groups on determining the catalytic performance in alkaline medium.

         <title>Metal Sulfide Nanoparticles: Precursor Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation on large scales: Precursor&#8211;solvent combinations used to produce metal sulfide nanoparticles through multiple pathways are discussed herein. The production of metal sulfide nanoparticles, which are valuable in a plethora of applications, is discussed and it is highlighted how the establishment of new methods will help to standardize and increase production capabilities.







Abstract
Fascination with and the need for evermore increasing efficiency, power, or strength have been the cornerstones for developing new materials and methods for their creation. Higher solar cell conversion efficiencies, increased battery storage power, and lightweight strong materials are some that have been at the forefront of attention for these efforts. Materials created for most applications start as simple chemical compounds. A study of how these chemicals have been used in the past can be used to create new materials and new methods of production. Herein, a class of materials that are valuable in a multitude of applications, metal sulfide nanoparticles, are examined, along with how they are being produced and how new methods can be established that will help to standardize and increase production capabilities. Precursor&#8211;solvent combinations that can be used to create metal sulfide nanoparticles in the gas phase are also explored.

Nickela&#8208;electrothiolation: A nascent co&#8208;operation between nickel catalysis and electrochemical synthesis to bring forth cross&#8208;electrophile thiolation of alkyl bromides.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing molecules are of utmost topical importance towards the effective development of pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we present an efficient and mild electrochemical thiolation by cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of alkyl bromides with functionalized bench&#8208;stable thiosulfonates to access alkyl sulfides with excellent efficacy and broad functional group tolerance. Cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic analysis were performed to elucidate mechanistic insights into this electrocatalytic thiolation reaction.

         <title>Mediated Generation of Conjugate Acid by UV and Blue Sensitizers with Upconversion Nanoparticles at 980&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make it acidic with long wavelength invisible light: Upconversion nanoparticles generate blue and UV light needed to excite a sensitizer absorbing in the UV or blue whose reaction with an onium salt results in conjugate acid. Rhodamine B lactone helps to quantify it and gives a drawback for initiation of cationic polymerization. Different efficiencies were found appearing in distinct deep red color.







Abstract
NIR and UV exposure of systems comprising upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) based on NaYF4:Tm/Yb@NaYF4, a sensitizer absorbing either in the blue or UV region, and an onium salt with weak coordinating anion resulted in formation of conjugate acid (con&#8208;H+). That was namely Ivocerin (di(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)diethylgermane), ITX (2&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl thioxanthone), anthracene, pyrene, rubrene, camphore quinone, and a strong fluorescent coumarin (1,1,6,6,8&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahyhdro&#8208;1H,4H&#8208;11&#8208;oxa&#8208;3a&#8208;aza&#8208;benzo[de]anthracene&#8208;10&#8208;one). Quantification occurred by treatment with Rhodamine B lactone whose color switched to intensive red after photolytic formation of con&#8208;H+. Exposure with a NIR laser at 980&#8197;nm resulted in less con&#8208;H+ compared to 395&#8197;nm where all sensitizers absorb radiation. UCNP did not mainly interfered formation of con&#8208;H+. The different rates obtained in both experiments responsibly explain the failure and success to initiate polymerization of epoxides applying ether 980&#8197;nm or 395&#8197;nm excitation, respectively.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Diene with Amine and Disilane under a Mild Re&#8208;oxidation System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a one&#8208;step Pd&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes with amine and disilane to form C&#8722;N and C&#8722;Si bonds under base, acid, and ligand&#8208;free conditions using molecular oxygen as terminal re&#8208;oxidant. This reaction provided allylic silane including allylic amine framework along with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity via oxidative amination mechanism.







Abstract
A highly regioselective and stereoselective difunctionalization reaction of 1,3&#8208;diene with amine and disilane to form C&#8722;N and C&#8722;Si bonds via a one&#8208;step Pd/Cu/O2 system is disclosed. The difunctionalization reaction affords allylic silanes, including the allylic amine moiety, in up to 92&#8201;% yield in the absence of any acid, base, or external ligand. The developed synthetic methodology can be scaled to 100&#8197;g in high yield with high Z&#8208;selectivity, which demonstrates the feasibility of the reaction for industrial applications.

         <title>Mixed Organometallic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Assemblies Based on the Diarsene Complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;As2)], AgI Salts and N&#8208;Donor Organic Molecules</title>

Hybrid coordination polymers: The AgI monomer [Ag{[Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)]}3][TEF] ([TEF]=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]) was obtained by reaction of the organometallic diarsene complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)] with Ag[TEF]. In solution, this compound is in equilibrium with another monomeric species, [Ag{[Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)]}2][TEF], exhibiting a less&#8208;saturated AgI center. This solution mixture reacts with a variety of ditopic pyridine&#8208;based organic linkers to afford selectively 1D and 2D organometallic&#8208;organic hybrid assemblies, including a helix&#8208;like 1D structure.







Abstract
The reaction of the organometallic diarsene complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)] (1) with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (Ag[TEF]) yielded the AgI monomer [Ag(&#951;2&#8208;1)3][TEF] (2). This compound exhibits dynamic behavior in solution, which allows directed selective synthesis of unprecedented organometallic&#8211;organic hybrid assemblies upon its reaction with N&#8208;donor organic molecules by a stepwise pathway, which is supported by DFT calculations. Accordingly, the reaction of 2 with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrimidine (L1) yielded the dicationic molecular compound [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)2Ag}2(&#956;&#8208;L1)][TEF]2 (3) or the 1D polymer [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}(&#956;&#8208;L1)]n[TEF]n (4) depending on the ratio of the reactants. However, its reactions with the pyridine&#8208;based linkers 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (L2), 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (L3) and 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethyne (L4) allowed the formation of the 2D polymers [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}2(&#956;&#8208;Lx)3]n[TEF]2n [Lx=L2 (5), L3 (6), L4 (7), respectively]. Additionally, this concept was extended to step&#8208;by&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reactions of 1, [Ag(CH3CN)3][Al{OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4] ([Ag(CH3CN)3][TEFCl]) and linkers L2&#8211;L4 to produce the 2D polymers [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}2(&#956;,Lx)3]n[TEFCl]2n [Lx=L2 (8), L3 (9), L4 (10), respectively].

         <title>The Combined Use of Gold Nanoparticles and Infrared Radiation Enables Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold run: The inability of most proteins to transverse the cellular membrane hampers the development of protein therapeutics for intracellular targets. In this work, we describe the use of catalytic amounts of gold nanorods combined with near infrared laser irradiation as a strategy to trigger cytosolic delivery of proteins.







Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery remains elusive. The inability of most proteins to cross the cellular membrane is a huge hurdle. Here we explore the unique photothermal properties of gold nanorods (AuNRs) to trigger cytosolic delivery of proteins. Both partners, protein and AuNRs, are modified with a protease&#8208;resistant cell&#8208;penetrating peptide with nuclear targeting properties to induce internalization. Once internalized, spatiotemporal control of protein release is achieved by near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation in the safe second biological window. Importantly, catalytic amounts of AuNRs are sufficient to trigger cytosolic protein delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that AuNRs with their maximum of absorption in the second biological window are used to deliver proteins into the intracellular space. This strategy represents a powerful tool for the cytosolic delivery of virtually any class of protein.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture and Utilization with Isomeric Forms of Bis(amino)&#8208;Tagged Zinc Bipyrazolate Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural ZnII MOFs built with isomeric forms of diamino&#8208;tagged 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazolate linkers have been prepared and exploited in CCS/CCU applications. They are good CO2 adsorbents (because of the basic &#8722;NH2 groups) and better CO2 epoxidation catalysts if compared with their mono&#8208;amino analogue.







Abstract
Aiming at extending the tagged zinc bipyrazolate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) family, the ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (3,3&#8217;&#8208;H2L) has been synthesized in good yield. The reaction with zinc(II) acetate hydrate led to the related MOF Zn(3,3&#8217;&#8208;L). The compound is isostructural with its mono(amino) analogue Zn(BPZNH2) and with Zn(3,5&#8208;L), its isomeric parent built with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole. The textural analysis has unveiled its micro&#8208;/mesoporous nature, with a BET area of 463&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Its CO2 adsorption capacity (17.4&#8197;wt.&#8201;% CO2 at pCO2 = 1&#8197;bar and T = 298&#8197;K) and isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst = 24.8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) are comparable to that of Zn(3,5&#8208;L). Both Zn(3,3&#8217;&#8208;L) and Zn(3,5&#8208;L) have been tested as heterogeneous catalysts in the reaction of CO2 with the epoxides epichlorohydrin and epibromohydrin to give the corresponding cyclic carbonates at T = 393&#8197;K and pCO2 = 5&#8197;bar under solvent&#8208; and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. In general, the conversions recorded are higher than those found for Zn(BPZNH2), proving that the insertion of an extra amino tag in the pores is beneficial for the epoxidation catalysis. The best catalytic match has been observed for the Zn(3,5&#8208;L)/epichlorohydrin couple, with 64&#8201;% conversion and a TOF of 5.3&#8197;mmol(carbonate)&#8201;(mmolZn)&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. To gain better insights on the MOF&#8208;epoxide interaction, the crystal structure of the [epibromohydrin@Zn(3,3&#8217;&#8208;L)] adduct has been solved, confirming the existence of Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(H)&#8722;N non&#8208;bonding interactions. To our knowledge, this study represents the first structural determination of a [epibromohydrin@MOF] adduct.

         <title>Sensitive and Visual Detection of Phosgene by a TICT&#8208;Based BODIPY Dye with 8&#8208;(o&#8208;Hydroxy)aniline as the Active Site</title>

Sense and sensitivity: The fluorescent probe with 8&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy)phenyl as the active site (o&#8208;Pha) exhibits better sensing performance than the 8&#8208;(3&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy)phenyl (o&#8208;Pah). Furthermore, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe (o&#8208;Phae) has been contrasted through extending conjugation of o&#8208;Pha for colorimetric and fluorescent detections of phosgene and its substitutes in both solutions and gas phase.







Abstract
Phosgene and its substitutes (diphosgene and triphosgene) are widely utilized as chemical industrial materials and chemical warfare agents and pose a threat to public health and environmental safety due to their extreme toxicity. Research efforts have been directed to develop selective and sensitive detection methods for phosgene and its substitutes. In this paper, we have prepared two BODIPY&#8208;based fluorescent probes, o&#8208;Pah and o&#8208;Pha, which are two isomers with different active sites, ortho&#8208;aminohydroxy (3&#8242;,4&#8242; or 4&#8242;,3&#8242;) phenyls at meso position of BODIPY, and compared their sensing performance toward triphosgene. The probe with o&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl), o&#8208;Pha, exhibits better sensing performance over the o&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl), o&#8208;Pah, for instance, a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.34&#8197;nm vs. 1.2&#8197;nm), and more rapid response (10&#8197;s vs. 200&#8197;s). Furthermore, based on the above comparative studies, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe o&#8208;Phae has been constructed through extending 3,5&#8208;conjugation of o&#8208;Pha. The probe o&#8208;Phae displays rapid response (60&#8197;s), high sensitivity to triphosgene (LOD=0.88&#8197;nm), and high selectivity for triphosgene over relevant analytes including nitric oxide. Finally, a facile test strip for phosgene was fabricated by immobilizing o&#8208;Phae in a polyethylene oxide membrane for sensitive (&lt;2&#8197;ppm) and selective detection of phosgene in the gas phase.

         <title>Mechanochemically Triggered Topology Changes in Expanded Porphyrins</title>

Use the force: The H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topology of [28]hexaphyrin can be mechanically locked by applying an external pulling force to different meso positions in a sub&#8208;nano&#8208;Newton force regime. The mechanical energy is distributed to a specific region in the molecule to trigger the interconversion.







Abstract
A hitherto unexplored class of molecules for molecular force probe applications are expanded porphyrins. This work proves that mechanical force is an effective stimulus to trigger the interconversion between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topologies in [28]hexaphyrin, making these expanded porphyrins suitable to act as conformational mechanophores operating at mild (sub&#8208;1&#8197;nN) force conditions. A straightforward approach based on distance matrices is proposed for the selection of pulling scenarios that promote either the planar H&#252;ckel topology or the three lowest lying M&#246;bius topologies. This approach is supported by quantum mechanochemical calculations. Force distribution analyses reveal that [28]hexaphyrin selectively allocates the external mechanical energy to molecular regions that trigger H&#252;ckel&#8211;M&#246;bius interconversions, explaining why certain pulling scenarios favor the H&#252;ckel two&#8208;sided topology and others favor M&#246;bius single&#8208;sided topologies. The meso&#8208;substitution pattern on [28]hexaphyrin determines whether the energy difference between the different topologies can be overcome by mechanical activation.

In cellulo click chemistry to generate highly fluorescent COX&#8208;2 imaging probes in living cells is reported in this work.







Abstract
Live&#8208;cell imaging with fluorescent probes is an essential tool in chemical biology to visualize the dynamics of biological processes in real&#8208;time. Intracellular disease biomarker imaging remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional fluorescent probes and the complex nature of cells. This work reports the in cellulo assembly of a fluorescent probe to image cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2). We developed celecoxib&#8208;azide derivative 14, possessing favorable biophysical properties and excellent COX&#8208;2 selectivity profile. In cellulo strain&#8208;promoted fluorogenic click chemistry of COX&#8208;2&#8208;engaged compound&#8197;14 with non/weakly&#8208;fluorescent compounds&#8197;11 and 17 formed fluorescent probes&#8197;15 and 18 for the detection of COX&#8208;2 in living cells. Competitive binding studies, biophysical, and comprehensive computational analyses were used to describe protein&#8208;ligand interactions. The reported new chemical toolbox enables precise visualization and tracking of COX&#8208;2 in live cells with superior sensitivity in the visible range.

         <title>Strong Equatorial Crystal Field Enhances the Axial Anisotropy and Energy Barrier for Spin Reversal Process in Yb2 Single Molecule Magnets</title>

The Magnetic Two: Three new dinuclear ytterbium complexes have been synthesized. Magnetic studies reveal that a strong equatorial crystal field enhances the axial anisotropy and effective energy barrier.







Abstract
The importance of equatorial crystal fields on magnetic anisotropy of ytterbium single molecule magnets (SMMs) is observed for the first time. Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes with the formula [Yb2(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2]&#8901;DMF (1), [Yb2(3&#8208;H&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (2), and [Yb2(3&#8208;NO3&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2] (3), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H2L=N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X=OMe (1), H (2) NO2 (3)]. Detailed magnetic measurements reveal the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Yb centers and a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all complexes. A higher energy barrier for spin reversal was observed for complex&#8197;1 (Ueff=50&#8197;K) and it decreases in the order of 2 (47&#8197;K) to 3 (40&#8197;K). Notably, complex&#8197;1 shows a remarkable energy barrier within the frequency range of 1&#8211;850&#8197;Hz reported for Yb&#8208;based SMMs. Further, ab initio calculations show a higher axial anisotropy and lower quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) in the ground state for 1 compared to 2 and 3. It was also observed that the presence of a strong crystal field in the equatorial plane (when the &#8737; O1&#8722;Yb&#8722;O3 bond angle is close to 90&#176;) enhances the axial anisotropy and improves the SMM behavior in the studied complexes. Both the experimental and theoretical analysis of relaxation dynamics discloses that Raman and QTM play major role on slow relaxation process for all complexes. To provide more insight into the exchange interactions, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT calculations were performed.

Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes with the formula [Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(DMF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;DMF (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3&#8208;H&#8208;L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(DMF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and [Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3&#8208;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(DMF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X=OMe (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), H (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;)]. Detailed magnetic measurements reveal the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Yb centers and a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all complexes. A higher energy barrier for spin reversal was observed for complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;=50&#8197;K) and it decreases in the order of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (47&#8197;K) to &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; (40&#8197;K). Notably, complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a remarkable energy barrier within the frequency range of 1&#8211;850&#8197;Hz reported for Yb&#8208;based SMMs. Further, ab initio calculations show a higher axial anisotropy and lower quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) in the ground state for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; compared to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. It was also observed that the presence of a strong crystal field in the equatorial plane (when the &#8737; O1&#8722;Yb&#8722;O3 bond angle is close to 90&#176;) enhances the axial anisotropy and improves the SMM behavior in the studied complexes. Both the experimental and theoretical analysis of relaxation dynamics discloses that Raman and QTM play major role on slow relaxation process for all complexes. To provide more insight into the exchange interactions, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT calculations were performed.&lt;/p&gt;

Alkylating reagents based on thioimidazolium ionic liquids were synthesized and the influence of the anion on the alkylation reaction mechanism explored in detail using both experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
Alkylating reagents based on thioimidazolium ionic liquids were synthesized and the influence of the anion on the alkylation reaction mechanism explored in detail using both experimental and computational methods. Thioimidazolium cations transfer alkyl substituents to nucleophiles, however the reaction rate was highly dependent on anion identity, demonstrating that the anion is not innocent in the mechanism. Detailed analysis of the computationally&#8208;derived potential energy surfaces associated with possible mechanisms indicated that this dependence arises from a combination of anion induced electronic, steric and coordinating effects, with highly nucleophilic anions catalyzing a 2&#8208;step process while highly non&#8208;nucleophilic, delocalized anions favor a 1&#8208;step reaction. This work also confirms the presence of ion&#8208;pairs and aggregates in solution thus supporting anion&#8208;induced control over the reaction rate and mechanism. These findings provide new insight into an old reaction allowing for better design of cationic alkylators in synthesis, gene expression, polymer science, and protein chemistry applications.

         <title>Selective Formation of Polyaniline Confined in the Nanopores of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Supercapacitors</title>

Polymer power: Polyaniline (PANI) solely confined within the nanopores of a water&#8208;stable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without forming obvious bulk PANI between MOF crystals is synthesized. The PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films exhibit a pseudocapacitive electrochemical characteristic, and their resulting electrochemical activity is remarkably higher than those of the bulk PANI thin films.







Abstract
In this study, a strategy that can result in the polyaniline (PANI) solely confined within the nanopores of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without forming obvious bulk PANI between MOF crystals is developed. A water&#8208;stable zirconium&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, is selected as the MOF material. The polymerization of aniline is initiated in the acidic suspension of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 nanocrystals in the presence of excess poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS). Since the pore size of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 is too small to enable the insertion of the bulky PSS, the quick formation of pore&#8208;confined solid PANI and the slower formation of well dispersed PANI:PSS occur within the MOF crystals and in the bulk solution, respectively. By taking advantage of the resulting homogeneous PANI:PSS polymer solution, the bulk PANI:PSS can be removed from the PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 solid by successive washing the sample with fresh acidic solutions through centrifugation. As this is the first time reporting the PANI solely confined in the pores of a MOF, as a demonstration, the obtained PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 composite material is applied as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films exhibit a pseudocapacitive electrochemical characteristic, and their resulting electrochemical activity and charge&#8208;storage capacities are remarkably higher than those of the bulk PANI thin films.

Capacitors in the cold: Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, their performance is limited in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with NS&#8208;GF and graphene oxide exhibits a solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte, extending the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, the low energy density of electrodes and poor cold resistance of aqueous electrolytes limit their wide application in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3 because of the synergistic effect of heteroatom dual&#8208;doping. The assembled symmetric all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4/graphene oxide gel electrolyte exhibits a high capacitance of 221&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and a high energy density of 7.7&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Interestingly, solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte with 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% graphene oxide extends the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the photocatalysis effect of the dual&#8208;doped heteroatoms increases the capacitance of NS&#8208;GFs. At an ambient temperature of 0&#8201;&#176;C, the capacitance increases from 0 to 182&#8197;F cm&#8722;3 under 1&#8197;sun irradiation because of the excellent solar light absorption and efficient solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of graphene oxide, preventing the aqueous electrolyte from freezing. The flexible supercapacitor exhibits a long cycle life, good bending resistance, reliable scalability, and ability to power visual electronics, showing great potential for outdoor electronics in cold environments.

Lend me your hydrogen: Starting from an &#1013;&#8208;deaminating l&#8208;lysine dehydrogenase, we created new variants that perform the reduction of aldehydes to alcohols and the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones to amines. The reductive amination of ketones proceeded with excellent stereoselectivity. This dual AmDH/ADH activity was applied for the one&#8208;enzyme hydrogen&#8208;borrowing amination of benzylic alcohol, thus providing the first example of an &#8220;alcohol aminase&#8221; activity.







Abstract
The l&#8208;lysine&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;dehydrogenase (LysEDH) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine. We previously engineered this enzyme to create amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) variants that possess a new hydrophobic cavity in their active site such that aromatic ketones can bind and be converted into &#945;&#8208;chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivity. We also recently observed that LysEDH was capable of reducing aromatic aldehydes into primary alcohols. Herein, we harnessed the promiscuous alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity of LysEDH to create new variants that exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the reduction of substituted benzaldehydes and arylaliphatic aldehydes to primary alcohols. Notably, these novel engineered dehydrogenases also catalyzed the reductive amination of a variety of aldehydes and ketones with excellent enantioselectivity, thus exhibiting a dual AmDH/ADH activity. We envisioned that the catalytic bi&#8208;functionality of these enzymes could be applied for the direct conversion of alcohols into amines. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, we performed an unprecedented one&#8208;pot &#8220;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8221; cascade to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. Conducting the same biocatalytic cascade in the presence of cofactor recycling enzymes (i.e., NADH&#8208;oxidase and formate dehydrogenase) increased the reaction yields. In summary, this work provides the first examples of enzymes showing &#8220;alcohol aminase&#8221; activity.

Water purification: New bio&#8208;based resins were synthesized from diallyl esters of furancarboxylic acids as crosslinking agents and vinyl monomers. Polymer gels with 1&#8211;2.5&#8201;% concentration of crosslinker exhibit superior water retention properties (swelling ratio up to 50). Resins with 5&#8211;10&#8201;% of crosslinker show enhanced ion&#8208;exchange and adsorption capacities for heavy metals. Resins with 10&#8201;% crosslinker have contact&#8208;active antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
Development of sustainable bio&#8208;based materials for removal of toxic contaminants from water is a high priority goal. Novel bio&#8208;based binary and ternary copolymers with enhanced ion&#8208;exchange, adsorption and antibacterial properties were obtained by using plant biomass&#8208;derived diallyl esters of furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as crosslinking agents and easily available vinyl monomers. The synthesized copolymer materials showed higher sorption capacities for NiII, CoII and CuII compared to the commercial ion&#8208;exchange resins, and they maintained their high metal adsorption capacities for over 10&#8197;cycles of regeneration. The synthesized copolymer gels containing 1&#8211;5&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the crosslinker showed excellent water absorption capacities. The synthesized copolymers with 1&#8201;% crosslinker content showed swelling ratios high enough to also act as moisture absorbents. Synthesized copolymers with crosslinker content of 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% performed as contact&#8208;active antibacterials by inhibiting the growth of Gram&#8208;positive (S.&#8197;aureus) and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria (E.&#8197;coli, K.&#8197;pneumonia) in suspension tests.

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Substituted Aza&#8208;BODIPY Dyes: Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Enhancement for Improved Optical Limiting Performances in the Short&#8208;Wave IR Range</title>

Improved optical limiting performances: Benzothiadiazole moieties act as powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing auxiliaries enforcing the accepting character of aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes and resulting in a significant redshift of both absorption and emission and a remarkable enhancement of the nonlinear optical properties (two&#8208;photon absorption and optical limiting) compared with traditional aryl substituents.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;boron dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPYs) presenting a benzothiadiazole substitution on upper positions are described. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the benzothiadiazole moiety permits enhancement of the accepting strength and improves the delocalization of the aza&#8208;BODIPY core to attain a significant degree of electronic communication between the lower donating groups and the upper accepting groups. The nature of the intramolecular charge transfer is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Linear spectroscopy highlighted the strongly redshifted absorption and emission of the synthesized molecules with recorded fluorescence spectra over 1000&#8197;nm. Nonlinear optical properties were also investigated. Strong enhancement of the two&#8208;photon absorption of the substituted dyes compared with the unsubstituted one (up to 4520&#8197;GM at 1300&#8197;nm) results in an approximately 15&#8211;20&#8201;% improvement of the optical power limiting performances. These dyes are therefore a good starting point for further improvement of optical power limiting in the short&#8208;wave IR range.

         <title>Synthesis of Mixed&#8208;Functionalized Tetraacylgermanes</title>

Just mix it! Mixed&#8208;functionalized tetraacylgermanes were synthesized by two innovative pathways. These new derivatives outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art germanium based photoinitiators in terms of both solubility and absorption properties.







Abstract
Tetraacylgermanes are known as highly efficient photoinitiators. Herein, the synthesis of mixed tetraacylgermanes 4&#8201;a&#8211;c and 6&#8201;a&#8211;e with a nonsymmetric substitution pattern is presented. Germenolates are crucial intermediates of these new synthetic protocols. The synthesized compounds show increased solubility compared with symmetrically substituted tetraacylgermanes 1&#8201;a&#8211;d. Moreover, these mixed derivatives reveal broadened n&#8211;&#960;* absorption bands, which enhance their photoactivity. Higher absorption of these new compounds at wavelengths above 450&#8197;nm causes efficient photobleaching when using an LED emitting at 470&#8197;nm. The quantum yields are in the range of 0.15&#8211;0.57, depending on the nature of the aroyl substituents. On the basis of these properties, mixed&#8208;functionalized tetraacylgermanes serve as ideal photoinitiators in various applications, especially in those requiring high penetration depth. The synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, NMR and CIDNP spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, photolysis experiments, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The CIDNP data suggest that the germyl radicals generated from the new tetraacylgermanes preferentially add to the tail of the monomer butyl acrylate. In the case of 6&#8201;a&#8211;e only the mesitoyl groups are cleaved off, whereas for 4&#8201;a&#8211;c both the mesitoyl and the aroyl group are subject to &#945;&#8208;cleavage.

The 6&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization of the first diyne unit (blue) with two alkynes in peri&#8208;position induces a switch to a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclization for the second peri&#8208;diyne unit (red) in the fast modular synthesis of new extended &#960;&#8208;systems.







Abstract
A simple gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 1,8&#8208;dialkynylnaphthalenes utilizing a cationic gold catalyst was developed. Such a peri&#8208;position of two alkynyl substituents has not been studied in gold catalysis before. Dependent on the substrate, the reactions either follow a mechanism involving vinyl cation intermediates or involve a dual gold catalysis mechanism which in an initial 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;cyclization generates gold(I) vinylidene intermediates that are able to insert into C&#8722;H bonds. Indenophenalene derivatives were obtained in moderate to high yields. In addition, the bidirectional gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation of tetraynes provided even larger conjugated &#960;&#8208;systems. The optoelectronic properties of the products were also investigated.

         <title>Synchronous Electrocatalytic Design of Architectural and Electronic Structure Based on Bifunctional LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF toward Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3367-3373, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional electrocatalysts based on LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF are prepared, and their activities toward water splitting are reported. Among the materials studied, NiFe&#8208;LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF with optimized electronic structure and hierarchical heterostructure demonstrates excellent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 214&#8197;mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 162&#8197;mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The rational design of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting is extremely urgent for application in sustainable energy conversion processes to alleviate the energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, through simple deposition of layered double hydroxides (LDH) on Co3O4/NF (NF=nickel foam) nanosheets arrays, hierarchical Co3+&#8208;rich materials based on LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF are prepared as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting. The NiFe&#8208;LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF demonstrates excellent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 214&#8197;mV for the OER and an overpotential of 162&#8197;mV for the HER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Such a performance is attributed to the optimized electronic states with a high concentration of Co3+, which improves the intrinsic activity, and the sheet&#8208;on&#8208;sheet hierarchical structure, which increases the number of active sites. The unique synchronous design of both the architectural and electronic structure of nanomaterials can simultaneously accelerate the reaction kinetics and provide a more convenient charge transfer path. Therefore, the strategy reported herein may open a new pathway for the design of excellent electrocatalysts for water splitting.

         <title>Similarities and Differences between Crystal and Enzyme Environmental Effects on the Electron Density of Drug Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3407-3419, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarization of a drug molecule in an enzyme environment can be approximated by the polarization of the same molecule in its small&#8208;molecule crystal structure. The degree of similarity is quantified in this study for a model compound of the protease inhibitor loxistatin acid in its interaction with cathepsin&#8197;B by using interaction densities and interaction electrostatic potentials.







Abstract
The crystal interaction density is generally assumed to be a suitable measure of the polarization of a low&#8208;molecular weight ligand inside an enzyme, but this approximation has seldomly been tested and has never been quantified before. In this study, we compare the crystal interaction density and the interaction electrostatic potential for a model compound of loxistatin acid (E64c) with those inside cathepsin&#8197;B, in solution, and in vacuum. We apply QM/MM calculations and experimental quantum crystallography to show that the crystal interaction density is indeed very similar to the enzyme interaction density. Less than 0.1&#8197;e are shifted between these two environments in total. However, this difference has non&#8208;negligible consequences for derived properties.

Side&#8208;chain engineering through hydrogen bonding: Hydrogen&#8208;bonding terminal substituents can be used as structure&#8208;directing motifs to tailor the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state. This approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.







Abstract
The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interaction with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which had the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformation mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically by side&#8208;chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Ni2P Interlayer and Mn Doping Synergistically Expedite the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics of Co2P</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3536-3541, February 15, 2021. </description>

A hierarchical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co2P@an intermediate layer of Ni2P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is prepared. Note that there is an electron channel between NiP and MnCoP, electrons in Ni transfer to Co and P, which effectively weakens the strong adsorption capacity of H* and expedites the HER kinetics of Co2P.







Abstract
Transition metal phosphide is regarded as one of the most promising candidates to replace noble&#8208;metal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the controllable design and synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts with efficient and stable electrochemical performance are still very challenging. Herein, a novel hierarchical HER electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co2P@an intermediate layer of Ni2P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is reported. Notably, both the incorporation of Mn and introduction of the Ni2P interlayer promote Co atoms to carry more electrons, which is beneficial to reduce the force of the Co&#8722;H bond and optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediate (|&#916;GH*|), thereby making MnCoP/NiP/NF exhibit outstanding HER performance with onset overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 31.2&#8197;mV and 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, respectively, in 1&#8201;m KOH electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hierarchical hydrogen evolution&lt;/b&gt; reaction (HER) electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P@an intermediate layer of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is prepared. Note that there is an electron channel between NiP and MnCoP, electrons in Ni transfer to Co and P, which effectively weakens the strong adsorption capacity of H* and expedites the HER kinetics of Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal phosphide is regarded as one of the most promising candidates to replace noble&#8208;metal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the controllable design and synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts with efficient and stable electrochemical performance are still very challenging. Herein, a novel hierarchical HER electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P@an intermediate layer of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is reported. Notably, both the incorporation of Mn and introduction of the Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P interlayer promote Co atoms to carry more electrons, which is beneficial to reduce the force of the Co&#8722;H bond and optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediate (|&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H*&lt;/sub&gt;|), thereby making MnCoP/NiP/NF exhibit outstanding HER performance with onset overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 31.2&#8197;mV and 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, in 1&#8201;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning of Bistability, Thermal Stability of the Metastable States, and Application Prospects in the C3&#8208;Symmetric Designs of Multiple Azo(hetero)arenes Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
What matters in the photoswitching and thermal stability and application prospects in tripodal photoswitchable systems? Factors controlling near&#8208;quantitative photoisomerization in both directions (bistability) and the thermal stability of the metastable states together with an evaluation of the impact of designs in obtaining reversible photo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel phase transitions, solvatochromism, photo&#8208; and thermochromism are investigated.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive molecular systems with multiple photoswitches in C3&#8208;symmetric designs have enormous application potential. The design part of such molecular systems is critical due to its influence in several properties associated with the photoswitches. In order to tune, and in the evaluation of the design&#8211;property relationship, we synthesized 18 tripodal systems with variations in the core, linkers, connectivity, and azo(hetero)arene photoswitches. Through extensive spectroscopic and computational studies, we envisaged the factors controlling near&#8208;quantitative photoisomerization in both the directions (bistability) and the thermal stability of the metastable states. Furthermore, we also evaluated the impact of designs in obtaining reversible photo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel phase transitions, solvatochromism, photo&#8208; and thermochromism.

Qualitatively different structures and electron transfer behavior have been established for platinum and palladium complexes [PtL2]0/+ and [Pd2L4]0/+ with a redox&#8208;active amidinato ligand L&#8722;/L..







Abstract
Reaction of [Pt(DMSO)2Cl2] or [Pd(MeCN)2Cl2] with the electron&#8208;rich LH=N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)ethanimidamide yielded mononuclear [PtL2] (1) but dinuclear [Pd2L4] (2), a paddle&#8208;wheel complex. The neutral compounds were characterized through experiments (crystal structures, electrochemistry, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy, magnetic resonance) and TD&#8208;DFT calculations as metal(II) species with noninnocent ligands L&#8722;. The reversibly accessible cations [PtL2]+ and [Pd2L4]+ were also studied, the latter as [Pd2L4][B{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}4] single crystals. Experimental and computational investigations were directed at the elucidation of the electronic structures, establishing the correct oxidation states within the alternatives [PtII(L&#8722;)2] or [Pt.(L&#8201;)2], [PtII(L0.5&#8722;)2]+ or [PtIII(L&#8722;)2]+, [(PdII)2(&#956;&#8208;L&#8722;)4] or [(Pd1.5)2(&#956;&#8208;L0.75&#8722;)4], and [(Pd2.5)2(&#956;&#8208;L&#8722;)4]+ or [(PdII)2(&#956;&#8208;L0.75&#8722;)4]+. In each case, the first alternative was shown to be most appropriate. Remarkable results include the preference of platinum for mononuclear planar [PtL2] with an N&#8208;Pt&#8208;N bite angle of 62.8(2)&#176; in contrast to [Pd2L4], and the dimetal (Pd24+&#8594;Pd25+) instead of ligand (L&#8722;&#8594;L&#8201;) oxidation of the dinuclear palladium compound.

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane: A Versatile Fluoride Acceptor for Transition Metal Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of titanium, nickel, and copper complexes stabilized by the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722; (FAP anion) was obtained on reaction of the parent fluoride complexes with the strong Lewis acid (C2F5)3PF2. The reaction products depend on the solvent used or additional Lewis bases present during the fluoride transfer from the metal complexes to the phosphorane.







Abstract
Fluoride abstraction from different types of transition metal fluoride complexes [LnMF] (M=Ti, Ni, Cu) by the Lewis acid tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane (C2F5)3PF2 to yield cationic transition metal complexes with the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate counterion (FAP anion, [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722;) is reported. (C2F5)3PF2 reacted with trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(ArF)F] (iPr2Im=1,3&#8208;diisopropylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; ArF=C6F5, 1&#8201;a; 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;b; 4&#8208;C6F5&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;c) through fluoride transfer to form the complex salts trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(solv)(ArF)]FAP (2&#8201;a&#8208;c[solv]; solv=Et2O, CH2Cl2, THF) depending on the reaction medium. In the presence of stronger Lewis bases such as carbenes or PPh3, solvent coordination was suppressed and the complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(PPh3)(C6F5)]FAP (trans&#8208;2&#8201;a[PPh3]) and cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(Dipp2Im)(C6F5)]FAP (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a[Dipp2Im]) (Dipp2Im=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were isolated. Fluoride abstraction from [(Dipp2Im)CuF] (3) in CH2Cl2 or 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene led to the isolation of [{(Dipp2Im)Cu}2]2+2&#8201;FAP&#8722; (4). Subsequent reaction of 4 with PPh3 and different carbenes resulted in the complexes [(Dipp2Im)Cu(LB)]FAP (5&#8201;a&#8211;e, LB=Lewis base). In the presence of C6Me6, fluoride transfer afforded [(Dipp2Im)Cu(C6Me6)]FAP (5&#8201;f), which serves as a source of [(Dipp2Im)Cu)]+. Fluoride abstraction of [Cp2TiF2] (7) resulted in the formation of dinuclear [FCp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;F)TiCp2F]FAP (8) (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5) with one terminal fluoride ligand at each titanium atom and an additional bridging fluoride ligand.

         <title>Iridium(III) Sensitisers and Energy Upconversion: The Influence of Ligand Structure upon TTA&#8208;UC Performance</title>

Red, red shine: A series of substituted naphthylquinolines have been synthesised and investigated as cylcometallating ligands for IrIII. The resultant complexes were shown to be emissive in the deep&#8208;red region and several were identified as viable photosensitisers for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion.







Abstract
Six substituted ligands based upon 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate have been synthesised in two steps from a range of commercially available isatin derivatives. These species are shown to be effective cyclometallating ligands for IrIII, yielding complexes of the form [Ir(C^N)2(bipy)]PF6 (where C^N=cyclometallating ligand; bipy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples demonstrate that the complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry wherein a cis&#8208;C,C and trans&#8208;N,N coordination mode is observed. Intraligand torsional distortions are evident in all cases. The IrIII complexes display photoluminescence in the red part of the visible region (668&#8211;693&#8197;nm), which is modestly tuneable through the ligand structure. The triplet lifetimes of the complexes are clearly influenced by the precise structure of the ligand in each case. Supporting computational (DFT) studies suggest that the differences in observed triplet lifetime are likely due to differing admixtures of ligand&#8208;centred versus MLCT character instilled by the facets of the ligand structure. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) measurements demonstrate that the complexes based upon the 1&#8208;naphthyl derived ligands are viable photosensitisers with upconversion quantum efficiencies of 1.6&#8211;6.7&#8201;%.

A series of HBX derivatives (HBX=(2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole)), mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalized with ethynyl&#8208;TIPS substituents at various positions, were synthesized and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. Variation of the nature of the heteroring revealed a strong influence of the heteroatom, in terms of emission wavelength, stabilization of the first excited&#8208;state and most importantly quantum yields values.







Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzazole (HBX) fluorophores are well&#8208;known excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) emitters largely studied for their synthetic versatility, photostability, strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence and ability to engineer dual emission, thus paving the way to applications as white emitters, ratiometric sensors, and cryptographic dyes. However, they are heavily quenched in solution, due to efficient non&#8208;radiative pathways taking place as a consequence of the proton transfer in the excited&#8208;state. In this contribution, the nature of the heteroring constitutive of these rigidified HBX dyes was modified and we demonstrate that this simple structural modification triggers major optical changes in terms of emission color, dual emission engineering, and importantly, fluorescent quantum yield. Investigation of the photophysical properties in solution and in the solid state of a series of ethynyl&#8208;TIPS extended HBX fluorophores, along with ab initio calculations demonstrate the very promising abilities of these dyes to act as bright dual&#8208;state emitters, in both solution (even in protic environments) and solid state.

Unconventional elements: New macrocyclic compounds containing tricoordinate boron and germanium show characteristic fluoride responses in their optical properties, depending on their structures. This indicates that the element&#8208;hybrid macrocyclic system is promising as a new class of fluoride sensor material.







Abstract
The introduction of unconventional elements into &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has been studied to manipulate the electronic states and properties of compounds. Herein, boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing hybrid macrocycles, as a new class of element&#8208;hybrid conjugated systems, have been synthesized. The palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille cross coupling of bis(bromothienyl)borane and bis(trimethylstannylthienyl)&#8208; or bis(trimethylstannylphenyl)&#8208;substituted dithienogermoles as the boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing building blocks, respectively, produced a mixture of several macrocyclic compounds. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the 2:2 coupling product revealed a planar structure with a cavity inside the macrocycle. The optical properties of the macrocyclic products indicated rather small electronic interactions between the building units. However, intramolecular photoenergy transfer from the dithienogermole unit to the boron unit was clearly observed with respect to the fluorescence spectra.

         <title>Synthesis of Carbapenems Containing Peptidoglycan Mimetics and Inhibition of the Cross&#8208;Linking Activity of a Transpeptidase of l,d Specificity</title>

Main and side chains mimetics: A synthetic route to carbapenems modified at position C8 was developed to assess the impact of mimetics of the main and side chains of peptidoglycan precursors on cross&#8208;linking activity of l,d&#8208;transpeptidase from E. faecium. Substitution at position C8 can be therefore used to modulate the properties of carbapenem without deleterious effects on the efficacy of l,d&#8208;transpeptidase inhibition.







Abstract
The carbapenem class of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been optimized against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria producing extended&#8208;spectrum &#946;&#8208;lactamases by introducing substituents at position C2. Carbapenems are currently investigated for the treatment of tuberculosis as these drugs are potent covalent inhibitors of l,d&#8208;transpeptidases involved in mycobacterial cell wall assembly. The optimization of carbapenems for inactivation of these unusual targets is sought herein by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the C8 hydroxyl group to introduce chemical diversity. As &#946;&#8208;lactams are structure analogs of peptidoglycan precursors, the substituents were chosen to increase similarity between the drug and the substrate. Fourteen peptido&#8208;carbapenems were efficiently synthesized. They were more effective than the reference drug, meropenem, owing to the positive impact of a phenethylthio substituent introduced at position C2 but the peptidomimetics added at position C8 did not further improve the activity. Thus, position C8 can be modified to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of highly efficient carbapenems.

         <title>Intramolecular Halo Stabilization of Silyl Cations&#8212;Silylated Halonium&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Halo&#8208;Substituted Siliconium Borates</title>

Silyl cation or halonium ion? That&#8242;s the question: The Corey reaction of acenaphthyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;based silanes allows the synthesis of silyl halonium ions, the nature of which was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations. Moreover, the chloro&#8208; and bromonium ion can react with the starting silane to form penta&#8208;coordinated siliconium ions, which are intramolecularly stabilized by electron donation from both halogen atoms.







Abstract
The stabilizing neighboring effect of halo substituents on silyl cations was tested for a series of peri&#8208;halo substituted acenaphthyl&#8208;based silyl cations 3. The chloro&#8208; (3&#8201;b), bromo&#8208; (3&#8201;c), and iodo&#8208; (3&#8201;d) stabilized cations were synthesized by the Corey protocol. Structural and NMR spectroscopic investigations for cations 3&#8201;b&#8211;d supported by the results of density functional calculations, which indicate their halonium ion nature. According to the fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method, the silyl Lewis acidity decreases along the series of halonium ions 3, the fluoronium ion 3&#8201;a being a very strong and the iodonium ion 3&#8201;d a moderate Lewis acid. Halonium ions 3&#8201;b and 3&#8201;c react with starting silanes in a substituent redistribution reaction and form siliconium ions 4&#8201;b and 4&#8201;c. The structure of siliconium borate 4&#8201;c2[B12Br12] reveals the trigonal bipyramidal coordination environment of the silicon atom with the two bromo substituents in the apical positions.

         <title>Interface Amorphization of Two&#8208;Dimensional Black Phosphorus upon Treatment with Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3361-3366, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of diazonium salts to black phosphorus intercalation compounds does not lead to covalent functionalization, instead it causes a drastic structural evolution in the interface of few&#8208;layer BP leading to amorphous red phosphorus.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) represents one of the most appealing 2D materials due to its electronic, optical, and chemical properties. Many strategies have been pursued to face its environmental instability, covalent functionalization being one of the most promising. However, the extremely low functionalization degrees and the limitations in proving the nature of the covalent functionalization still represent challenges in many of these sheet architectures reported to date. Here we shine light on the structural evolution of 2D&#8208;BP upon the addition of electrophilic diazonium salts. We demonstrated the absence of covalent functionalization in both the neutral and the reductive routes, observing in the latter case an unexpected interface conversion of BP to red phosphorus (RP), as characterized by Raman, 31P&#8208;MAS NMR, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;GC&#8208;MS), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) gave insights into the potential underlying radical mechanism, suggesting a Sandmeyer&#8208;like reaction.

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Catalysis in Carbon Flatland&#8212;Flipping [8]Annulene on Graphene</title>

Flipping catalysts! Unlike hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are rarely the sole driving force of catalysis. Computational modeling shows that pristine graphene flakes may efficiently catalyze the skeletal inversions of various benzannulated [8]annulene derivatives. An energy decomposition analysis highlights the increasingly important role played by dispersion interactions in this catalysis with increasing system size.







Abstract
Noncovalent interactions are an integral part of the modern catalysis toolbox. Although stronger noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding are commonly the main driving force of catalysis, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions typically provide smaller additional stabilizations, for example, to afford selectivity enhancements. Here, it is shown computationally that pristine graphene flakes may efficiently catalyze the skeletal inversions of various benzannulated cyclooctatetraene derivatives, providing an example of a catalytic process driven solely by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. Hereby, the catalytic effect results from disproportionate shape complementarity between catalyst and transition structure compared with catalyst and reactant. An energy decomposition analysis reveals electrostatic and, especially with increasing system size, to a larger extent, dispersion interactions as the origin of stabilization.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3457-3462, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3 or N1? Chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of indoles was developed by using a rhodium/bisoxazolinephosphane catalyst. C3 or N1 selectivity could be selectively achieved by changing the counteranion of Rh, the allylic carbonate, the reaction temperature, and the ligand.







Abstract
The control of C3/N1 chemoselectivity in indole alkylation with the same electrophiles is still challenging. An Rh/bisoxazolinephosphane&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of indoles was developed. Chiral C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;allylindoles can be selectively obtained with high branched/linear ratio and up to 99&#8201;% ee by changing the counteranion of Rh, the allylic carbonate, the reaction temperature, and the ligand.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C3 or N1?&lt;/b&gt; Chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of indoles was developed by using a rhodium/bisoxazolinephosphane catalyst.

         <title>Ferrous to Ferric Transition in Fe&#8208;Phthalocyanine Driven by NO2 Exposure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3526-3535, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, the possibility to control, via nitrogen dioxide (NO2) dissociation at the interface, the magnetic properties of the chelated ion the FePc array is demonstrated. Three different spin configurations have been stabilized within the same metalorganic/metal interface.







Abstract
Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here, we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe d&#8208;states of FePc and the sp&#8208;band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The FeII ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO2 dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO2 at room temperature.

In cellulo generation of fluorescent probes is an essential tool in chemical biology to visualize the dynamics of biological processes in real&#8208;time. A highly flexible in cellulo fluorogenic click chemistry strategy was developed and tested for the precise detection and tracking of inflammation and cancer biomarker cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) in live cells with superior sensitivity in the visible range. More information can be found in the Full Paper by F. Wuest et&#8197;al. on page 3326.

Mixed functionalized tetraacylgermanes were synthesized by two innovative pathways. The entry in both strategies was provides by tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)germane. In both routes, the crucial intermediate, the germenolate, was formed, leading to the desired products. These new derivatives outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art germanium&#8208;based photoinitiators in terms of solubility and absorption properties.

Self&#8208;propelled micromotors with a reversible braking system are shown. Manganese ions are embedded in microporous silica nanoparticles to catalyse the degradation of the H2O2 &#8220;fuel&#8221; to water and gaseous oxygen. The bubbles formation propels the microparticles in a rapid forward&#8208;thrusting motion. The micromotors are decorated with thermoresponsive polyphosphazenes which expand/collapse in a temperature&#8208;driven response to regulate the flow of fuel to the motor and thus control their velocity. More information can be found in the Communication by I.&#8197;Teasdale, Y.&#8197;Salinas, et&#8197;al. on page 3262.

         <title>Frontispiece: Pushing the Limits of Acene Chemistry: The Recent Surge of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acenes are a fundamental class of organic &#960; conjugated aromatic compounds. Due to the linear annulation of benzene building blocks, they acquire high reactivity with increasing lengths that limited their experimental accessibility for a long time. The Review by C. T&#246;nshoff and H.&#8197;F. Bettinger on page 3193 summarizes recent synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational progress on acene molecules that significantly enhanced the understanding of this fascinating class of compounds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylic acids are employed as the vital starting materials in organic synthesis. Various aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids participate in electrochemical decarboxylative transformations in which CO2 gets liberated and generate the active carbocation species that reacted with various nucleophiles to produce the C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;halogen bonds. L. Tian, Y. Wang et al. discuss the recent developments in the decarboxylation of carboxylic acid derivatives using electrosynthesis in the Minireview on page 3213.

         <title>Frontispiece: Optical Characteristics of Hybrid Macrocycles with Dithienogermole and Tricoordinate Boron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New conjugated macrocycles consisting of tricoordinate boron units and dithienogermole (DTG) were prepared by Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The element&#8208;hybrid macrocycles exhibited energy transfer from the DTG units to the macrocyclic backbone in the fluorescence spectra. In the fluoride titration experiments, clear turn&#8208;on and turn&#8208;off fluorescence responses were observed for different conjugated linkers. For more information, see the Full Paper by F. J&#228;kle and J. Ohshita et&#8197;al. on page 3306.

         <title>Cover Feature: Generation of Oxidoreductases with Dual Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Amine Dehydrogenase Activity (Chem. Eur. J. 10/2021)</title>

The catalytic promiscuity of LysEDH&#8212;which naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l&#8208;lysine at the &#1013;&#8208;amino group&#8212;was harnessed to create variants that exhibited alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) activities. These ADH and AmDH activities could be switched by changing the reaction conditions. The dual ADH&#8208;AmDH activity (i.e., alcohol aminase) was applied to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. The artwork illustrates a &#8220;water lever&#8221; that represents the switch of the enzyme's activity from an AmDH to an ADH and vice versa.

High&#8208;Z nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have attracted attention in oncology as X&#8208;ray contrast agents and radiosensitizers that enhance the effect of radiation therapy.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray radiation is commonly employed in clinical practice for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Over the past decade, developments in nanotechnology have led to the use of high&#8208;Z elements as the basis for innovative new treatment platforms that enhance the clinical efficacy of X&#8208;ray radiation. Nanoscale metal&#8211;frameworks (nMOFs) are coordination networks containing organic ligands that have attracted attention as therapeutic platforms in oncology and other areas of medicine. In cancer therapy, X&#8208;ray activated, high&#8208;Z nMOFs have demonstrated potential as radiosensitizers that increase local radiation dose deposition and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This minireview summarizes current research on high&#8208;Z nMOFs in cancer theranostics and discusses factors that may influence future clinical application.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Acene Chemistry: The Recent Surge of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3193-3212, February 15, 2021. </description>

Ring changes: Rooted in advances in organic synthesis and combined with specialized techniques for generation and study of highly reactive molecules, longer and longer acenes have became accessible for experimental investigations. Combined with sophisticated modern computational chemistry techniques, an encompassing picture of this unusual class of alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emerges.







Abstract
Acenes, consisting of linearly fused benzene rings, are an important fundamental class of organic compounds with various applications. Hexacene is the largest acene that was synthesized and isolated in the 20th century. The next largest member of the acene family, heptacene, was observed in 2007 and since then significant progress in preparing acenes has been reported. Significantly larger acenes, up to undecacene, could be studied by means of low&#8208;temperature matrix isolation spectroscopy with in situ photolytic generation, and up to dodecacene by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis employing innovative precursors and highly defined crystalline metal surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The review summarizes recent experimental and theoretical advances in the area of acenes that give a significantly deeper insight into the fundamental properties and nature of the electronic structure of this fascinating class of organic compounds.

Significantly larger acenes, up to undecacene, could be studied by means of low&#8208;temperature matrix isolation spectroscopy with in situ photolytic generation, and up to dodecacene by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis employing innovative precursors and highly defined crystalline metal surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The review summarizes recent experimental and theoretical advances in the area of acenes that give a significantly deeper insight into the fundamental properties and nature of the electronic structure of this fascinating class of organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Silicon&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Formation via Heterodehydrocoupling and Catalytic N&#8208;Silylation</title>

A catalytic block party: Heterodehydrocoupling and N&#8208;silylation are atom&#8208;economical methods for the synthesis of silicon&#8211;nitrogen small molecules, polymers, and materials. Various catalysts across the periodic table are capable of producing silicon&#8211;nitrogen bonds. A thorough report of catalysts, their reactivities, and mechanisms are reported in this Minireview.







Abstract
Silicon&#8211;nitrogen bond formation is an important subfield in main group chemistry, and catalysis is an attractive route for efficient, selective formation of these bonds. Indeed, heterodehydrocoupling and N&#8208;silylation offer facile methods for the synthesis of small molecules through the coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes with N&#8208;containing substrates such as amines, carbazoles, indoles, and pyrroles. However, the reactivity of these catalytic systems is far from uniform, and critical issues are often encountered with product selectivity, conversions, substrate scope, catalyst activation, and in some instances, competing side reactions. Herein, a catalogue of catalysts and their reactivity for Si&#8722;N heterodehydrocoupling and N&#8208;silylation are reported.

Electrochemical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids has become a significant method in electro&#8208;organic synthesis which allows a one&#8208;step carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation as well as other heteroatom bond formation such as C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;halogen under mild conditions. This Minireview discusses the current progress in electrochemical decarboxylation reactions and gives a detailed overview of useful organic transformations of various carboxylic acids with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Owing to their non&#8208;toxic, stable, inexpensive properties, carboxylic acids are considered as environmentally benign alternatives as coupling partners in various organic transformations. Electrochemical mediated decarboxylation of carboxylic acid has emerged as a new and efficient methodology for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Compared with transition&#8208;metal catalysis and photoredox catalysis, electro&#8208;organic decarboxylative transformations are considered as a green and sustainable protocol due to the absence of chemical oxidants and strong bases. Further, it exhibits good tolerance with various functional groups. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advances and discoveries on the electrochemical decarboxylative transformations on C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatoms bond formations.

NHC organocatalysis: The development of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis presents new opportunities in radical reactions. The Breslow intermediate&#8208;based radical cations, which could be generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation or reduction, enabled a series of novel radical transformations. These advancements greatly extend the synthetic potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis.







Abstract
Over the past decades, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has undergone a flourish of development on the basis of closed&#8208;shell reaction paths. By contrast, the emerging area of single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions enabled by NHC catalysis still remain underdeveloped, but offer plenty of opportunities to develop new catalytic modes and useful synthetic methods. A number of interesting transformations were triggered by the SET process from the electron&#8208;rich Breslow intermediates to various single&#8208;electron acceptors. In additions, recent studies revealed that the Breslow radical cations could also be generated by single&#8208;electron reduction of the electron&#8208;deficient acyl azolium intermediates. These discoveries open a new avenue for NHC organocatalysis to harness radical reactions. The present review will focus on the exciting advancements in the dynamic area of radical NHC organocatalysis.

         <title>Activation of CS2 and CO2 by Silylium Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3288-3291, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The valence&#8208;isolectronic three&#8208;atomic molecules CS2 and CO2 react in a series of consecutive reactions with the hydride&#8208;bridged silylium cation [Et3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiEt3]+ to give a number of new silyl&#8208;substituted sulfonium or oxonium ions, respectively. Crystal structure determinations and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations give detailed insight into the reaction cascade (see scheme).







Abstract
The hydride&#8208;bridged silylium cation [Et3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiEt3]+, stabilized by the weakly coordinating [Me3NB12Cl11]&#8722; anion, undergoes, in the presence of excess silane, a series of unexpected consecutive reactions with the valence&#8208;isoelectronic molecules CS2 and CO2. The final products of the reaction with CS2 are methane and the previously unknown [(Et3Si)3S]+ cation. To gain insight into the entire reaction cascade, numerous experiments with varying conditions were performed, intermediate products were intercepted, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Besides the [(Et3Si)3S]+ cation as the final product, crystal structures of [(Et3Si)2SMe]+, [Et3SiS(H)Me]+, and [Et3SiOC(H)OSiEt3]+ were obtained. Experimental results combined with supporting quantum&#8208;chemical calculations in the gas phase and solution allow a detailed understanding of the reaction cascade.

         <title>Controlled Shape Evolution of Pure&#8208;MOF 1D Microcrystals towards Efficient Waveguide and Laser Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3297-3301, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The shape evolution of pure&#8208;MOF 1D&#8208;microcrystals with ideal nanophotonics functions was firstly achieved based on a bottom&#8208;up/top&#8208;down synergistic method. These microcrystals enable evolution from microrods via microtubes to nanowires with efficient optical waveguide and laser applications.







Abstract
MOF&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional materials have received increasing attention in the nanophotonics field, but it is still difficult in the flexible shape evolution of MOF micro/nanocrystals for desired optical functionalities due to the susceptible solvothermal growth process. Herein, we report on the well&#8208;controlled shape evolution of pure&#8208;MOF microcrystals with optical waveguide and lasing performances based on a bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down synergistic method. The MOF microcrystals from solvothermal synthesis (bottom&#8208;up) enable the evolution from microrods via microtubes to nanowires through a chelating agent&#8208;assisted etching process (top&#8208;down). The three types of MOF 1D&#8208;microstructures with high crystallinity and smooth surfaces all exhibit efficient optical waveguide performance. Furthermore, MOF nanowire with lowest propagation loss served as low&#8208;threshold pure&#8208;MOF nanolasers with Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance.

     alt="Controlled Shape Evolution of Pure&#8208;MOF 1D Microcrystals towards Efficient Waveguide and Laser Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The shape evolution&lt;/b&gt; of pure&#8208;MOF 1D&#8208;microcrystals with ideal nanophotonics functions was firstly achieved based on a bottom&#8208;up/top&#8208;down synergistic method. These microcrystals enable evolution from microrods via microtubes to nanowires with efficient optical waveguide and laser applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOF&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional materials have received increasing attention in the nanophotonics field, but it is still difficult in the flexible shape evolution of MOF micro/nanocrystals for desired optical functionalities due to the susceptible solvothermal growth process. Herein, we report on the well&#8208;controlled shape evolution of pure&#8208;MOF microcrystals with optical waveguide and lasing performances based on a bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down synergistic method. The MOF microcrystals from solvothermal synthesis (bottom&#8208;up) enable the evolution from microrods via microtubes to nanowires through a chelating agent&#8208;assisted etching process (top&#8208;down). The three types of MOF 1D&#8208;microstructures with high crystallinity and smooth surfaces all exhibit efficient optical waveguide performance. Furthermore, MOF nanowire with lowest propagation loss served as low&#8208;threshold pure&#8208;MOF nanolasers with Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance. These results advance the fundamental understanding on the controlled MOF evolution mechanism, and offer a valuable route for the development of pure&#8208;MOF&#8208;based photonic components with desired functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogel of Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 and Laponite&#174;: Size&#8208;Selective Hydrogenation Catalyst under Mild Conditions</title>

Fine&#8208;tuning hydrogenation: A thermally stable hydrogel nanocomposite has been prepared by charge&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly of Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles with Laponite&#174; nanoclay. The resulting Pd@ZIF&#8208;8+LP nanocomposite showed efficient and size&#8208;selective catalytic hydrogenation of olefins.







Abstract
The composite hydrogel of a nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (NMOF) and nanoclay has emerged as a new soft&#8208;material with advanced properties and applications. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of a hydrogel nanocomposite by charge&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly of Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles with Laponite&#174; nanoclay which coat the surface of Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles. Such surface coating significantly enhanced the thermal stability of the ZIF&#8208;8 compared to the pristine framework. Further, the Pd@ZIF&#8208;8+LP hydrogel nanocomposite shows better size&#8208;selective catalytic hydrogenation of olefins than Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles based on selective diffusion of the substrate.

Caged: A self&#8208;assembled hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage, where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage is prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a unique molecular container is reported: a hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage was prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand. It was also shown that the hybrid cage could be prepared by integrative self&#8208;sorting from simple components. For the first time the genuine dual character of the hybrid cage was manifested as both self&#8208;assembling parts responded selectively to different stimuli (such as phosphine and cyanurate), which resulted in the disassembly of the cage.

         <title>Iminoboronates as Dual&#8208;Purpose Linkers in Chemical Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3292-3296, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iminoboronate chemistry enables the synthesis of chemical probes that selectively label proteins of interest from 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid reactive groups and hydrazide&#8208;functionalized ligands. The reversibility of the iminoboronate linkage is exploited to detect the labeled proteins by ligand&#8208;fluorophore exchange. Remarkably, the fast iminoboronate chemistry even allows probe formation within protein mixtures.







Abstract
Chemical probes that covalently modify proteins of interest are powerful tools for the research of biological processes. Important in the design of a probe is the choice of reactive group that forms the covalent bond, as it decides the success of a probe. However, choosing the right reactive group is not a simple feat and methodologies for expedient screening of different groups are needed. We herein report a modular approach that allows easy coupling of a reactive group to a ligand. &#945;&#8208;Nucleophile ligands are combined with 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid derived reactive groups to form iminoboronate probes that selectively label their target proteins. A transimination reaction on the labeled proteins with an &#945;&#8208;amino hydrazide provides further modification, for example to introduce a fluorophore.

         <title>Reversible Speed Regulation of Self&#8208;Propelled Janus Micromotors via Thermoresponsive Bottle&#8208;Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3262-3267, February 15, 2021. </description>

A robust and easily tunable micromotor platform is reported, based on Janus gated&#8208;mesoporous organosilica microparticles with reversible, external responsive braking systems using bottle&#8208;brush polyphosphazenes to control acceleration/deceleration by small changes in temperature.







Abstract
This work reports a reversible braking system for micromotors that can be controlled by small temperature changes (&#8776;5&#8201;&#176;C). To achieve this, gated&#8208;mesoporous organosilica microparticles are internally loaded with metal catalysts (to form the motor) and the exterior (partially) grafted with thermosensitive bottle&#8208;brush polyphosphazenes to form Janus particles. When placed in an aqueous solution of H2O2 (the fuel), rapid forward propulsion of the motors ensues due to decomposition of the fuel. Conformational changes of the polymers at defined temperatures regulate the bubble formation rate and thus act as brakes with considerable deceleration/acceleration observed. As the components can be easily varied, this represents a versatile, modular platform for the exogenous velocity control of micromotors.

         <title>Aerobic Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Salicylaldehydic Cformyl&#8722;H Arylations with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3278-3283, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids has been developed. It involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles, as well as high chemoselectivity for Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond based on copper catalysis.







Abstract
We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids that involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles. This protocol has high chemoselectivity for the Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperatures. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to the corresponding arylation products.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A challenging&lt;/b&gt; copper&#8208;catalyzed C&lt;sub&gt;formyl&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids has been developed. It involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles, as well as high chemoselectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;formyl&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond based on copper catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed C&lt;sub&gt;formyl&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids that involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles. This protocol has high chemoselectivity for the C&lt;sub&gt;formyl&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperatures. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to the corresponding arylation products. Mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;hydroxy group of the salicylaldehyde substrate triggers the formation of salicylaldehydic copper complexes through a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

Monoreduction: Fast reactions as radical processes (k often 103&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) have not been study in open&#8208;ended, dynamic hosts so far. Moreover, high selectivity is a true challenge due to their fast kinetic. The radical reduction of alkyl dihalides in new water&#8208;soluble host 1 using green reducing agents as trialkylsilanes is reported. Modest (15&#8211;45&#8201;%) to excellent conversion (&gt;94&#8201;%) and excellent selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) in mono&#8208;reduced product was observed, imitating the action of biological enzymes.







Abstract
Reduction of alkyl dihalide guests (2&#8211;5 and 7) with trialkylsilanes (R3SiH) was performed in water&#8208;soluble host 1 to investigate the effects of confinement on fast radical reactions (k&#8805;103&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). High selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) for mono&#8208;reduced products was observed for primary and secondary dihalide guests under mild conditions. The results highlight the importance of host&#8211;guest complexation rates to modulate the product selectivity in radical reactions.

         <title>Forty Years after the Discovery of Its Nucleolytic Activity: [Cu(phen)2]2+ Shows Unattended DNA Cleavage Activity upon Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 10, Page 3273-3277, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation by fluorination: By introducing fluorine&#8208;containing substituents in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands of a [Cu(phen)2]2+ complex, nucleolytic activity in the absence of classical, bioabundant external reducing agents is observed. Such an activity is unknown for the unsubstituted [Cu(phen)2]2+, the first and otherwise one of the most efficient artificial nucleases. Also, the cytotoxicity profiles of the new complexes were different&#8212;though less toxic, cancer cells were more harmed than healthy cells.







Abstract
[Cu(phen)2]2+ (phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) is the first and still one of the most efficient artificial nucleases. In general, when the phen ligand is modified, the nucleolytic activity of its CuII complex is significantly reduced. This is most likely due to higher steric bulk of such ligands and thus lower affinity to DNA. CuII complexes with phen ligands having fluorinated substituents (F, CF3, SF5, SCF3) surprisingly showed excellent DNA cleavage activity&#8212;in contrast to the unsubstituted [Cu(phen)2]2+&#8212;in the absence of the otherwise required classical, bioabundant external reducing agents like thiols or ascorbate. This nucleolytic activity correlates well with the half&#8208;wave potentials E1/2 of the complexes. Cancer cell studies show cytotoxic effects of all complexes with fluorinated ligands in the low &#956;m range, whereas they were less toxic towards healthy cells (fibroblasts).

Impossible object in the molecular world: a stereogenic figure&#8208;eight molecule, which exhibits remarkable CPL properties, is depicted in the cover image. Electrons confined to the rigid and twisted molecule contribute greatly to the amplification of CPL in the excited state. The widely delocalized electrons in the molecule are described as if they were cats walking across a mysterious impossible object in the world of M.&#8197;C. Escher. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Hasegawa, Y. Imai, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005320).

The discovery of new chemical species often reveals novel bonding modes, whose further development represents an urgent task on the interface between fundamental chemistry and materials science. This work reports the synthesis of a hexacoordinated antimony&#8208;centered dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+ and the determination of its solid&#8208;state structure. The picture illustrates that [(ppy)3Sb]2+ is unearthed from crystals of &#8216;stibnite&#8217;, which is a representative naturally occurring antimony ore.

         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives, based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1,254,838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the properties of MOF&#8208;808 via defect engineering and metal nanoparticle encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect engineering and metal&#8208;encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO  2  adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Co3O4/Carbon Heteroaerogels with Ultrahigh Capacitance via Polyethyleneimine Intercalation of Co2BIM4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework Co2BIM4 nanosheets&#8208;based Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC heteroaerogel is developed as a novel supercapacitor electrode through polyethyleneimine intercalation strategy, which shows ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2568&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, remarkable rate capability (1747&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1at a drastically increased current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance preservation of 92.7&#8201;% after 10000&#8201;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based supercapacitors have attracted intense concentration in recent years due to their regularly arranged porous and tunable pore sizes. However, the performance of the MOFs&#8208;derived supercapacitors is also low because of their poor electrical conductivity and rarely accessible active sites. In the present work, we developed a Co&#8208;MOF (namely Co2BIM4, BIM=benzimidazole) nanosheets derived Co3O4/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC) heteroaerogel as a novel supercapacitor electrode. The 3D Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC heteroaerogels were obtained by directly intercalating polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the interlayers of Co2BIM4 nanosheets and following by carbonizing the resulting Co2BIM4/PEI composite. The Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC electrode possessed 3D conductive framework with an overlapped hetero&#8208;interface and expanded interlayers, leading to fast and stable charge transfer/diffusion and an enhanced pseudocapacitance performance. Therefore, the Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC electrode showed ultrahigh capacitance of 2568&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 1747&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and excellent long cycling time with a capacitance preservation of 92.7&#8201;% following 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is very promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.

         <title>The Cascade Reactions of Indigo with Propargyl Substrates for Heterocyclic and Photophysical Diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cascade reactions of indigo with propargyl electrophiles was explored to prepare new, structurally diverse heterocycles. Through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, new synthetic pathways are uncovered with selected products further investigated via absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy to unravel photophysical phenomena.







Abstract
The synthesis of structurally diverse heterocycles for chemical space exploration was achieved via the cascade reactions of indigo with propargylic electrophiles. New pyrazinodiindolodione, naphthyridinedione, azepinodiindolone, oxazinoindolone and pyrrolodione products were prepared in one pot reactions by varying the leaving group (&#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, &#8208;OMs, &#8208;OTs) or propargyl terminal functionality (&#8208;H, &#8208;Me, &#8208;Ph, &#8208;Ar). Mechanistic and density functional theory studies revealed that the unsaturated propargyl moiety can behave as an electrophile when aromatic terminal substitutions are made, and therefore competes with leaving group substitution for new outcomes. Selected products from the cascade reactions were investigated for their absorption and fluorescence properties, including transient absorption spectroscopy. This revealed polarity dependent excited state relaxation pathways, fluorescence, and triplet formation, thus highlighting these reactions as a means to access diverse functional materials rapidly.

         <title>Cations and Anions of Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene and Reduction of a Dibenzo[a,e]pentalenophane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic character in a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) was observed upon chemical oxidation to the cation radical and dication and reduction to the anion radical, as found from solid&#8208;state structures. In a bent DBP&#8208;phane aromaticity could not be reached upon reduction, and stabilization though proton abstraction occurred.







Abstract
Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a non&#8208;alternant conjugated hydrocarbon with antiaromatic character and ambipolar electrochemical behavior. Upon both reduction and oxidation, it becomes aromatic. We herein study the chemical oxidation and reduction of a planar DBP derivative and a bent DBP&#8208;phane. The molecular structures of its planar dication, cation radical and anion radical in the solid state demonstrate the gained aromaticity through bond length equalization, which is supported by nucleus independent chemical shift&#8208;calculations. EPR spectra on the cation radical confirm the spin delocalization over the DBP framework. A similar delocalization was not possible in the reduced bent DBP&#8208;phane, which stabilized itself by proton abstraction from a solvent molecule upon reduction. This is the first report on structures of a DBP cation radical and dication in the solid state and of a reduced bent DBP derivative. Our study provides valuable insight into the charged species of DBP for its application as semiconductor.

         <title>A Robust Mesoporous Al2O3&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Catalyst for Abundant NOx Storage with Rational Design of Pt and Ba Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocomposite Ba/Pt@Al2O3 catalyst, showing abundant NOx storage property in spherical mesoporous Al2O3 particles, can be rationally designed through one&#8208;pot spray&#8208;drying of a precursor solution containing Pt species and amphiphilic organic molecules followed by impregnation of Ba species after full crystallization of the Al2O3 frameworks during calcination, which is applied for proposing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous catalysts based on synergetic catalytic effects at the nanometer scale.

         <title>Non&#8208;coordinated and Hydrogen Bonded Phenolate Anions as One&#8208;Electron Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superbasic tetraphosphazene is a thieving magpie on the hunt for the shiny proton. Phenols are readily deprotonated and the respective non&#8208;coordinated anions are formed in the presence of weakly Lewis&#8208;acidic phosphazenium counterions. Strongly nucleophilic non&#8208;coordinated phenolates excel as reducing agents for the generation of radical anion salts and for the activation of SF6. Their high Lewis&#8208;basicity is accompanied by a pronounced tendency for hydrogen bonding, which is perceptible in their chemical behavior. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Hoge et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005123).

         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reaction using alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as stable alkyl radical precursors has been reported. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals but also elusive methyl radicals could be generated using the present reaction system. The generated radicals were trapped by electron&#8208;deficient olefins bearing various functional groups to give the desired alkyl adducts. Theoretical calculations provide an insight on the facile generation of methyl radicals from methylsilicate bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Morofuji, N. Kano et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005300).

Ruby Red: Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed butadiene&#8208;mediated benzannulation enables the first synthesis of 3,10&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl)rubicene and its N&#8208;doped derivatives as well as preliminary studies on their photophysical properties. Unlike the parent rubicene and 3,10&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl)rubicene, which adopt classical herringbone&#8208;type packing motifs in the solid state, the N&#8208;doped congener 7&#8201;b displays columnar packing with an alternating co&#8208;facial arrangement of aromatic and heteroaromatic substructures.

         <title>Dipyrrinato&#8208;Iridium(III) Complexes for Application in Photodynamic Therapy and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination complexes of iridium(III) are potential candidates for photodynamic therapy. Phenylpyridyl&#8208; and Cp*&#8208;containing (dipyrrinato)iridium(III) complexes with a multitude of functional groups at the dipyrrin moieties were synthesized and the phototoxic activity of the complexes evaluated in tumor and bacterial cell assays. The Cp*&#8208;containing and glycosylated dipyrrinato&#8208;phenylpyridyl complexes are promising photoactive agents, as visualized in the cover design by Ella Marushchenko. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8197;O. Senge, A. Wiehe, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004776).

         <title>Biological and medical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, e.g. bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, e.g. against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and evaluation of novel ring&#8208;strained noncanonical amino acids for residue&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions in living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal reactions are ideally suited to selectively modify proteins in complex environments, even in vivo. Kinetics and product stability of these reactions are crucial parameters to evaluate their usefulness for specific applications. Strain promoted inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions (SPIEDAC) between tetrazines and strained alkenes or alkynes are particularly popular, as they allow ultrafast labeling inside cells. In combination with genetic code expansion (GCE)&#8212;a method that allows to site&#8208;specifically incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in vivo&#8212;these reactions enable residue&#8208;specific fluorophore attachment to proteins in living mammalian cells. Several SPIEDAC capable ncAAs have been presented and studied under diverse conditions, revealing different instabilities ranging from educt decomposition to product loss due to &#946;&#8208;elimination. To identify which compounds yield the best labeling inside living mammalian cells has frequently been difficult. In this study we present a) the synthesis of four new SPIEDAC reactive ncAAs that cannot undergo &#946;&#8208;elimination and b) a fluorescence flow cytometry based FRET&#8208;assay to measure reaction kinetics inside living cells. Our results, which at first sight can be seen conflicting with some other studies, capture GCE specific experimental conditions&#8212;such as long&#8208;term exposure of the ring&#8208;strained ncAA to living cells&#8212;that are not taken into account in other assays.</dc:description>

         <title>seco&#8208;Labdanes: A Study of Terpenoid Structural Diversity Resulting from Biosynthetic C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond cleavage in synthesis: This review examines the isolation, bioactivity, and total synthesis of seco&#8208;labdane diterpenoids&#8212;a class of diterpenoid arising from C&#8722;C bond cleavage events. In doing so, the importance of biosynthetic C&#8722;C bond cleavage to the generation of structural diversity is highlighted.







Abstract
The cleavage of a C&#8722;C bond is a complexity generating process, which complements oxidation and cyclisation events in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. This process leads to increased structural diversity in a cluster of related secondary metabolites by modification of the parent carbocyclic core. In this review, we highlight the diversifying effect of C&#8722;C bond cleavage by examining the literature related to seco&#8208;labdanes&#8212;a class of diterpenoids arising from such C&#8722;C bond cleavage events.

Sic et simpliciter: A one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;reaction approach, starting from commercially available reagents, is developed to access 5&#8208;amino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid esters, working under metal&#8208;free conditions and using benign solvents. The novel sequence affords, for the first time, this class of functionalized cyclic amidines, bearing three stereocenters, in good to high overall yield and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A novel three&#8208;step four&#8208;transformation approach to highly functionalized 5&#8208;amino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid esters, starting from commercially available phenylsulfonylacetonitrile, aldehydes, and N&#8208;(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert&#8208;butyl ester, was developed. The one&#8208;pot strategy delivered this class of amidines bearing, for the first time, three contiguous stereocenters, in good to high yield and diastereoselectivity. The entire sequence was carried out using diethyl carbonate and 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran as benign solvents, operating under metal&#8208;free conditions. The process could be conveniently scaled&#8208;up, and the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated.

         <title>Bifunctional Europium(III) and Niobium(V)&#8208;Containing Saponite Clays for the Simultaneous Optical Detection and Catalytic Oxidative Abatement of Blister Chemical Warfare Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbV/EuIII&#8208;containing saponite materials were successfully applied for the first time to the dual optical detection and catalytic oxidative abatement in water, at room temperature of (2&#8208;chloroethyl)ethyl sulfide (CEES), a simulant of the blister chemical warfare agent, sulfur mustard.







Abstract
For the first time, the co&#8208;presence in the saponite structure of luminescent EuIII and catalytic NbV metal sites was exploited for the simultaneous detection and catalytic abatement of sulfur&#8208;containing blister chemical warfare agents. Metal centers were introduced in structural positions of the saponite (in the interlayer space or inside the inorganic framework) following two different synthetic methodologies. The functionalized saponites were able to reveal the presence of a sulfur mustard simulant (2&#8208;chloroethyl)ethyl sulfide (CEES) after few seconds of contact time and more than 80&#8201;% of the substrate was catalytically decomposed after 24&#8197;h in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Homogeneous Reforming of Aqueous Ethylene Glycol to Glycolic Acid and Pure Hydrogen Catalyzed by Pincer&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes Capable of Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reforming of aqueous ethylene glycol to glycolic acid and hydrogen is described. A plausible reaction mechanism, involving metal&#8211;ligand cooperation is proposed and supported by stoichiometric reactions, NMR studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies.







Abstract
Glycolic acid is a useful and important &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid that has broad applications. Herein, the homogeneous ruthenium catalyzed reforming of aqueous ethylene glycol to generate glycolic acid as well as pure hydrogen gas, without concomitant CO2 emission, is reported. This approach provides a clean and sustainable direction to glycolic acid and hydrogen, based on inexpensive, readily available, and renewable ethylene glycol using 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst. In&#8208;depth mechanistic experimental and computational studies highlight key aspects of the PNNH&#8208;ligand framework involved in this transformation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Amphiphilic AABB Phthalocyanines: Nanostructures for Efficient Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic nanoparticles formed by self&#8208;assembly of binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked amphiphilic AABB ZnII phthalocyanines in water are explored as new models for the efficient delivery of photosensitizers to bacteria. Photo&#8208;inactivation studies show an unusually high activity of the nanoparticles in killing the Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine (pc)&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral ZnIIPcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents). They contain differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous media and have proved efficient in the photo&#8208;inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The average size of the nanoparticles was determined by substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a nonsubstituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than the octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PSs present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective at killing both types of strain, showing an outstanding photo&#8208;inactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli.

         <title>Tuning Tetrazole Photochemistry for Protein Ligation and Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazole&#8208;based photolabelling of antibodies for PET. Tuning the photophysical properties of di&#8208;aryl tetrazole scaffolds can induce a bathochromic shift in the photoactivation window that facilitates protein ligation at long wavelengths. Photoactivatable metal binding chelates functionalised with a tetrazole are developed for applications in light&#8208;induced photoradiolabelling of monoclonal antibodies for positron emission tomography.







Abstract
Photochemistry provides a wide range of alternative reagents that hold potential for use in bimolecular functionalisation of proteins. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of metal ion binding chelates derivatised with disubstituted tetrazoles for the photoradiochemical labelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The photophysical properties of tetrazoles featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395&#8197;nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and the aza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with 89Zr, 64Cu and 68Ga radionuclides. DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with 89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based binding assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable in vitro retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.

         <dc:description>
Shine on me! Photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reactions with alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as alkyl radical precursors are reported. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals, but also elusive methyl radicals, can be generated under the present reaction system. This radical generation process is investigated by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Herein, a photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reaction with alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as stable alkyl radical precursors has been reported. The alkylsilicates were prepared in one step from organometallic reagents. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals, but also elusive methyl radicals, could be generated by using the present reaction system. The generated radicals were trapped by electron&#8208;deficient olefins bearing various functional groups to give the desired alkyl adducts. The silicon byproduct can be recovered after the photoreaction. The radical generation process was investigated by theoretical calculations, which provided an insight into the facile generation of methyl radicals from methylsilicate bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands.

         <title>Fluorogenic squaraine dendrimers for background&#8208;free imaging of integrin receptors in cancer cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (~2,300,000 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (~25%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3 nM) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Activation with Intramolecular &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1&#8208;BR  2  &#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=N]&#8208;C  6  H  4  (  3  &#8208;  6  ) [BR  2  = BMes  2  (  3  ), BC  12  H  8  , (  4  ), BBN (  5  ), BBNO (  6  )] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis. These novel types of pre&#8208;organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an ortho&#8208;phenylene linker, are capable of activating H&#8208;H, C&#8208;H, N&#8208;H, O&#8208;H, Si&#8208;H, B&#8208;H and C=O bonds.  4  and  5  deprotonated terminal alkynes to form the zwitterionic borates 1&#8208;(RC&#8801;C&#8208;BR  2  )&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]&#8208;C  6  H  4  (R = Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH  2  and pyrrolidine, to generate the adducts 1&#8208;(R  2  HN&#8594;BR  2  )&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]&#8208;C  6  H  4  , where the N&#8208;H functionality is activated by intramolecular H&#8208;bond interactions. In addition,  5  was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H  2  CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise,  5  is capable of cleaving H  2  , HBPin and PhSiH  3  to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family.&#160; In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation&#160; of previously unrecognized sulfur tetra hydride ( C 4v &#8208;symmetric SH 4 ) from &#160;hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) on the ground state potential energy surface.&#160; The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH 4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF 4 ( C 2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. &#160;The distressed character of SH 4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH 4 ) n and mixed (SH 4 &#183;&#183;&#183;H 2 S) n composition. &#160;We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH 4 &#183;&#183;&#183;H 2 S) n &#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH 3 &#8221; stoichiometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing multiconfigurational states by spectroscopy:&#160;The cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS spectra of CeO2  and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with&#160;ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed&#160;spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the&#160;relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron&#160;occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO  2  and cerocene&#160;exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction&#160;configurational&#160;composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated&#160;GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements&#160;using peak areas&#160;(nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3&#8208;edge is&#160;rationalized from the perspective&#160;of the relaxed orbitals for the GS and core ESs. The&#160;states&#160;underlying the different peaks&#160;differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1  vs. 4f0  sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene&#160;spectral peaks is associated with&#160;4f2  sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in&#160;terms of Ce IV and III ONs, as long assumed, with Ce II states additionally appearing in the&#160;cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the&#160;accuracy of the conventional&#160;approach to determining  nf  &#160;from Ce L3&#8208;edge, imitations are highlighted in terms of the&#160;ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states.&#160;The need to determine the origins of  nf  &#160;by calculations&#160;is stressed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N  2  adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8208;0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH  3  production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Carbonylation of Amines to Oxalamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30 years ago which usually need the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. Herein, we describe the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light. Our new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that Pd(I) was formed and Pd(0) was the active species. Both nitrogen&#8208; and the intermediate acyl radical can be detected. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by gas GC.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Syngas Production over Defective ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient syngas production from CO2 photoreduction is achieved by S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets. The critical role of S vacancies in tuning catalysis activity and selectivity is emphasized.







Abstract
Photocatalytic syngas (CO and H2) production with CO2 as gas source not only ameliorates greenhouse effect, but also produces valuable chemical feedstocks. However, traditional photocatalytic systems require noble metal or suffers from low yield. Here, we demonstrate that S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets are an ideal photocatalyst to drive CO2 reduction into syngas. It is found that building S vacancies can endow ZnIn2S4 with stronger photoabsorption, efficient electron&#8211;hole separation, and larger CO2 adsorption, finally promoting both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The syngas yield of CO and H2 is therefore significantly increased. In contrast to pristine ZnIn2S4, the syngas yield over VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can be improved by roughly &#8776;4.73&#8197;times and the CO/H2 ratio is modified from 1:4.18 to 1:1. Total amount of syngas after 12&#8197;h photocatalysis is as high as 63.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 without use of any noble metals, which is even higher than those of traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts in the reported literatures. This work demonstrates the critical role of S vacancies in mediating catalytic activity and selectivity, and highlights the attractive ability of defective ZnIn2S4 for light&#8208;driven syngas production.

         <title>Intramolecular Pyridinium Oxide Cycloadditions: Systematic Study of Substitution, Diastereoselectivity, and Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular cycloaddition of pyridinium oxides was systematically studied. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction results from equatorial positioning of tether substituents. Regiochemistry results from minimization of syn&#8208;pentane interactions and eclipsing interactions. The cycloaddition reaction is stereospecific and reversible.







Abstract
Intramolecular pyridinium oxide cycloadditions form complex polycyclic nitrogenous architectures. The diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity of pyridinium oxide cycloadditions was systematically investigated for the first time using complex substrates. Predictably high levels of diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity are observed, which can be attributed to minimization of steric (syn&#8208;pentane) and torsional strain in the products. The reaction is reversible under the reaction conditions, and it is stereospecific with respect to the dipolarophile geometry.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;coordinated framework film&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors with AC line filtering performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymer frameworks (CPFs) have broad applications due to their excellent features, including stable structure, intrinsic porosity, etc. However, preparation of thin film CPFs for energy storage and conversion remains challenge because of poor compatibility between conductive substrates and CPFs and crucial condition for thin film preparation. In this work, a CPF film is prepared by the coordination of the anisotropic four&#8208;armed ligand and Cu(II) at liquid&#8208;liquid interface. Such film based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) is fabricated through high energy scribing and electrolytes soaking. As&#8208;fabricated MSCs display high volumetric specific capacitance of 121.45 F cm  &#8208;3  . Besides, the volumetric energy density of MSCs reaches 52.6 mWh cm  &#8208;3  , which exceeds the electrochemical performance of most reported CPF&#8208;based MSCs. Especially, the device exhibits alternating current (AC) line filtering performance (&#8208;84.2&#176; at 120 Hz) and a short resistance&#8208;capacitance constant of 0.08 ms. This work not only provides a new CPF for MSCs with AC line filtering performance but also paves the way for thin film CPFs preparation with versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of MOFs with CAU&#8209;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type framework of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,2,4,6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2, respectively are formed. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), while the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2_np. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Cyano &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alkanes by Light Mediated Single Electron Transfer between Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are traditionally prepared by the formal [2+1] addition of carbene or radical based C1 units to alkenes. In contrast, the one pot intermolecular cyclopropanation of alkanes by redox active C1 units has remained unrealised. Herein, we achieved this process simply by exposing &#946;&#8208;aryl propionitriles and C1 radical precursors (  N  &#8208;oxy esters) to base and blue light. The overall process is redox&#8208;neutral and a photocatalyst, whether metal&#8208; or organic&#8208;based, is not required. Our findings support that single electron transfer (SET) from the &#945;&#8208;cyano carbanion of the propionitrile to the  N  &#8208;oxy ester is facilitated by blue&#8208;light via their electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. The &#945;&#8208;cyano carbon radical thus formed can then lose a &#946;&#8208;proton to form a &#960;&#8208;resonance stabilised radical anion that preferentially couples at the benzylic &#946;&#8208;position with a decarboxylated C1 radical unit. This new transition metal&#8208;free chemistry tolerates both electron rich and electron deficient (hetero)aryl systems, even sulfide or alkene functionality, to afford a range of  cis  &#8208;aryl/cyano cyclopropanes bearing congested tetrasubsitituted quaternary carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable synthesis of porous SiFe@C composite with excellent lithium storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a novel porous SiFe@C composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including suitable ball milling, partial etching and carbon layer coating. The novel pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase and a uniform carbon layer (12~16 nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilize the SEI film and markedly enhance the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g&#8208;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30%. Meanwhile, it shows larger discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles at 2 and 4 A g&#8208;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a bright prospect for the commercial production of high lithium storage capacity silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling emissive properties by intramolecular hydrogen bonds: alkyl and aryl meso&#8208;substituted porphycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, fourfold  meso&#8208;  substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents this effect is small. To explain this difference, we synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208; substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208; and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl&#8208; derivatives. Analysis of structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of six porphycenes, combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations shows a clear correlation between the strength of intramolecular NH&#183;&#183;&#183;N H&#8208;bonds and the efficiency of radiationless depopulation of the lowest excited singlet state. This result leads to a model that postulates that delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. Finding of correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) forms the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produces an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA forms a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled AAA (MWAAA) NTs and NRs are formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way we demonstrate the controlled formation of MWAAA suprastructures in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allows to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipyrrinato&#8208;Iridium(III) Complexes for Application in Photodynamic Therapy and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic dipyrrinato iridium complexes were synthesized and evaluated for their phototoxic activity against tumor cells and bacteria, the Gram&#8208;positive germ S. aureus and the Gram&#8208;negative Germ P. aeruginosa. Specifically, glycosylated phenylpyridyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes showed a high phototoxic effect against cells and S. aureus. Certain cyclopentadienyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes exerted a high phototoxic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
The generation of bio&#8208;targetable photosensitizers is of utmost importance to the emerging field of photodynamic therapy and antimicrobial (photo&#8208;)therapy. A synthetic strategy is presented in which chelating dipyrrin moieties are used to enhance the known photoactivity of iridium(III) metal complexes. Formed complexes can thus be functionalized in a facile manner with a range of targeting groups at their chemically active reaction sites. Dipyrrins with N&#8208; and O&#8208;substituents afforded (dipy)iridium(III) complexes via complexation with the respective Cp*&#8208;iridium(III) and ppy&#8208;iridium(III) precursors (dipy=dipyrrinato, Cp*=pentamethyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridyl). Similarly, electron&#8208;deficient [IrIII(dipy)(ppy)2] complexes could be used for post&#8208;functionalization, forming alkenyl, alkynyl and glyco&#8208;appended iridium(III) complexes. The phototoxic activity of these complexes has been assessed in cellular and bacterial assays with and without light; the [IrIII(Cl)(Cp*)(dipy)] complexes and the glyco&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes showing particular promise as photomedicine candidates. Representative crystal structures of the complexes are also presented.

         <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with a Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: A&#8201;Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Hybrid photochromic materials: A simple and general method for fabricating photochromic complexes by decorating metal nitrates with a coplanar 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline moiety under the collaboration of electron&#8208;transfer and coordination&#8208;assembly strategies is reported.







Abstract
As a significant class of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have attracted widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities for generating other photoresponsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photoresponsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands plays a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most CHPMs have been built from photodeformable or photoresponsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and expensive, and this greatly restricts their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new families of CHPMs besides the existing CHPMs. Herein, a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs by decorating metal nitrate with a coplanar bipyridine moiety, namely 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), is reported. The resulting products exhibit photocoloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO3&#8722; species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of the coordination environment and central metal ion on the photochromism was also studied. This work demonstrates that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrates as &#960;&#8208;EDs with the collaboration of ET and coordination&#8208;assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.

         <title>Multidentate, V&#8208;Shaped Pyridine Building Blocks as Tectons for Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Build better! Four new, multidentate pyridine&#8208;based building blocks have been synthesised to be used as tectons in crystal engineering. They comprise a V&#8208;shaped scaffold functionalised with different moieties, namely bromine atoms, carboxylic groups, triple bonds and amine groups. This endows the tectons with distinct steric, electrostatic, and self&#8208;assembly properties, directing their solid&#8208;state structures via the formation of supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular structural units through self&#8208;assembly is a powerful method to design new architectures and materials endowed with specific properties. With the aim of adding a group of versatile tectons to the toolkit of crystal engineers, we have devised and synthesised four new V&#8208;shaped building blocks characterised by an aryl acetylene scaffold comprising three substituted pyridine rings connected by two triple bonds. The judicious choice of different substituents on the pyridine rings provides these tectons with distinctive steric, electrostatic and self&#8208;assembly properties, which influence their crystal structures and their ability to form co&#8208;crystals. Co&#8208;crystals of the tectons with tetraiododifluorobenzene were obtained both via traditional and mechanochemical crystallisation strategies, proving their potential use in crystal engineering. The energetic contributions of the supramolecular interactions at play in the crystal lattice have also been evaluated to better understand their nature and strength and to rationalise their role in designing molecular crystals.

         <title>2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[b]arsole: Structural Modification and Polymerization for Tuning of Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis and structural modification of 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[b]arsoles were performed by utilizing zirconacycles, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. In addition, main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain type polymers were synthesized, and the resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[b]arsoles were synthesized from zirconacycles and diiodophenylarsine. The structural modification to the luminophore was attained through diarylacetylene precursors, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. The emission properties were controlled according to these modifications. The 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[b]arsoles showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement; the stronger emission was observed in the solid states than in solutions. In addition, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycondensation and olefin metathesis polymerization produced main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain polymers, respectively. The resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis&#8217; 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (2005&#8211;2020), one of the most widely used N,N &#8209;bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups&#8212;and be able to remove them from their final products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208; t Bu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th(IV) compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8208; fragments. Therefore, although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(II) when reacted with Ph2E2 (E = S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Phase of N,N&#8208;Dimethylpyrrolidinium Iodide Impregnated into COFs Endows Fast Lithium Ion Conduction in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;state lithium electrolyte was fabricated by impregnating N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium iodide (P1,1I) into the pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The liquid&#8208;like phase of confined P1,1I in combination with the ordered nanochannels of COFs result in remarkable lithium ion conductivity and good cycling performance.







Abstract
A novel kind of solid&#8208;state lithium electrolyte was fabricated by impregnating organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) into the pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The liquid&#8208;like phase of confined N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium iodide (P1,1I) and the ordered nanochannels of COFs simultaneously stimulated the lithium ion conduction.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co&#8208;C)&#8208;Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo&#8208;structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR&#8208;spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of the Cob&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8208;Csp3)&#8208;BDE of Cob&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT&#8208;studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDE revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally&#8208;Hindered N&#8208; and S&#8208;Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by  ortho&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how  para&#8208; vs.  meta&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in  ET  of 0.24 eV in the different media &#8211; sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device &#8211; with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower  ET  values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high  ET  materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in selective oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8208;organic frameworks consisted of 8&#8208;connected Zr  6  &#8208;clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H  2  O  2  &#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. A significant predomination of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled to high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H  2  O  2  can also be realized, as evidenced by high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8208;organic frameworks consisted of 8&#8208;connected Zr  6  &#8208;clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H  2  O  2  &#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. A significant predomination of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled to high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H  2  O  2  can also be realized, as evidenced by high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. Low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H  2  O  2  &#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H  2  O  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Enabled One&#8208;Pot Multistep Synthesis of C19 Androgen Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of many valuable C19 androgens can be accomplished by removal of the C17 side chain from more abundant corticosteroids, followed by further derivatization of the resulting 17&#8208;keto derivative. Conventional chemical reagents pose significant drawbacks for this synthetic strategy, as large amounts of waste are generated, and quenching of the reaction mixture and purification of the 17&#8208;ketosteroid intermediate are typically required. Herein, we present mild, safe and sustainable electrochemical strategies for the preparation of C19 steroids. A reagent and catalyst free protocol for the removal of the C17 side&#8208;chain of corticosteroids via anodic oxidation has been developed, enabling several one&#8208;pot, multistep procedures for the synthesis of androgen steroids. In addition, simultaneous anodic C17 side&#8208;chain cleavage and cathodic catalytic hydrogenation of a steroid has been demonstrated, rendering a convenient and highly atom economic procedure for the synthesis of saturated androgens</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo . In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;coordinated and Hydrogen Bonded Phenolate Anions as One&#8208;Electron Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effect of hydrogen bonding on redox properties: The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with a tetraphosphazene base delivers non&#8208;coordinated phenolates with zinc&#8208;like redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which are capable in radical anion synthesis and SF6 activation. The addition of phenol or water allows for the selective formation of phenolate adducts and enables the study of the effect of hydrogen bonding on phenolate redox properties.







Abstract
In this work, the syntheses of non&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich phenolate anions via deprotonation of the corresponding alcohols with an extremely powerful perethyl tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) are reported. The application of uncharged phosphazenes renders the selective preparation of anionic phenol&#8208;phenolate and phenolate hydrates possible, which allows for the investigation of hydrogen bonding in these species. Hydrogen bonding brings about decreased redox potentials relative to the corresponding non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions. The latter show redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which is comparable to that of zinc metal, thus qualifying their application as organic zinc mimics. We utilized phenolates as reducing agents for the generation of radical anions in addition to the corresponding phenoxyl radicals. A tetracyanoethylene radical anion salt was synthesized and fully characterized as a representative example. We also present the activation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with phenolates in a SET reaction, in which the nature of the respective phenolate determines whether simple fluorides or pentafluorosulfanide ([SF5]&#8722;) salts are formed.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Addition of Diorganozinc Reagents to Pyrazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;Diones and Indoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diones</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric diorganozinc additions to cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones including pyrazolin&#8208;4,5&#8208;diones and indolin&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones are described. A wide range of highly functionalized chiral tertiary alcohols has been obtained in high to excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The success of this strategy relies on the multiple coordination of zinc aminoalkoxide species to cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones which contain two carbonyl groups.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective diorganozinc additions to cyclic diketones including pyrazolin&#8208;4,5&#8208;diones and isatins have been developed. In the presence of morpholine&#8208;containing chiral amino alcohol ligand, the corresponding chiral cyclic tertiary alcohols were produced in good to excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). The notable feature of this protocol includes its mild reaction conditions, Lewis acid additives free and broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Guided Antitumoural Drugs: (Imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)(L)gold(I) Complexes Seeking Cellular Targets Controlled by the Nature of Ligand L</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Striking gold: Through the choice of their secondary ligand L, a series of [4,5&#8208;diarylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes targeted different cancer cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria or lysosomes) where they interfered beneficially with molecular targets, such as DNA, thioredoxin reductase, or lysosomal membranes, to elicit p53&#8208;independent apoptosis. Such guided metallodrugs will help to minimise unwanted side effects by addressing limited arrays of targets.







Abstract
Three [1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes, 4&#8201;a (L=Cl), 5&#8201;a (L=PPh3), and 6&#8201;a (L=same N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)), and their fluorescent [4&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) analogues, 4&#8201;b, 5&#8201;b, and 6&#8201;b, respectively, were studied for their localisation and effects in cancer cells. Despite their identical NHC ligands, the last three accumulated in different compartments of melanoma cells, namely, the nucleus (4&#8201;b), mitochondria (5&#8201;b), or lysosomes (6&#8201;b). Ligand L was also more decisive for the site of accumulation than the NHC ligand because the couples 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 5&#8201;a/5&#8201;b, and 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, carrying different NHC ligands, afforded similar results in cytotoxicity tests, and tests on targets typically found at their sites of accumulation, such as DNA in nuclei, reactive oxygen species and thioredoxin reductase in mitochondria, and lysosomal membranes. Regardless of the site of accumulation, cancer cell apoptosis was eventually induced. The concept of guiding a bioactive complex fragment to a particular subcellular target by secondary ligand L could reduce unwanted side effects.

Ligand L was also more decisive for the site of accumulation than the NHC ligand because the couples &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;6&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, carrying different NHC ligands, afforded similar results in cytotoxicity tests, and tests on targets typically found at their sites of accumulation, such as DNA in nuclei, reactive oxygen species and thioredoxin reductase in mitochondria, and lysosomal membranes. Regardless of the site of accumulation, cancer cell apoptosis was eventually induced. The concept of guiding a bioactive complex fragment to a particular subcellular target by secondary ligand L could reduce unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Robust Mesoporous Al2O3&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Catalyst for Abundant NOx Storage with Rational Design of Pt and Ba Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Storing NOx: A rational example for the preparation of a nanocomposite catalyst showing improved NOx storage properties and originating from Ba species is demonstrated through the use of a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. Impregnation of Ba species can be completed successfully with retention of the mesoporous structure only after full crystallization of the Al2O3 framework to its &#947;&#8208;phase with the formation of Pt nanoparticles inside the Al2O3 particles.







Abstract
The nanostructural design of heterogeneous catalysts has often been demanded for assessing synergetic effects, which should be developed further by using high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous metal oxide supports. However, such opportunities have been undermined by the poor stability of ordered mesoporous structures. Herein, rational design is demonstrated to obtain nanocomposite catalysts showing improved NOx storage properties owing to the presence of Ba species over a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. It is found that Ba species are impregnated successfully only after the stabilization of the mesoporous structure by full crystallization of Al2O3 frameworks to the &#947;&#8208;phase, with the formation of Pt nanoparticles coinciding with complete removal of organic components. All the insights during this synthetic procedure are essential for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts to purify and recover NOx molecules, and are applied for designing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous nanocomposite catalysts.

         <title>Quantification of Noncovalent Interactions in Azide&#8211;Pnictogen, &#8211;Chalcogen, and &#8211;Halogen Contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions that bind: The noncovalent interactions between azides and oxygen&#8208;containing moieties are investigated through a computational study based on experimental findings. A set of 44 high&#8208;quality, gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8211;pnictogen, &#8211;chalcogen, and &#8211;halogen contacts are compiled and investigated through semiempirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations, and wave function theory.







Abstract
The noncovalent interactions between azides and oxygen&#8208;containing moieties are investigated through a computational study based on experimental findings. The targeted synthesis of organic compounds with close intramolecular azide&#8211;oxygen contacts yielded six new representatives, for which X&#8208;ray structures were determined. Two of those compounds were investigated with respect to their potential conformations in the gas phase and a possible significantly shorter azide&#8211;oxygen contact. Furthermore, a set of 44 high&#8208;quality, gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8211;pnictogen (N, P, As, Sb), &#8211;chalcogen (O, S, Se, Te), and &#8211;halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) contacts are compiled and investigated through semiempirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations, and wave function theory. A local energy decomposition (LED) analysis is applied to study the nature of the noncovalent interaction. The special role of electrostatic and London dispersion interactions is discussed in detail. London dispersion is identified as a dominant factor of the azide&#8211;donor interaction with mean London dispersion energy&#8208;interaction energy ratios of 1.3. Electrostatic contributions enhance the azide&#8211;donor coordination motif. The association energies range from &#8722;1.00 to &#8722;5.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Combined Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and C&#8722;H Functionalization for Facile Synthesis of Non&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;Atropisomer&#8208;Type Axially Chiral Organosilanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Powerful DKR: A palladium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ortho C&#8722;H olefination/alkynylaton combined with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is developed to construct axially chiral styrene&#8208;type organosilanes with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Although asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization has been available for the synthesis of structurally diverse molecules, catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to change racemic stereogenic axes remain synthetic challenges in this field. Here, a concise palladium&#8208;catalyzed DKR was combined with C&#8722;H functionalization involving olefination and alkynylation for the highly efficient synthesis of non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;atropisomer&#8208;type (NBA) axially chiral oragnosilanes. The chemistry proceeded through two different and distinct DKR: first, an atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o&#8242;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Deciphering the Chemical Basis of Fluorescence of a Selenium&#8208;Labeled Uracil Probe when Bound at the Bacterial Ribosomal A&#8208;Site</title>

Cause and effect: The fluorescence of SeU in the context of ribosomal RNA and in the presence of antibiotic paromomycin has been investigated by means of computational methods. Our results explain why the probe does not emit if antibiotics are not present and which factors are the most important to control fluorescence.







Abstract
We unveil in this work the main factors that govern the turn&#8208;on/off fluorescence of a Se&#8208;modified uracil probe at the ribosomal RNA A&#8208;site. Whereas the constraint into an &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; conformation of the two rings of the fluorophore is the main driver for the observed turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission in the presence of the antibiotic paromomycin, the electrostatics of the environment plays a minor role during the emission process. Our computational strategy clearly indicates that, in the absence of paromomycin, the probe prefers conformations that show a dark S1 electronic state with participation of n&#960;* electronic transition contributions between the selenium atom and the &#960;&#8208;system of the uracil moiety.

Novel C&#8208;N axial chiral iodoarenes enable catalytic stereoselective &#945;&#8208;oxytosylations of ketones with high yields and improved enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A simple synthesis of a library of novel C&#8722;N axially chiral iodoarenes is achieved in a three&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available aniline derivatives. C&#8722;N axial chiral iodine reagents are rarely investigated in the hypervalent iodine arena. The potential of the novel chiral iodoarenes as organocatalysts for stereoselective oxidative transformations is assessed using the well explored, but challenging stereoselective &#945;&#8208;oxytosylation of ketones. All investigated reagents catalyse the stereoselective oxidation of propiophenone to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;oxytosylated products with good stereochemical control. Using the optimised reaction conditions a wide range of products was obtained in generally good to excellent yields and with good enantioselectivities.

         <title>Mo2C/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity and Biocompatibility for Microbial Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial fuel cells: A unique porous nanocomposite Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide decorated on carbon paper is demonstrated as an advanced multifunction anode for microbial fuel cells. The hierarchical porous structure and rough surface of Mo2C granules are energetically in favor of the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and thus guarantee an admirable energy conversion efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the carbon paper.







Abstract
A simple, cost&#8208;effective strategy was developed to effectively improve the electron transfer efficiency as well as the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by decorating the commercial carbon paper (CP) anode with an advanced Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide (Mo2C/RGO) composite. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the superior electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C, the high surface area, and prominent conductivity of RGO, the MFC equipped with this Mo2C/RGO composite yielded a remarkable output power density of 1747&#177;37.6&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2, which was considerably higher than that of CP&#8208;MFC (926.8&#177;6.3&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2). Importantly, the composite also facilitated the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria&#8211;electrode interaction. These features resulted in an enhanced coulombic efficiency up 13.2&#8201;%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the CP (1.2&#8201;%).

         <title>Small Figure&#8208;Eight Luminophores: Double&#8208;Twisted Tethered Cyclic Binaphthyls Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped cyclic naphthalenes with different tethers were synthesized, and their CPL properties were investigated. Compounds with short tether showed remarkable boosting of the glum (0.010&#8211;0.016). The proximate figure&#8208;eight luminophore promotes elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum.







Abstract
Double&#8208;twisted cyclic binaphthyls, in which two naphthalenes are tethered by &#8208;O(CH2)nO&#8208; linkage (n=1&#8211;3), have been synthesized. X&#8208;ray analyses and DFT calculations revealed a tightly constrained stereogenic figure&#8208;eight geometry. Tethering of two naphthalenes by short linkage forces a small dihedral angle, and the cyclic binaphthyls with short tether (n=1, 2) exhibit remarkable boosting of the glum value (1.0&#8211;1.6&#215;10&#8722;2) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and unusual glum/gabs ratios (0.93&#8211;1.3). These experimental high |glum| values are in accord with the results of excited state TD&#8208;DFT calculations, which show transannular interactions and that consequent extensive delocalization occurs throughout the figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;core. As a result, the present figure&#8208;eight luminophore promote the elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum values.

         <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the dialuminum complex [{(MeIMes)PH}(AlMe3)2] was obtained for MeIMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. These complexes served as initiators for the efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide in toluene at 60 &#176;C. High degrees of isoselectivity were found for the poly(rac&#8208;lactide) obtained in the presence of the monoaluminum complexes (Pm up to 0.92, Tm up to 191 &#176;C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination&#8208;insertion mechanism with the carbene&#8208;phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the &#8211;OH Groups within Mn12 Clusters in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formidable reactivity of the oxygen&#8208;evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water&#8208;soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,5DHMn  12  &#8221;) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,4,5THMn  12  &#8221;) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein we explore the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalytic process by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new  Mn  12  clusters,  3,4DHMn  12  and  2,3DHMn  12  , having one &#8211;OH group in the  meta  position relative to the benzoate&#8208;Mn moiety, and one at the  para  or  ortho  position, respectively. We discovered that the Mn centers in  3,4DHMn  12  have lower oxidation potential compared with those in  2,3DHMn  12  , and thus,  3,4DHMn  12  can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than  2,3DHMn  12  . Hence, we could establish the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalysis, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formidable reactivity of the oxygen&#8208;evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water&#8208;soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,5DHMn  12  &#8221;) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,4,5THMn  12  &#8221;) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208; alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa&#8208;dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs&#8217; [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt heterojunction with boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8208;hole separation and immigration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by HRTEM. The photocatalytic H  2  evolution productivity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#956;molg  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , which is 16 times higher than that of SrTiO  3  /Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  /Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO  4  , which promotes the transfer and immigration of photogenerated carriers by forming heterojunction and the porous structure, which provides a large amounts of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H  2  release.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi&#8208;Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near&#8208;IR probe to unveil a rapid excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer&#8594;charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization and Coordination Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu(I) halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2a: X = Cl, 2b: X = Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex 1b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1a) and CuX (X = Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5a: X = Cl, n = 2.4; 5b: X = Br, n = 2.4; 5c: X = I, n = 0.95).

         <title>Polyampholytic Graft Copolymers as Matrix for TiO2/Eosin Y/[Mo3S13]2&#8208; Hybrid Materials and Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to enhance the performance of inorganic semiconductors is moving towards organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. Here, we report the design of core&#8208;shell hybrid materials based on a TiO  2  core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;  graft  &#8208;(n&#8208;propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  ). The PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO  2  core. This resulted in high visible light&#8208;driven H  2  generation. The enhanced light&#8208;driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core&#8208;shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  was possible by introducing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  cluster anions as hydrogen evolution&#8208;cocatalyst. This novel design approach is one example for a multi&#8208;component system where reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphs of the gadolinite&#8208;type borates ZrB2O5&#160;and HfB2O5&#160;under extreme pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the results from previous high&#8208;pressure experiments on the gadolinite&#8208;type mineral datolite,&#160;CaBSiO4(OH), the behavior of the isostructural borates &#946;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;and &#946;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;have been studied by synchrotron&#8208;based in situ high&#8208;pressure single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. On compression to 120 GPa, both borate layer&#8208;structures are preserved. Additionally, at ~114&#160;GPa, the formation of a second phase can be observed in both compounds. The new high&#8208;pressure modification&#160;&#947;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;features a rearrangement of the corner&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra, while still maintaining the four&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings. The new phase&#160;&#947;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;contains ten&#8208;membered rings including the rare structural motif of edge&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra with exceptionally short B&#8211;O and B&#183;&#183;&#183;B distances. For both structures, unusually high coordination numbers are found for the transition metal cations, with ninefold coordinated Hf4+, and tenfold coordinated Zr4+, respectively. These findings remarkably show the potential of cold compression as a low&#8208;energy pathway to discover metastable structures that exhibit new coordinations and structural motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Supramolecular Structural Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl and Tetrafluorosulfanylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of crystal structures of SF  5  &#8208; or SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules revealed that these groups are often surrounded by hydrogen or other fluorine atoms. Even though fluorine prefers F&#183;&#183;&#183;H over F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts, the latter appeared to be important in many compounds. In a significant number of datasets, the closest F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts are below 95% of the van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals distance of two F atoms. Moreover, a number of repeating structural motifs formed by contacts between SF  5  groups was identified, including different supramolecular dimers and infinite chains. Among SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules, the study focused on SF  4  Cl compounds, including the first solid&#8208;state structure analyses of these reactive species. Additionally, electrostatic potential surfaces of a series of Ph&#8208;SF  5  derivatives were calculated, pointing out the substituent influence on the ability of F&#183;&#183;&#183;X contact formation (X = F or other electronegative atom). Interaction energies were calculated for different dimeric arrangements of Ph&#8208;SF  5  , which were extracted from experimental crystal structure determinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence for Achiral Metal Organic Colloids and the Guest Molecules in Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, scientists have reported a bunch of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that could emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence that observed in the vortex stirring. The absolute values for  g  lum  are 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. Plus or minus of  g  lum  depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easily be manipulated. Further, host&#8208;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interaction and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from colloidal solution to guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yield and pretty well  g  lum  value in the colloidal solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Review The overview of N&#8208;rich antennae investigated in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discuss their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green light emitting NDI is yet to be established. Herein we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric &#8211;NH2 substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8208;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8211;NH2 substituted NDI (2) revealed quantum yield, &#1060;f of ~81% and ~68% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the &#1060;f by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the ESIPT process. Our synthetic protocol applies Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8211;NH2 group integration at NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonds in excited&#8208;state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as emerging fluorinated groups: synthesis under photoredox catalysis and determination of the lipophilicity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two&#8208;step strategy based on a metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88% which raised to 98% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physico&#8208;chemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>A Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive &#945;&#8208;Desulfonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A titanium(III)&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from&#160;&#945;&#8208;sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base&#8208;mediated&#160;&#945;&#8208;alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied to the&#160;&#945;&#8208;desulfonylation of ketones too.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A titanium(III)&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from&#160;&#945;&#8208;sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base&#8208;mediated&#160;&#945;&#8208;alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied to the&#160;&#945;&#8208;desulfonylation of ketones too. In addition, a one&#8208;pot desulfonylative alkylation is demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a catalyst&#8208;dependent mechanism involving a homolytic C&#8208;S cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Au  2  Fe, Ag  2  Fe and Cu  2  Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ], [Ag{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8242; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8242; in [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147  o  . The Fe(CO)  5  ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  . The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8242; fragments and  D  2  symmetry for the copper and silver cations and  D  4  d  symmetry for the gold cation.&#160; The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)  5  ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  show the order M = Au (  D  e  = 137.2 kcal/mol) &gt; Cu (  D  e  = 109.0 kcal/mol) &gt; Ag (  D  e  = 92.4 kcal/mol). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8208;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)  5  ]&#8594;M  +  &#8592;[Fe(CO)  5  ] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)  5  ]&#8592;M  +  &#8594;[Fe(CO)  5  ] backdonation.</dc:description>

         <title>The long and bright path of a lanthanide MOF: from the basics towards the application.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable, reliable, and low&#8208;cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non&#8208;trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. We chose cotton as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity, which together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb&#8208;BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. We identified crystalline phase changes that correlated to structural information. Finally, we used the Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response up to 10ppm and 0.8ppm detection limit making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8208;carbenium interaction present in these complexes.&#160; Here, we show that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9&#8208; N &#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au &#8211; Acr distance.&#160; Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O &#8211; carbenium interaction.&#160; These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.&#160; These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Metal&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Hydrogen Bonding Templates the Formation of a Highly Strained Covalent Organic Cage Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a&#160;  meta  &#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2&#8217;&#8208;position. Usually, a 120&#176; bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here we show that introduction of the benzoic acid group leads to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and&#160;  1  H,&#160;  13  C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen&#8208;bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a Re(I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength&#8208;selective ON/OFF ratio. The system we explore is a&#160;  fac  &#8208; [ Re(CO)  3  (TTF&#8208;DPPZ)Cl ] &#160;complexe, where TTF&#8208;DPPZ = 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[  i  ]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;  a  :2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;  c  ]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC&#8208;Stark spectroscopy confirm the presence of two distinct optically active charge&#8208;transfer processes, namely a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements show that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long&#8208;lived&#160;  3  MLCT state is observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remains as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp&#8208;H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various &#960; bonds. Recently we disclosed the first cases where SCBs reacted with both C  sp2  &#8208;H and C  sp3  &#8208;H &#963; bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, we report that SCB is also an efficient reagent for C  sp  &#8208;H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium catalysed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a C  sp  &#8208;Si functionality. Our preliminary studied suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of C  sp  &#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis &#8208;[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As).

         <title>Probing the local reaction environment during high turnover carbon dioxide reduction with Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electro&#173;chemical reactions that involve the production of OH &#8208; and the con&#173;sumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide re&#173;duction reaction (CO 2 RR) which together with the competing hydro&#173;gen evolution reaction exert changes in the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activi&#173;ty which in turn can possibly affect activity, stability and selectivity of the CO 2 RR. We determine the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activity in close proximity to a CO 2 converting Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt&#8208;nano&#173;sensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear&#173;force&#8208;based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves allowing to monitor changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt&#8208;tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#160;M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular  pcu  &#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer MOFs [Zn  2  (dicarboxylate)  2  (NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8729;  x  DMF&#8729;  y  H  2  O, where dicarboxylate  =  1,4&#8208;bdc (  1  ), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (  2  ), NH  2  &#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (  3  ), 2,6&#8208;ndc (  4  ), and bpdc (  5  ), have been engineering tailored. MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  feature two&#8208;fold degree of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1%, respectively. N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1&#8242;  &#8210;  5&#8242;  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. While  1&#8242;  and  3  &#8242;  &#8722;  5&#8242;  exhibited type I adsorption isotherms of CO  2  at 195 K,  2&#8242;  showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO  2  . Further,  3  &#8242;  also showed significant influence of amine functions in CO  2  uptake at high temperature due to the CO  2  &#8722;framework interactions. MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue light emissions in water suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26  &#956;  M, respectively, and the Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (  K  sv  ) of 2.93 &#215; 10  3  , 1.79 &#215; 10  3  , 3.78 &#215; 10  3  , 4.04 &#215; 10  3  , and 3.21 &#215; 10  3  M  &#8722;1  , respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@  3  , has provided direct evidences to ensure the binding sites, which show strong host&#8210;guest &#960;&#8210;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions for benefiting donor&#8211;acceptor electron&#8208;transfer to result in fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance, since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

The series of complexes has been characterized crystallographically, and electronic structures have been studied using, inter alia,  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry.

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal&#8208;Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC = 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC and MIL&#8208;53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large &#208; values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (pXRD), UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co&#8208;catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values.

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether&#8208;aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Not Carbon s&#8211;p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp. Our quantum&#8208;chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above&#8208;mentioned shortening in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of&#160; s &#8208;character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp.</dc:description>
