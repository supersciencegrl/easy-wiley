         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8208;organic cages and counterions regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We observed a unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) and external counter&#8208;anions in aqueous media. Behaving like many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures via counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering, and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counter&#8208;anions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Adaptive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Exclusive Recognition of p&#8208;Xylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of xylene isomers is one of the most important but most challenging and energy&#8208;intensive separation processes in the petrochemical industry. Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;28) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of p&#8208;xylene (pX) over its isomers of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and 1H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation from the as&#8208;synthesized HOF&#8208;28 to the pX exclusively included HOF&#8208;28&#201;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#183;&#183; &#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects of Tetracoordinate Boron in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present review focuses on recent examples of tetracoordinate boryl groups greatly influencing reactions in organic synthesis. Electron&#8208;rich tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, and interaction of the intermediates with carbon&#8211;boron or heteroatom&#8211;boron bonds is the origin of such substituent effects. Unique substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups often promote desired reactions and affect results of reactions such as yield and selectivity of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable excimer circularly polarized luminescence in isohexide derivatives from renewable resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10  &#8208;2  , which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Dynamic Covalent Architectures by Multivalence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous cleavage of multiple imine bonds is obviously more difficult than breaking a single one. Such enhanced stability results from multivalence.







Abstract
The formation of imine bond is reversible. This feature has been taken advantage of by chemists for accomplishing high yielding self&#8208;assembly. On the other hand, it also jeopardizes the intrinsic stability of these self&#8208;assembled products. However, some recent discoveries demonstrate that some of these imine bond containing molecules could be rather stable or kinetically inert. A deep investigation indicated that such enhanced stability results from, at least partially, multivalence. Such results also inspire chemists to use imine condensation for self&#8208;assembly in water, a solvent that is considered not compatible with imine bond for a long time.

         <title>4&#8208;Iodopyrimidine Labeling Reveals Nuclear Translocation and Nuclease Activity for Both MIF and MIF2**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein trafficking is an essential step for the functionalization of proteins. We report a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe 8 for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. This enabled monitoring of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation, which indicates a nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA. Thus, we provide a tool for MIF and MIF2 localization study, as well as demonstrate a nuclease activity for MIF2.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog MIF2 (also known as D&#8208;dopachrome tautomerase or DDT) play key roles in cell growth and immune responses. MIF and MIF2 expression is dysregulated in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate and convenient detection of MIF and MIF2 will facilitate research on their roles in cancer and other diseases. Herein, we report the development and application of a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe 8 for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. Probe 8 incorporates a fluorophore that allows in&#8197;situ imaging of these two proteins. This enabled visualization of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation of HeLa cells. This observation, combined with literature on nuclease activity for MIF, enabled the identification of nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Heck Carbonylation Reactions: Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Oxindole Ynones and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective domino Heck carbonylation reaction of o&#8208;iodoacrylanilides with phenylacetylenes or water has been developed using a Pd/(Cu) catalytic system containing a chiral diphosphine ligand L9, furnishing a wide array of chiral &#946;&#8208;carbonylated 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in high yields with up to 99&#8201;% ee values.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective domino Heck carbonylation reaction of o&#8208;iodoacrylanilides with terminal alkynes and water as the nucleophiles, affording a diversity of &#946;&#8208;carbonylated 2&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing a 3,3&#8208;disubstituted all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, in high yields (55&#8211;99&#8201;%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The synthetic utilities of the protocol were demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;derived ynone 3&#8201;ea and carboxylic acid 4&#8201;a, as well as the facile synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;oxindoles with a pyrazole or isoxazole moiety.

         <title>Elucidating the Supramolecular Copolymerization of N&#8208; and C&#8208;Centered Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamides: The Role of Parallel and Antiparallel Packing of Amide Groups in the Copolymer Microstructure</title>

Copolymerizing N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs in nonpolar solutions affords helical, H&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure. In contrast, in bulk, lamellar structures form and long&#8208;range order is lost. This is a result of the antiparallel H&#8208;bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs, which are less stable than the parallel H&#8208;bonds formed in the homopolymers.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) has been conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate the copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Based Approach to Reagent Selection for Oxidative Carbon&#8722;Hydrogen Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selecting the optimal reagent for an oxidative C&#8722;H cleavage reaction requires mechanistic understanding of these processes. This manuscript describes an experimental approach to identify the role of substrate oxidation potential, cation stability, and steric factors on reaction rates and yields with common oxidants. The results are explained through computational transition state energetic and geometric analyses.







Abstract
Numerous hydride&#8208;abstracting agents generate the same cationic intermediate, but substrate features such as intermediate cation stability, oxidation potential, and steric environment can influence reaction rates in an oxidant&#8208;dependent manner. This manuscript provides experimental data to illustrate the role that structural features play in the kinetics of hydride abstraction reactions with commonly used quinone&#8208;, oxoammonium ion&#8208;, and carbocation&#8208; based oxidants. Computational studies of the transition state structures and energies explain these results and energy decomposition analysis calculations reveal unique sensitivities to electrostatic attraction and steric repulsions. Rigorous rate studies of select reactions validated the capacity of the calculations to predict reactivity trends. Additionally, kinetics studies demonstrate the potential for product inhibition in DDQ&#8208;mediated reactions. These studies provide a clear guide to select the optimal oxidant for structurally disparate substrates and lead to predictions of reactivity that were validated experimentally.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of Helically Fused Anthraquinones with Unusually Close Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three anthraquinone units are angularly fused to construct a helical structure with sterically congested carbonyl groups, which influence structure, dynamic behavior, and spectroscopic and electrochemical properties relative to those of the anthracene analogs. The unusually close CO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;CO contacts (2.47&#8197;&#197;) are discussed in terms of noncovalent interactions based on theoretical approaches.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ketones consisting of three fused anthraquinone units were synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding fused anthracenes. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that these compounds had nonplanar helical structures with unusual contacts, C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O 2.467&#8197;&#197;, between the inner carbonyl groups. The role of n&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature 1H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron&#8208;deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Terminal vs. Fluorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Allenamides via Addition of Diazo Compounds to Terminal Ynamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuI&#8208;catalyzed robust synthesis of N&#8208;allenamides from ynamides by the reaction with various diazo&#8208;compounds was developed. DFT calculations showed that this transformation relies on an uncommon, reversed mechanism that, regardless of the polarization of the ynamide, favors the addition of the diazo compound at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide. The protocol tolerates a wide range of functional groups. This copper&#8208;catalyzed process represents the first synthesis of tri&#8208;, di&#8208; or per&#8208;fluorinated N&#8208;allenamides from ynamides.

A copper&#8208;mediated coupling reaction between ynamides and diazo&#8208;compounds to produce N&#8208;allenamides is reported for the first time. This method enables facile and rapid access to terminal N&#8208;allenamides by using commercially available TMS&#8208;diazomethane with wide functional group compatibility on the nitrogen. Furthermore, the ubiquity of molecules containing a fluorine moiety in medicine, in agricultural, and material science requires the continuous search of new building blocks, including this unique surrogate. The CuI/diazo protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;substituted N&#8208;allenamides. DFT calculations provided insights in the mechanism involved.

     alt="Copper-Catalyzed Synthesis of Terminal vs. Fluorine-Substituted N-Allenamides via Addition of Diazo Compounds to Terminal Ynamides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A CuI-catalyzed robust synthesis&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-allenamides from ynamides by the reaction with various diazo-compounds was developed. DFT calculations showed that this transformation relies on an uncommon, reversed mechanism that, regardless of the polarization of the ynamide, favors the addition of the diazo compound at the &#946;-position of the ynamide. The protocol tolerates a wide range of functional groups. This copper-catalyzed process represents the first synthesis of tri-, di- or per-fluorinated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-allenamides from ynamides.

The nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx exhibited prominent &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; cascaded catalytic enzyme activities including catalase, peroxidase, glutathione oxidase and glucose oxidase. The ingenious Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could significantly induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor regions; this results in a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; enzyme cascade that is lethal to cervical cancer. All in all, Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx can act as a high&#8208;performance and safe bioactive material for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of the reproductive system, seriously threatens women&#8216;s life and health, and is difficult to be cured by traditional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed a &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, Cu2&#8208;xSe with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H2O2 in cancer cells into O2. Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose with the assistance of O2; this not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H2O2 to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic .OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu2&#8208;xSe. Moreover, although the free&#8208;radical scavenger glutathione (GSH) is overexpressed in tumor cells, Cu2&#8208;xSe with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could induce significant ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, thus providing a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>

Competition rules! &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#8208;germylated phosphorus ylides of the general formula R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 bearing one chloride substituent on the group 14 element were synthesized and fully characterized. Chloride abstraction reactions provided access to dimeric or monomeric cations featuring a high fluoride ion affinity despite the relatively strong Cylide&#8722;E interaction with high double bond character.







Abstract
The synthesis and full characterization of &#945;&#8208;silylated (&#945;&#8208;SiCPs; 1&#8211;7) and &#945;&#8208;germylated (&#945;&#8208;GeCPs; 11&#8211;13) phosphorus ylides bearing one chloride substituent R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 (R=Ph; R1=Me, Et, Ph; R2=Me, Et, iPr, Mes; E=Si, Ge) is presented. The molecular structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The title compounds were applied in halide abstraction studies in order to access cationic species. The reaction of Ph3PC(Me)Si(Cl)Me2 (1) with Na[B(C6F5)4] furnished the dimeric phosphonium&#8208;like dication [Ph3PC(Me)SiMe2]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (8). The highly reactive, mesityl&#8208; or iPr&#8208;substituted cationic species [Ph3PC(Me)SiMes2][B(C6F5)4] (9) and [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) could be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Carrying out the halide abstraction reaction in the sterically demanding ether iPr2O afforded the protonated &#945;&#8208;SiCP [Ph3PCH(Et)Si(Cl)iPr2][B(C6F5)4] (6&#8201;dec) by sodium&#8208;mediated basic ether decomposition, whereas successfully synthesized [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) readily cleaves the F&#8722;C bond in fluorobenzene. Thus, the ambiphilic character of &#945;&#8208;SiCPs is clearly demonstrated. The less reactive germanium analogue [Ph3PC(Me)GeMes2][B{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}4] (14) was obtained by treating 11 with Na[B{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}4] and fully characterized including by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Structural parameters indicate a strong CYlide&#8722;Ge interaction with high double bond character, and consequently the C&#8722;E (E=Si, Ge) bonds in 9, 10 and 14 were analyzed with NBO and AIM methods.

         <title>Exploring the Influence of Intermolecular Interactions in Prebiotic Chemistry Using Laser Spectroscopy and Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the synergy between laser spectroscopy and calculations, the interaction potential energy surfaces of the dimers between adenine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine with theobromine have been explored. Both systems form stable aggregates with two strong hydrogen bonds, with binding energy values resembling the Watson&#8208;Crick analogue interactions. An energetic comparison suggests how intermolecular interactions influenced the evolutionary sequence.







Abstract
One of the most fascinating questions in chemistry is why nature chose CGAT as the alphabet of life. Very likely, such selection was the result of multiple factors and a long period of refinement. Here, we explore how the intermolecular interactions influenced such process, by characterizing the formation of dimers between adenine, theobromine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine. Using a combination of mass&#8208;resolved excitation spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we determined the structure of adenine&#8208;theobromine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;theobromine dimers. The binding energy of these dimers is very close to the canonical adenine&#8208;thymine nucleobases. Likewise, the dimers are able to adopt Watson&#8208;Crick conformations. These findings seem to indicate that there were many options available to build the first versions of the informational polymers, which also had to compete with other molecules, such as 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine, which does not have a valid attaching point for a saccharide. For some reason, nature did not select the most strongly&#8208;bonded partners or if it did, such proto&#8208;bases were later replaced by the nowadays canonical CGAT.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploiting the&lt;/b&gt; synergy between laser spectroscopy and calculations, the interaction potential energy surfaces of the dimers between adenine and 4-aminopyrimidine with theobromine have been explored. Both systems form stable aggregates with two strong hydrogen bonds, with binding energy values resembling the Watson-Crick analogue interactions. An energetic comparison suggests how intermolecular interactions influenced the evolutionary sequence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating questions in chemistry is why nature chose CGAT as the alphabet of life. Very likely, such selection was the result of multiple factors and a long period of refinement. Here, we explore how the intermolecular interactions influenced such process, by characterizing the formation of dimers between adenine, theobromine and 4-aminopyrimidine. Using a combination of mass-resolved excitation spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we determined the structure of adenine-theobromine and 4-aminopyrimidine-theobromine dimers. The binding energy of these dimers is very close to the canonical adenine-thymine nucleobases. Likewise, the dimers are able to adopt Watson-Crick conformations. These findings seem to indicate that there were many options available to build the first versions of the informational polymers, which also had to compete with other molecules, such as 4-aminopyrimidine, which does not have a valid attaching point for a saccharide. For some reason, nature did not select the most strongly-bonded partners or if it did, such proto-bases were later replaced by the nowadays canonical CGAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
In recent years, owing to the demand for high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based host materials, i.&#8201;e., im&#8208;CzP, im&#8208;CzPCz, im&#8208;CzPtBu, and im&#8208;OCzP, were synthesized to obtain high&#8208;efficiency green and red&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs. With im&#8208;OCzP as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 93.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 14.1&#8201;% (9.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 10.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis&#8208;4,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;3&#8208;pyridylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co&#8208;hosted system. The efficiency of im&#8208;OCzP combined with B3PyMPM forming co&#8208;hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 98.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 16.5&#8201;% (10.2&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 13.4&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively. These results exhibited that the proposed bipolar hosts have great flexibility in adjusting the carrier balance of EML in OLEDs, demonstrating their ingenious design and high potential.

Rhodium&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes has been established by using sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly electrocatalytic approaches. As a result, several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids were selectively methylated. Finally, an example of an unprecedented, paired electrolysis approach leading to ethylated and propylated arenes was also discovered.







Abstract
The use of electricity over traditional stoichiometric oxidants is a promising strategy for sustainable molecular assembly. Herein, we describe the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activation/alkylation of several N&#8208;heteroarenes. This catalytic approach has been successfully applied to several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids. The versatile C&#8722;H alkylation featured water as a co&#8208;solvent and user&#8208;friendly trifluoroborates as alkylating agents. Finally, the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalysis with unsaturated organotrifluoroborates proceeded by paired electrolysis.

Who&#8242;s first? Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site.

Abstract
Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site, in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most electron&#8208;deficient radical site. Abstraction of one or two H atoms and formation of an ion that formally corresponds to a combination of the ion and cyclohexane accompanied by elimination of a H atom (&#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221;) were observed. In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is intrinsically less reactive than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the first H atom abstraction either dissociates to give the H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product sometimes adds to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221; products. Similar reaction efficiencies were measured for three of the triradicals as for relevant monoradicals. Surprisingly, the remaining three triradicals (all containing a meta&#8208;pyridyne moiety) reacted substantially faster than the relevant monoradicals. This is likely due to the exothermic generation of a meta&#8208;pyridyne analog that has enough energy to attain the dehydrocarbon atom separation common for H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction transition states of protonated meta&#8208;pyridynes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolone as new type of selective lithium receptors were synthesized. The bi&#8208; and trinuclear lithium complexes relying on co&#8208;ligands (TBPO, TBP and TOPO) are reported for the first time. The unexpected aggregation conversion (from tri&#8208; to binuclear) in different TOPO equiv. was monitored by 31P, 1H and 7Li NMR. High extraction power and selectivity for Li+ at pH &#8764;8.2 show promising application in Li+ recognition and separation.







Abstract
Effective receptors for the separation of Li+ from a mixture with other alkali metal ions under mild conditions remains an important challenge that could benefit from new approaches. In this study, it is demonstrated that the 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones, HL2&#8208;HL4, in the presence of the typical industrial organophosphorus co&#8208;ligands tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), tributylphosphate (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), are able to selectively recognise and extract lithium ions from aqueous solution. Structural investigations in solution as well as in the solid state reveal the existence of a series of multinuclear Li+ complexes that include dimers (TBPO, TBP) as well as rarely observed trimers (TOPO) and represent the first clear evidence for the synergistic role of the co&#8208;ligands in the extraction process. Our findings are supported by detailed NMR, MS and extraction studies. Liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in the presence of TOPO revealed an unprecedented high Li+ extraction efficiency (78&#8201;%) for HL4 compared to the use of the industrially employed acylpyrazolone HL1 (15&#8201;%) and benzoyl&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroacetone (52&#8201;%) extractants. In addition, a high selectivity for Li+ over Na+, K+ and Cs+ under mild conditions (pH &#8764;8.2) confirms that HL2&#8208;HL4 represent a new class of ligands that are very effective extractants for use in lithium separation.

Aryl nitriles from oxazolines: We report a new method for for preparing highly functionalized tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;substituted aromatic nitriles by using two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with a broad range of electrophiles followed by an efficient conversion of the oxazolyl&#8208;directing group to a nitrile function by using oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h).







Abstract
A selective ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;functionalization of readily available aryl oxazolines by two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with electrophiles, such as (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides, iodine, tosyl cyanide, ethyl cyanoformate or allylic bromides (39 examples, 62&#8211;99&#8201;% yield) is reported. Treatment of these aryl oxazolines with excess oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h) provided the corresponding nitriles (36 examples, 73&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). Conversions of these nitriles to valuable heterocycles are reported, and a tentative mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence for Catalytic Stereoselective Semireduction of Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, ligand controlled regiodivergent semireduction of allenamides has been developed. This phosphine ligand&#8208;switched semireduction system has enabled an easy access to a broad scope of allylic and vinylic amides by using a single palladium catalyst. The excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of the divergent processes were achieved by the employment of monodentate Xphos and bidentate BINAP ligands (see scheme).







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence has been developed for catalytic semireduction of allenamides with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereocontrol. This system also provides an example of catalytic regiodivergent semireduction of allenes for the first time. The divergence of the semireduction is enabled by ligand switch with the same palladium pre&#8208;catalyst under operationally simple and mild conditions. Monodentate ligand XPhos exclusively promotes selective 1,2&#8208;semireduction to afford allylic amides, while bidentate ligand BINAP completely switched the regioselectivity to 2,3&#8208;semireduction, producing (E)&#8208;enamide derivatives.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative C&#8722;H Silylation of Alkynylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking silanes: Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sp C&#8722;H silylation by a dehydrogenative coupling between silylacetylenes and hydrosilanes is reported. As a result, a variety of complex organosilicon derivatives was obtained. An inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalyst can be used due to the dual role of phenylsilane as substrate and activator.







Abstract
Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes through dehydrogenative coupling of alkynylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones, were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure. Thirty&#8208;seven compounds were synthesized for the first time by applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalization (e.&#8201;g., hydrosilylation). The use of primary silanes as substrates and precatalyst activators permits the use of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal precatalysts, and avoids the presence of additional activators.

         <title>Merging of a Perylene Moiety Enables a RuII Photosensitizer with Long&#8208;Lived Excited States and the Efficient Production of Singlet Oxygen</title>

With perylene we can: The incorporation of an additional perylene dye enables the creation of a novel multichromophoric RuII photosensitizer that exhibits a strong absorptivity in the visible as well as a unique excited&#8208;state behavior. Moreover, this complex was found to efficiently generate singlet oxygen upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Multichromophoric systems based on a RuII polypyridine moiety containing an additional organic chromophore are of increasing interest with respect to different light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel RuII photosensitizer, namely [(tbbpy)2Ru((2&#8208;(perylen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthrolline))](PF6)2 RuipPer, that includes a merged perylene dye in the back of the ip ligand. This complex features two emissive excited states as well as a long&#8208;lived (8&#8197;&#956;s) dark state in acetonitrile solution. Compared to prototype [(bpy)3Ru]2+&#8208;like complexes, a strongly altered absorption (&#1013;=50.3&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 467&#8197;nm) and emission behavior caused by the introduction of the perylene unit is found. A combination of spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy was used to elucidate the nature of the excited states. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully used for the efficient formation of reactive singlet oxygen.

Here, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; photosensitizer, namely [(tbbpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru((2-(perylen-3-yl)-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazo[4,5-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;][1,10]-phenanthrolline))](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RuipPer&lt;/b&gt;, that includes a merged perylene dye in the back of the &lt;b&gt;ip&lt;/b&gt; ligand. This complex features two emissive excited states as well as a long-lived (8&#8197;&#956;s) dark state in acetonitrile solution. Compared to prototype [(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ru]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-like complexes, a strongly altered absorption (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;=50.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 467&#8197;nm) and emission behavior caused by the introduction of the perylene unit is found. A combination of spectro-electrochemistry and time-resolved spectroscopy was used to elucidate the nature of the excited states. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully used for the efficient formation of reactive singlet oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy&#8208;related applications. It mainly covers the strategies for preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, three typical electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures (curled surface, onion&#8208;like structure, and spiral structure), and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities. For more information, see the Minireview by Zheng et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;&gt;21.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives with robust adhesion behaviours have been designed by genetic engineering. Elastin&#8208;like polypeptides, mussel&#8208;foot proteins, and spider silk spidroin are employed to fabricate the bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives. The excellent biocompatibility and mechanical performance endow these bioadhesives for biomedical applications. To learn more, see the Minireview by F. Wang, K. Liu et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;35.

         <dc:description>
Two are better than one: In a joint study, groups in two laboratories at TU Braunschweig and Ulm University present a novel bichromophoric RuII complex. This unique photosensitizer was obtained by fusing a ruthenium polypyridine chromophore with an additional perylene dye. This photosensitizer exhibits a strong absorptivity in the visible region and an enhanced excited state lifetime of 8&#8197;&#956;s. In addition, this complex enables the efficient production of singlet oxygen. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Rau, S. Tschierlei, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103609).

Uranium&#8212;selenoether linkages have been accessed for the first time, enabling the study of U&#8722;SeR2 versus U&#8722;SR2 and U&#8722;OR2 bonding. The shape of the uranium selenoether complex resembles a butterfly, and the cover art depicts a metamorphosis from the protio&#8208;ligand (caterpillar), to the potassium salt of the ligand (chrysalis), to the uranium complex (butterfly). More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;J.&#8197;H. Emslie et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103580). Cover design: N.A.G.G.

Competition for the lone pair: Our paper describes efforts to access cationic &#945;&#8208;silylated (and &#945;&#8208;germylated) phosphorus ylides of the general formula [R3PC(R)SiR2]+. One inherent feature of these molecules is that the silyl and phosphonyl entities compete for the lone pair of electrons. The ambivalent nature of the possible resonance structures is reflected in the coloured segmentation of the cover feature. The two &#8220;competitors&#8221; are illustrated as sportspersons, and both resonance structures are represented depending on where the ball of positive change is. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Breher et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103974).

         <title>Bioengineered Protein&#8208;based Adhesives for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature, many bioengineered proteins have been designed and expressed to fabricate protein&#8208;based bioadhesives, including elastin&#8208;like polypeptides, mussel&#8208;foot proteins, and spider silk spidroin. In this context, the fabrication and adhesion performance of bioengineered protein&#8208;based bioadhesives are summarized. In particular, the biomedical applications of such protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented in each section. Perspectives and challenges of bioengineered protein&#8208;based bioadhesives are also highlighted.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based adhesives with their robust adhesion performance and excellent biocompatibility have been extensively explored over years. In particular, the unique adhesion behaviours of mussel and sandcastle worm inspired the development of synthetic adhesives. However, the chemical synthesized adhesives often demonstrate weak underwater adhesion performance and poor biocompatibility/biodegradability, limiting their further biomedical applications. In sharp contrast, genetically engineering endows the protein&#8208;based adhesives the ability to maintain underwater adhesion property as well as biocompatibility/biodegradability. Herein, we outline recent advances in the design and development of protein&#8208;based adhesives by genetic engineering. We summarize the fabrication and adhesion performance of elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;based adhesives, followed by mussel foot protein (mfp) based adhesives and other sources protein&#8208;based adhesives, such as, spider silk spidroin and suckerin. In addition, the biomedical applications of these bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented. Finally, we give a brief summary and perspective on the future development of bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives.

         <title>The Role of Surface Curvature in Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for their catalytic performance. This Minireview summarizes the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy&#8208;related applications, including the preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, the applications of these electrocatalysts in HER, OER, ORR, and CO2 RR, and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.







Abstract
Excessive consumption of fossil fuels has caused unavoidable environmental problems. The development of renewable and clean alternatives is essential for the sustainable and green development of human society. Electrocatalysts are most important parts in these energy&#8208;related devices. Recently, scientists found that the surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for the improvement of catalytic performance and the optimization of intrinsic catalytic activity during electrocatalytic process. The role of surface curvature in electrocatalysts is still under investigating. In this minireview, we summarized the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy&#8208;related applications. This review mainly involves the strategies for preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, three typical electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures (curled surface, onion&#8208;like structure, and spiral structure), and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.

         <title>Formation of Stable NiIII N&#8208;Confused Porphyrins Aided by a 3&#8208;Ethoxy Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, structures and reactivities of two stable NiIII N&#8208;confused porphyrin complexes 4 and 5 are reported. They were synthesized by oxidation of a NiII intermediate 3 and characterized by MS, UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy. The structures of 4 and 5 were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effects of the 3&#8208;ethoxy substitute and the reactivities of 4 and 5 were investigated.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivities of two stable NiIII N&#8208;confused porphyrin (NCP) complexes. Metalation of 3&#8208;OEt NCP 1 with NiCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O in CHCl3/EtOH gave 3&#8208;OEt NiII NCP 3 initially, which was easily oxidized in air to form the NiIII complex of NCP inner C&#8208;oxide 4. Bis&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;modified NiIII complex 5 was synthesized by oxidation of 3 with PIFA in ethanol and CHCl3. The structures of 4 and 5 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. An unusually long NiIII&#8722;C bond (2.170(9) &#197;) was observed in 4. The g&#8208;factor (g&gt;2.1) observed in the EPR spectra of 4 and 5 further confirmed that they are paramagnetic NiIII complexes. Comparative experiments showed that the 3&#8208;ethoxy group plays an important role in the formation of 4 and 5. Reduction of 4 and 5 with NaBH4 regenerated complex 3.

         <title>Uranium(IV) Thio&#8208; and Selenoether Complexes: Syntheses, Structures, and Computational Investigation of U&#8722;ER2 Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinide&#8211;soft donor linkages are of importance in the context of lanthanide&#8208;actinide separation. The first example of a uranium selenoether complex has been prepared through the use of a rigid SeNSe&#8208;donor pincer ligand. The thioether analogue was also synthesized. Computational studies, including NBO, AIM and ELF calculations, revealed increasing covalency in U&#8722;ER2 bonding from O to S to Se.







Abstract
Rigid thioether&#8208; and selenoether&#8208;containing pincer proligands H[AS2
] (1) and H[ASe2

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actinide&#8211;soft donor&lt;/b&gt; linkages are of importance in the context of lanthanide-actinide separation. The first example of a uranium selenoether complex has been prepared through the use of a rigid SeNSe-donor pincer ligand. The thioether analogue was also synthesized. Computational studies, including NBO, AIM and ELF calculations, revealed increasing covalency in U&#8722;ER&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bonding from O to S to Se.

         <title>Expedient Access to Cyanated N&#8208;Heterocycles by Direct Flow&#8208;Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable C(sp2)&#8722;H electrocyanation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. The protocol employs nBu4NCN as cyanide source and is performed in an undivided cell making it amenable to both batch and flow set&#8208;ups. A total of 44 examples were synthesized in batch and 14 in flow, including privileged drug&#8208;like heterocycles, such as pyrroles, imidazoles, (aza)indoles, and indazoles. The method displays high functional&#8208;group tolerance and, for the first time, allows to directly cyanate unprotected N&#8722;H indoles.







Abstract
Nitriles are recurring motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile functional groups in synthetic chemistry. Despite recent progress, direct introduction of a nitrile moiety in heteroarenes remains challenging. Recent developments in electrochemical reactions pave the way to more practical cyanation protocols. However, currently available methods typically require hazardous cyanide sources, expensive mediators, and often suffer from narrow substrate scope and laborious reaction set&#8208;up. To address the limitations of current synthetic methods, herein, an effective, sustainable, and scalable procedure for the direct C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles with a user&#8208;friendly flow&#8208;electrochemical set&#8208;up is reported. Furthermore, high substrate and functional&#8208;group tolerance is demonstrated, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug&#8208;like scaffolds, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Methane Activation by (MoO3)5O&#8722; Cluster Anions: The Importance of Orbital Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;H activation of CH4 by the bridging oxygen radical (Ob.&#8722;) over molybdenum oxide cluster anions has been experimentally identified under thermal collision conditions. The empty 2p orbital of Ob.&#8722; is perpendicular to the surface of (MoO3)5O&#8722; cluster that is superior to the (MoO3)6O&#8722; cluster that contains a Ob.&#8722; radical with the empty 2p orbital being parallel to the cluster surface.







Abstract
The reactivity of the molybdenum oxide cluster anion (MoO3)5O&#8722;, bearing an unpaired electron at a bridging oxygen atom (Ob.&#8722;), towards methane under thermal collision conditions has been studied by mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations. This reaction follows the mechanism of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and is facilitated by the Ob.&#8722; radical center. The reactivity of (MoO3)5O&#8722; can be traced back to the appropriate orientation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) that is essentially the 2p orbital of the Ob.&#8722; atom. This study not only makes up the blank of thermal methane activation by the Ob.&#8722; radical on negatively charged clusters but also yields new insights into methane activation by the atomic oxygen radical anions.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective C7 Functionalisation of Indolines and Indoles</title>

The first enantioselective synthesis of C7&#8208;indolino&#8208; and C7&#8208;indolo&#8208;biaryl atropisomers by means of C&#8722;H functionalisation catalysed by our chiral rhodium complex (RhJasCp) is reported. The reaction works for a wide range of substrates and gives excellent yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and very good level of enantioselectivity (up to 90&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, this transformation tolerates a variety of functional groups in both indoles and indolines.







Abstract
Axially chiral atropisomeric compounds are widely applied in asymmetric catalysis and medicinal chemistry. In particular, axially chiral indole&#8208; and indoline&#8208;based frameworks have been recognised as important heterobiaryl classes because they are the core units of bioactive natural alkaloids, chiral ligands and bioactive compounds. Among them, the synthesis of C7&#8208;substituted indole biaryls and the analogous indoline derivatives is particularly challenging, and methods for their efficient synthesis are in high demand. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is considered one of the most efficient methods to construct atropisomers. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of C7&#8208;indolino&#8208; and C7&#8208;indolo biaryl atropisomers by means of C&#8722;H functionalisation catalysed by chiral RhJasCp complexes.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Heck&#8208;Type Reactions of Allenes for Stereoselective Syntheses of Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoselective synthesis of (Z,E)&#8208;dienes from allenes is described. The method employs a Heck&#8208;type reaction catalyzed by tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium, Pd2dba3 and a CyJohnPhos ligand and does not require a leaving or directing group on the allene. The stereochemistry of both olefins of the diene is set simultaneously using both A1,3 strain and eclipsing interactions during the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination to give (Z,E)&#8201;:&#8201;(E,E) dienes in good selectivity. The method also provides regiocontrolled access to 2,4&#8208;dienoates and dienamides.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type reaction of allenes in which the stereochemistry of both olefins is set simultaneously was developed. The ligand CyJohnPhos was crucial to achieving stereoselectivity, while minimizing isomerization of the starting material through hydropalladation. The stereodetermining factors were proposed to be A1,3 strain between the catalyst and allene substituent, which influences the &#963;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;&#963; equilibrium of the coupled allene intermediate, as well as eclipsing interactions of R groups in the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Good functional group tolerance and stereoselectivities for formation of the Z,E isomer were demonstrated. The methodology was further expanded to include the regioselective formation of 2,4&#8208;dienoates and 2,4&#8208;dienamides with a variety of substitution patterns, albeit in reduced stereoselectivities favoring the E,E isomer. A plausible mechanism is proposed to account for the observed selectivities and substituent effects.

The method employs a Heck-type reaction catalyzed by tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium, Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a CyJohnPhos ligand and does not require a leaving or directing group on the allene. The stereochemistry of both olefins of the diene is set simultaneously using both A&lt;sup&gt;1,3&lt;/sup&gt; strain and eclipsing interactions during the &#946;-hydride elimination to give (&lt;i&gt;Z,E&lt;/i&gt;)&#8201;:&#8201;(&lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt;) dienes in good selectivity. The method also provides regiocontrolled access to 2,4-dienoates and dienamides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly stereoselective Pd-catalyzed Heck-type reaction of allenes in which the stereochemistry of both olefins is set simultaneously was developed. The ligand CyJohnPhos was crucial to achieving stereoselectivity, while minimizing isomerization of the starting material through hydropalladation. The stereodetermining factors were proposed to be A&lt;sup&gt;1,3&lt;/sup&gt; strain between the catalyst and allene substituent, which influences the &#963;-&#960;-&#963; equilibrium of the coupled allene intermediate, as well as eclipsing interactions of R groups in the &#946;-hydride elimination. Good functional group tolerance and stereoselectivities for formation of the &lt;i&gt;Z,E&lt;/i&gt; isomer were demonstrated. The methodology was further expanded to include the regioselective formation of 2,4-dienoates and 2,4-dienamides with a variety of substitution patterns, albeit in reduced stereoselectivities favoring the &lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt; isomer. A plausible mechanism is proposed to account for the observed selectivities and substituent effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Anthracene congestion: 1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing radially shaped &#960;&#8208;clusters were constructed by using PdI&#8208;catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions. The presence of &#960;&#8208;congestion as well as intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between anthracene units in the crystalline state gives these substances unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamics associated with the radially arranged &#960;&#8208;system were elucidated by using transient absorption measurements.







Abstract
We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of the two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamic behavior occurring between the three anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with approximately 3.0&#8197;&#197; between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.

         <title>Chiral Dinuclear EuIII, TbIII, and YIII Complexes Supported by P&#8208;Stereogenic Linear Tetraphosphine Tetraoxide</title>

A new P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;Ph2P(=O)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)Ph2 abbreviated as (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4 (L4RR/SS), was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes, [M2((R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4)(hfa)6] (M=Y, Eu, Tb: M2L4RR/SS), which revealed significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system on the basis of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) measurements.







Abstract
A P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4, was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with P&#8208;chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Y) with a P&#8208;chiral diphosphine dioxide, tpdpb(=O)2, were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the EuIII complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine is shown to induce and control the screw&#8208;sense preference of short Aib oligomers. Due to the electronic properties of the CF3 group, the screw&#8208;sense is inversed compared to that induced by its non&#8208;fluorinated isosteric l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;MeVal analogue. It also plays the role of 19F NMR reporter allowing the easy determination of both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and the assignment of its sign.







Abstract
Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 310 helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. The screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus. 1H and 19F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their N&#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 310&#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle 19F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.

&lt;p&gt;Oligomers of &#945;-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; helical structures with equal population of left- and right-handed conformers. The screw-sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR, X-ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;-trifluoromethylalanine at their &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminus induces a reversal of the screw-sense preference of the 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-helix compared to that of a non-fluorinated analogue having an &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-&#945;-methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo-electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy-to-handle &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw-sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Reconstructions Forced by Double Bow&#8208;Shaped Deformations and Second Coordination Sphere Effects of Cu(II) Heme Analogs in HER**

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of copper heme analogs has been modulated by geometric deformation. The work not only provides a new perspective on the function of natural heme distortion but also contributes a practical strategy to improve the catalytic performance of hemes through ligand geometric modulation.







Abstract
Both geometric architecture and electronic configurations of heme proteins contribute to its activity. In this work we designed and synthesized a series of four copper(II) porphyrin complexes (4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 2&#8208; and 1&#8208;Cu) where the molecular conformations are modulated by a pair of stepwise shortened straps on the same porphyrin side (cis&#8208;ortho) to give double bow&#8208;shaped skeletons. Single crystal structures demonstrate that the straps gradually increase the saddle deformation and the deviation of the metal centers, which is in accordance with two, unusual d&#8208;orbital reconstructions of two different ground states, as revealed by 4&#8197;K EPR and DFT calculations. In the study of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 1&#8208;Cu, with the shortest straps, showed the most apparent improvement of activity. Second coordination sphere (SCS) effects created by the double bow&#8208;shaped architecture and the strong saddle porphyrin core in 1&#8208;Cu are found to play key roles in proton trapping during the catalytic process. The work contributes a novel strategy to improve the catalytic performance of heme analogs through ligand geometric modulation.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>

         <dc:description>
Au&#8722;S bonding&#8208;amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for Thioglycolic acid (TGA) detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface was reported.







Abstract
Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8722;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03&#8197;&#956;M to 300&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013&#8197;&#956;M (3&#963;/m). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the concept of synchrotron radiation ECD imaging (SR&#8208;ECDi) applied to the active pharmaceutical ingredient Finasteride, we obtained an exclusive insight into the critical role played by the anisotropy of local domains in solid&#8208;state ECD spectra. Our findings open a new way to interpret solid&#8208;state chiroptical measurements and will broaden their application to probing and mapping solid chiral materials.

         <title>Linked Rotaxane Structure Restricts Local Molecular Motions in Solution to Enhance Fluorescence Properties of Tetraphenylethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to enhance the performance of fluorophores, with regards to properties such as fluorescence quantum yield and photostability, is reported in this work, using the fluorescent dye tetraphenylethylene. A linked rotaxane structure effectively prevents the local molecular motions of the fluorophore, leading to the enhancement of the performance.







Abstract
The restriction of local molecular motions is critical for improving the fluorescence quantum yields (FQYs) and the photostability of fluorescent dyes. Herein, we report a supramolecular approach to enhance the performance of fluorescent dyes by incorporating a linked rotaxane structure with permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives generally exhibit low FQYs in solution due to the molecular motions in the excited state. We show that TPE with linked rotaxane structures on two sides displays up to 15&#8208;fold higher FQYs. Detailed investigations with variable temperature 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the linked rotaxane structure rigidifies the TPE moiety and thus suppresses the local molecular motions and non&#8208;radiative decay. Moreover, the linked rotaxane structure enhances the FQY of the dye in various solvents, including aqueous solutions, and improves the photostability through the inhibition of local molecular motions in the excited TPE.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling energy levels: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F3TET, F4TET and F5TET. The solid&#8208;state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study, we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetrafluorotetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;pentafluorotetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.

     alt="Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid-State Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Controlling energy levels&lt;/b&gt;: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TET, F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TET and F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;TET. The solid-state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study, we analyzed such structure-property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12-trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12-tetrafluorotetracene and 1,2,9,10,11-pentafluorotetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro-tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red-shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium and Iridium Complexes of Anionic Thione and Selone Ligands Derived from Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal their ability to develop secondary arene&#8211;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands. More information about these new additions to the family of chalcogenolate ligands and their potential future application in coordination chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis can be found in the Research Article by M. Tamm et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104139).

         <dc:description>Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)  6  } are reduced by metallic iron in the presence of crystal violet CVCl. Anionic ligands are produced, which simultaneously coordinate three Fe  II  Cl  2  to form (CV+)2{HATA&#215;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8208;&#215;3C6H4Cl2  (1) and (CV+)3{HAT(CN)6&#215;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8208;&#215;0.5CVCl&#215;2.5C6H4Cl2  (2). High&#8208;spin (  S  =2) FeII  atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#160;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII  in {HATA&#215;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8208;  (1) with a Weiss temperature (  Q  ) of &#8208;80&#160;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (  J  ) is &#8208;4.7&#160;cm&#8208;1  . The {HAT(CN)6&#215;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8208;  assembly is obtained in  2  . The formation of HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  &#8208;  is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with  g  = 2.0037. The magnetic behavior of  2  is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  and HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  &#8208;  spins with  J  1  = &#8208;164&#160;cm  &#8208;1  (&#8208;2  J  formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  spins with  J  2  = &#8208;15.4&#160;cm  &#8208;1  . The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three Fe  II  Cl  2  units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the  c  M  T  values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#160;K up to 15.06&#160;emu&#215;K/mol at 6&#160;K, and  Q  = +23&#160;K.

         <title>Structural insights into pixatimod (PG545) inhibition of heparanase, a key enzyme in cancer and viral infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pixatimod (PG545), a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic and anticancer agent currently in clinical trials, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo &#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase that degrades HS in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and is implicated in numerous pathological processes such as cancer and viral infections, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. To understand how PG545 interacts with heparanase, we firstly carried out a conformational analysis through a combination of NMR experiments and molecular modelling which showed that the reducing end &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose residue of PG545 adopts a distorted conformation. This was followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of PG545 with heparanase, revealing that PG545 is able to block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol side&#8208;chain making important hydrophobic interactions. While PG545 blocks its natural substrate HS from binding to the active site, small synthetic heparanase substrates are only partially excluded, and thus pentasaccharide or larger substrates are preferred for assaying this class of inhibitor. This study provides new insights for the design of next&#8208;generation heparanase inhibitors and substrates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The temperature monitoring  in vivo  plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes  in vivo  allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for  in vivo  temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body.

         <title>Continuous Flow Bioconjugations of NIR&#8208;AZA Fluorophores via Strained Alkyne Cycloadditions with Intra&#8208;chip Fluorogenic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of bioconjugation reactions continues to grow for cell specific targeting and dual therapeutic plus diagnostic medical applications.&#160; This necessitates the development of new bioconjugation chemistries, in&#8208;flow synthetic and analytical methods.&#160; With this goal, continuous flow bioconjugations were readily achieved with short residence times for strained alkyne substituted carbohydrate and therapeutic peptide biomolecules in reaction with azide and tetrazine substituted fluorophores.&#160; The strained alkyne substrates included substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose, and the linear and cyclic peptide sequences QIRQQPRDPPTETLELEVSPDPAS&#8208;OH and c(RGDfK) respectively.&#160; The catalyst and reagent&#8208;free inverse electron demand tetrazine cycloadditions proved more favourable than the azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. Reaction completion was achieved with residence times of 5 min at 40 &#176;C for tetrazine versus 10 min at 80 &#176;C for azide cycloadditions.&#160; The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time.&#160; The application of continuous flow fluorogenic bioconjugations could offer an efficient translational access to theranostic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of&#160;Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and&#160;Automated&#160;Fitting Procedure for Angular&#160;Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties and reactivities of transition metal complexes are often discussed&#160;in terms of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and with  ab initio  LFT a direct connection&#160;to quantum chemical wavefunctions was recently established. The Angular&#160;Overlap Model (AOM) is a widely used, ligand&#8208;specific parameterization scheme&#160;of the ligand field splitting which has however been restricted by the availability&#160;and resolution of experimental data. Using  ab initio  LFT, we present here a generalised,&#160;symmetry&#8208;independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters&#160;that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally&#160;inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions&#160;commonly made in AOM applications, e.g. transferability or relative magnitudes&#160;of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural&#160;or electronic changes. A two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral&#160;halido metalates ([M  II  X  4  ]  2&#8208;  , M=Mn&#8211;Cu) served as a case study. A previously&#160;unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and&#160;their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for&#160;identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve&#160;our understanding of ligand&#8208;metal interactions in coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bridged Oligosilanylsilyl Mono&#8208; and Oligosilanylsilyl Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of multiple Si&#8722;H functionalities in one molecule is used to generate at low temperatures oligosilane&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dications that are stabilized by intramolecular 3c2e Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges. For the oligosilanylsilyl monocation, a rapid intramolecular Si&#8722;H group exchange is monitored by NMR spectroscopy at low temperatures. This dynamic process is not observed for the corresponding dication. According to the obtained NMR data, both cationic Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges are electronically isolated by the trisilanyl backbone.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates 8&#8201;[B(C6F5)4], 9[B(C6F5)4] and diborates 10&#8201;[B(C6F5)4]2 have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;&#8208;&#969;&#8208;dihydrido&#8208; (11) and branched tetrahydrido&#8208;oligosilanes (13) and trityl cation. The obtained cyclic intramolecularly stabilized silylium ions 8, 9 and bissilylium ion 10 were characterized by low temperature NMR spectroscopy supported by the results of density functional calculations. The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation 9 undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 via an antarafacial transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation 9 with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane 13 with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding bissilylium ion 10, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly&#8208;Lewis acids.

         <title>Calixarenes Incorporating Sulfonamide Moieties: Versatile Ligands for Carbonic Anhydrases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calixarene derivatives bearing arms terminating with primary benzensulfonamides demonstrated their ability of inhibiting human Carbonic Anhydrases with significant efficiency and selectivity among different isoforms of the enzymes. A mode of binding where the benzensulfonamide arm penetrates into the funnel of the enzyme active site and interacts with the protein Zn2+ ion is supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction data and MD calculations.







Abstract
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms, and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and molecular modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.

         <dc:description>
Photosensitizer: The first BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) has been synthesized and obtained as two atropisomers. The presence of the BOPHY light&#8208;harvesting antenna in the dyad increases the absorption of the fullerene moiety in the visible region and improves its photodynamic action. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer processes (EnT/PeT) take place from BOPHY to fullerene C60. The dyad exhibits an efficient production of reactive oxygen species. BP&#8208;C60 is a promising heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer with potential application in photodynamic treatments..







Abstract
A novel BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatment and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications. BP&#8208;C60 consists of a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a C60 moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. The BOPHY core works as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C60 subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8211;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C60. Photodynamic studies indicate that BP&#8208;C60 produces ROS by both photomechanisms (type&#8197;I and type&#8197;II). Moreover, the dyad exhibits higher ROS production efficiency than its individual constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) demonstrated the ability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.

         <title>Bonding Character, Electron Delocalization, and Aromaticity of Cyclo[18]Carbon (C18) Precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2): Focusing on the Effect of Carbonyl (&#8208;CO) Groups**

The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) were studied by advanced theoretical means. The difference of electron delocalization between two sets of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and significant influence of the number of &#8208;CO groups on them were focused on, and the essential reason for the distinct difference in molecular aromaticity was elucidated.







Abstract
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), have been studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It was found that C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8722;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960;out and &#960;in) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C18. However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) compared to C18. Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960;in system, and the &#960;out system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) with larger n shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960;out electron delocalization in the C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) and C18 in terms of the gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.

Label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence imaging of single cells has been achieved through a bipolar nanoelectrode array. The picture is divided into two parts by a strip of film, indicating that the bipolar nanoelectrode array separates cells and imaging. Oxygen is shown as the electrochemical probe and Ru(bpy)32+ as the luminescence molecule. More information can be found in the Research Article by X.&#8208;H. Xia et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>We have developed the first enantioselective reductive aldol reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids by employing a copper/bisphosphine catalyst. The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with a ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronicesters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronicesters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF  2  and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process was involved.</dc:description>

The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF  2  and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain-walking process was involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct was achieved for the first time by using a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. This reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8208;borane adducts, which is determined by the Lewis&#8208;basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. With styrene a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8208;C&#8801;CH and styrene, respectively, to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic perturbations in the substrate&#8208;binding pocket of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase determine its selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C  1  &#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C  2  &#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C  1  &#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, we performed a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C  1  &#8722;H and C  2  &#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the  pro  &#8208;  R  C  1  &#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. Our large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8211;Iodide Complex on a Catalytically Active SiO2 Surface for One&#8208;Pot Hydrosilylation&#8211;CO2 Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
A surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex for one&#8208;pot catalysis: A one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefin is developed. The hydrosilylation reaction is accelerated in the presence of a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex developed on the surface of SiO2. The decrease in steric hindrance and electron donation from iodide to Rh promote the catalytic process.







Abstract
In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between an immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N+I&#8722;) on SiO2. In the presence of ammonium cations, the SiO2&#8208;supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex could be effectively used for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxy olefins, hydrosilanes, and CO2. The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the CO2 cycloaddition were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N+I&#8722;), respectively. The catalyst exhibited much higher performance for hydrosilylation than solely the Rh complex on SiO2. The mechanism of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co&#8208;immobilized N+I&#8722;, were investigated by using Rh and I K&#8208;edge XAFS and XPS. Analysis of the XAFS profiles indicated the presence of a Rh&#8722;I bond. The Rh unit was in its electron&#8208;rich state. Curve&#8208;fitting analysis of the Rh K&#8208;edge EXAFS profiles suggests dissociation of the cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene (COD) ligand from the Rh center. Results from spectroscopic and kinetic analyses revealed that the high activity of the catalyst (during hydrosilylation) could be attributed to a decrease in steric hindrance and the electron&#8208;rich state of the Rh. The decrease in the steric hindrance could be attributed to the absence of COD, and the electron&#8208;rich state promoted the oxidative addition of Si&#8722;H. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a one&#8208;pot silylcarbonate synthesis as well as a determination of a novel surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex and its catalysis.

         <title>Z&#8208;Scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 Heterojunction for Boosting Photo&#8208;Oxidation of Sulfide into Sulfoxide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000&#8201;heterojunction photocatalysts was constructed via a solvothermal method, which efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In2S3 show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In2S3/NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (.O2&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000&#8201;heterojunction photocatalysts&lt;/b&gt; was constructed via a solvothermal method, which efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full-spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000 to afford nontoxic 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full-spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000 to afford nontoxic 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU-1000 and In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron-hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z-scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of Cyclic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions by Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions (NAIs) are highly reactive intermediates that are important for the construction of CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. These species have been characterized for the first time in the gas phase by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS), which has led to new structural information that can be invoked to explain the diastereoselectivity of reactions involving these cationic intermediates.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions are highly reactive intermediates that are important for creating CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. Here we report the characterization of cyclic N&#8208;acyliminium ions in the gas phase, generated by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy using the FELIX infrared free electron laser. Comparison of DFT calculated spectra with the experimentally observed IR spectra provided valuable insights in the conformations of the N&#8208;acyliminium ions.

         <title>Bulk Mn2+ Doped 1D Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskite with Highly Efficient, Tunable and Stable Broadband Light Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of 1D perovskite: Through controllable Mn2+ doping strategy toward bulk 1D perovskite, enhanced energy transfer from bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions gives rise to tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest PLQY up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
Mn2+ doped colloidal three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) has attracted intensive research attention; however, the low exciton binding energy and fatal optical instability of 3D PNC seriously hinder the optoelectronic application. Therefore, it remains significant to explore new stable host perovskite with strongly bound exciton to realize more desirable luminescent property. In this work, we utilized bulk one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid perovskite of [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (AEP=N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine) as structural platform to rationally optimize the luminescent property by a controllable Mn2+ doping strategy. Significantly, the series of Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O show enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the strongly bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions, resulting in tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest photoluminescence quantum yield up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskite as excellent down&#8208;converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high&#8208;performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid&#8208;state lighting and displaying devices.

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple amino acids activated by the volcanic gas carbonyl sulfide can condense into peptides that then spontaneously assemble into amyloids. This suggests a plausible prebiotic relevance of peptide amyloids and has led to the discovery that they can template sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective peptide synthesis. Depending on the environmental conditions, such amyloid templating can function in either complementary or self&#8208;replicating mode. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Riek, J. Greenwald, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103841).

         <title>Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitory Profile of New Quinoline Compounds in Cell Culture&#8208;Based Infection Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New quinoline&#8208;based compounds were synthesized via conventional synthetic methods, including copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAC) and were studied for their activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. These quinoline derivatives showed pronounced cell culture&#8208;based inhibitory profiles against the virus (EC50 down to 1.5&#177;1.0&#8197;&#956;M), thus presenting a very promising developmental basis compared to reference drugs chloroquine (EC50=3.1&#177;2.7&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
The presently ongoing pandemic of human SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infections (COVID&#8208;19) presents an enormous challenge in surveillance, vaccine and antiviral drug development. Here we report the synthesis of new bioactive quinoline&#8208;morpholine hybrid compounds and their virological evaluation, which proves pronounced cell culture&#8208;based inhibitory profile against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, selected quinoline compounds may suggest specific hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead development.

A new bi&#8208;functional ligand bearing chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and prolinol moieties is designed and applied in the generation of a Cu/Zn hetero&#8208;bimetallic complex, which unlocks the asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions of allyl phosphates with zinc keto&#8208;homoenolates generated from cyclopropanols, leading to the formation of various &#947;&#8208;vinyl ketones with good regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. DFT calculation supports that the chelation of allyl phosphates with catalyst promotes the SN2&#8217; addition and the ligand&#8208;substrate steric interactions account for the stereoselective outcome.







Abstract
A new bifunctional ligand bearing chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and prolinol moieties is presented. Utilizing the designed ligand, an in&#8197;situ formed Cu/Zn hetero&#8208;bimetallic complex unlocks the asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions of allyl phosphates with zinc keto&#8208;homoenolates, leading to the formation of various &#947;&#8208;vinyl ketones with good regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. DF&#8201;sT calculation supports that the chelation of allyl phosphates with catalyst promotes the SN2&#8217; addition and the ligand&#8208;substrate steric interactions account for the stereoselective outcome.

         <title>Highly Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodeuteration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision deuteration of unactivated alkenes: A copper&#8208;catalyzed alkene transfer hydrodeuteration for the synthesis of precisely deuterated small molecules is described. It is the most regio&#8208; and chemoselective transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes reported to date. The transformation was performed across a broad scope of substrates and even demonstrated on two natural product derivatives.







Abstract
Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;&#8208;bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom&#8208; or heterocycle&#8208;containing substrates. The base&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.

         <dc:description>
The Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) has contributed enormously to the progress of organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of skeletally diverse cyclophanyl&#8208;derived fused imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]heterocycles by one&#8208;pot GBB&#8208;3CR involving formyl&#8208;cyclophane components in combination with various aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines gives a library of versatile cyclophanyl imidazoles ligands. These can be readily transformed to prepare N,C palladacycles by regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Br&#228;se et&#8197;al.

         <title>A solid support&#8208;based synthetic strategy for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of peptides with organometallic half&#8208;sandwich moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number of donor atoms available on peptides that can competitively coordinate to metal centers renders the site&#8208;selective generation of advanced metal&#8211;peptide conjugates in high purity a challenging venture. Herein, we present a transmetalation&#8208;based synthetic approach on solid support in which an imidazolium proligand can be used to selectively anchor a range of transition metal half&#8208;sandwich complexes onto peptides in the presence of multiple coordinative motifs. Amenable to solid support, a range of N&#8208;terminus and/or lysine conjugated metal&#8208;peptide conjugates were obtained in high purity after cleavage from the resin. The metalated peptides were evaluated for their anticancer properties against human cancer cell lines. While no cytotoxic activity was observed, this platform has the potential to i) provide a pathway to site&#8208;selective peptide labelling, ii) be explored as a biorthogonal handle and/or iii) generate a new strategy for ligand design in transition metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>211At and 125I&#8208;labeling of (hetero)aryliodonium ylides: astatine wins again</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the growing interest in radioiodine and  211  At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the search for radiolabeling reactions has been somewhat neglected, resulting in a limited number of available radiosynthetic strategies. Herein we report a comparative study of nucleophilic  125  I and  211  At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides. Whereas radioiodination efficiency was low,  211  At&#8208;labeling performed efficiently on a broad scope of precursors. The most activated aryliodonium ylides led rapidly to quantitative reactions at room temperature in acetonitrile. For deactivated precursors, heating up to 90&#176;C in glyme and addition of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) as radical scavenger appeared essential to avoid precursor degradation and to achieve high radiochemical yields and molar activity. The approach was applied successfully to the preparation of 4&#8208;[  211  At]astatophenylalanine (4&#8208;APA), an amino acid derivative increasingly studied as radiotherapeutic drug for cancers. This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic  211  At&#8208;labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Switches and Motors: Recent Developments and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors has been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology,  etc  . The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in Frustrated Lewis Pair chemistry is unprecedented. We describe herein the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds  4  &#8208;  8  ) and in solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis (compounds  4  &#8208;  6  ). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel lipophilic fluorophores with highly acidity&#8208;dependent two&#8208;photon response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Here we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region  &#955;  2PA  = 550 &#8211; 1000 nm, observing 2PA cross sections of  &#963;  2PA  = 10 &#8211; 20 GM, with associated 2PEF brightness of 10 &#8211; 13 GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and  n  &#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (  TOT  ) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to  TOT  neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including  TOT  units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups, and formed microporous structures with ~1 nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of  TOT  units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the  TOT  units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of  TOT  units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;Free Cyanation of sp2 and sp&#8208;Carbons by Oxazole based Masked CN Source Using Flow Microreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp  2  and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8208;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4 + 2]/retro&#8208;[4 + 2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp  2  and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8208;CN group.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multiple&#8208;Layered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first chiral multi&#8208;layer 3D folding polymers have been assembled and regulated by both uniformed and differentiated aromatic chromophoric units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers was proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura poly&#8208;couplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute stereochemistry and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61,960 M w /41,900 M n and m / z = 4317 for polymers and oligomers as confirmed by GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS indicated that the present frameworks were composed of multiple layers stacked. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (PL in solids and AIE in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone Photoswitches for Structural Modulation of Short Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules that undergo light&#8208;driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.</dc:description>

RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, a specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator, is synthesized for the first time based on the retrosynthetic outline depicted, enabling its structural elucidation and biological evaluations against S. aureus and zymosan A induced inflammation.







Abstract
Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a Z&#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA methyl ester in 13&#8201;% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of Staphylococcus aureus and zymosan A bioparticles.

         <title>Structural and Functional Analysis of Bacterial Sulfonosphingolipids and Rosette&#8208;Inducing Factor 2 (RIF&#8208;2) by Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Guided Isolation and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Similarities across species: MS&#8208;guided isolation and the first total synthesis of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids allowed bioactivity studies on their rosette&#8208;inducing and inhibiting capabilities in Salpingoeca rosetta. The most abundant sulfonosphingolipids inhibited rosette inducing factor&#8208;related activity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner thus suggesting that sulfobacins are likely competing for the same cellular target in S. rosetta.







Abstract
We have analyzed the abundance of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids, including rosette&#8208;inducing factors (RIFs), in seven bacterial prey strains by using high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS2) and molecular networking (MN) within the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) web platform. Six sulfonosphingolipids resembling RIFs were isolated and their structures were elucidated based on comparative MS and NMR studies. Here, we also report the first total synthesis of two RIF&#8208;2 diastereomers and one congener in 15 and eight synthetic steps, respectively. For the total synthesis of RIF&#8208;2 congeners, we employed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize the necessary branched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids, and the Garner&#8208;aldehyde approach to generate the capnine base carrying three stereogenic centers. Bioactivity studies in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta revealed that the rosette inducing activity of RIFs is inhibited dose dependently by the co&#8208;occurring sulfonosphingolipid sulfobacins D and F and that activity of RIFs is specific for isolates obtained from Algoriphagus.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR&#8208;Driven Crystal Structure Prediction of Molecular Crystals: The Case of Mebendazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make it faster! A combined Crystal Structure Prediction &#8211; NMR crystallography (CSP&#8197;NMRX) approach is presented for solving the structures of the three polymorphs, A, B, and C, of mebendazole. These are characterized by three different tautomeric forms, that is, they are desmotropes. The predicted structures show perfect overlapping with the experimental ones, with that of form B solved de novo from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Among all possible NMR crystallography approaches for crystal&#8208;structure determination, crystal structure prediction &#8211; NMR crystallography (CSP&#8208;NMRX) has recently turned out to be a powerful method. In the latter, the original procedure exploited solid&#8208;state NMR (SSNMR) information during the final steps of the prediction. In particular, it used the comparison of computed and experimental chemical shifts for the selection of the correct crystal packing. Still, the prediction procedure, generally carried out with DFT methods, may require important computational resources and be quite time&#8208;consuming, especially if there are no available constraints to use at the initial stage. Herein, the successful application of this combined prediction method, which exploits NMR information also in the input step to reduce the search space of the predictive algorithm, is presented. Herein, this method was applied on mebendazole, which is characterized by desmotropism. The use of SSNMR data as constraints for the selection of the right tautomer and the determination of the number of independent molecules in the unit cell led to a considerably faster process, reducing the number of calculations to be performed. In this way, the crystal packing was successfully predicted for the three known phases of mebendazole. To evaluate the quality of the predicted structures, these were compared to the experimental ones. The crystal structure of phase&#8197;B of mebendazole, in particular, was determined de novo by powder diffraction and is presented for the first time in this paper.

Selective photoreaction under shielded conditions. We have developed near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activatable phthalocyanine catalysts. In this image, the colors of the cars show the kind of light. The visible wavelengths (rainbow colors) are blocked (traffic cones); only NIR light (the gray vehicle) can pass to interact with the phthalocyanine catalyst. After this photoreaction, singlet oxygen (as 1O2) and product are generated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Furuyama, H. Nakai, et&#8197;al.

         <title>An Alkynyl&#8208;Dangling Ru(II) Polypyridine Complex for Targeted Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;dangling ruthenium(II) polypyridine complex Ru2, which may rapidly conjugate to the amino groups on the unique membrane lipids of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through the bio&#8208;orthogonal amino&#8208;yne click reaction has been investigated. Such a selective labeling process in combination with its good singlet oxygen quantum yield makes Ru2 to be able to photo&#8208;inactivate bacterial such as S. aureus and MRSA efficiently and specifically, but leaving mammalian cells undamaged under the same conditions.







Abstract
To realize clinical application of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), one of the most arduous challenges is how to render aPDT agents high selectivity against bacterial pathogens. In light of the fact that amino group&#8208;containing lipids are rich on the outer surfaces of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, we herein constructed an alkynyl&#8208;dangling ruthenium(II) polypyridine complex (Ru2) to preferentially label Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) over mammalian cells via the amino&#8208;yne bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Thanks to the strong singlet oxygen generation ability, Ru2 could photo&#8208;inactivate S. aureus and MRSA effectively and specifically. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules also exist in mammalian cells but are not accessible for Ru2, leading to its poor binding/uptake and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark and upon irradiation towards mammalian cells as well as low hemolysis, all favorable for aPDT application.

         <title>Promoter&#8208;Driven Overexpression in Chromobacterium vaccinii Facilitates Access to FR900359 and Yields Novel Low Abundance Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promoter&#8208;driven overexpression of the frs biosynthetic gene cluster, encoding the nonribosomal peptide assembly line for FR900359, in Chromobacterium vaccinii resulted in up to 8&#8208;fold increase in production compared to the wild type. Thereby, the challenging access to FR could be significantly enhanced and novel low abundance analogs of FR were made accessible for characterization of their structures and concerning their growth inhibition of uveal melanoma cell lines.







Abstract
Access to the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), a selective Gq/11 protein inhibitor of high pharmacological interest and a potential lead molecule for targeted therapy of cancers with oncogenic GNAQ or GNA11 mutations (encoding Gq and G11 respectively), has been challenging ever since its initial discovery more than three decades ago. The recent discovery of Chromobacterium vaccinii as a cultivable FR producer enables the development of approaches leading to a high&#8208;yielding, scalable and sustainable biotechnological process for production of FR, thereby removing this bottleneck. Here we characterize different promoters in exchange of the native promoter of the FR assembly line, resulting in an overexpression mutant with significantly increased production of FR. Thereby, the isolation and structure elucidation of novel FR analogs of low abundance is enabled. Further, we explore the antiproliferative activities of fifteen chromodepsins against uveal melanoma cell lines harboring Gq/11 mutations and characterize the major metabolite of FR formed in plasma.

         <title>Piers&#8242; Borane&#8208;Induced Tetramerization of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocyclization: The formation of tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes upon the reaction of arylacetylenes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. Isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations indicate that the mechanism of this complex transformation commences with a series of unprecedented 1,2&#8208;carboborations, followed by an electrocyclization and two skeletal rearrangements.







Abstract
We herein report that the reaction of Piers&#8242; borane, i.&#8201;e. HB(C6F5)2, with an excess of arylacetylenes at room temperature leads to tetramerization of the acetylene and the diastereoselective formation of boryl&#8208;substituted tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes. The reaction mechanism was investigated by isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations. These investigations indicate that a series of 1,2&#8208;carboboration reactions form an octatetraene that undergoes an electrocyclization. Two skeletal rearrangements then presumably lead to the formation of the tetrahydropentalene core. Overall, this intricate and unprecedented transformation comprises five carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations in a single reaction.

         <title>Electrodeposition of Defect&#8208;Rich Ternary NiCoFe Layered Double Hydroxides: Fine Modulation of Co3+ for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective but efficient: The binder&#8208;free Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF, with a unique nanoarray structural feature, was fabricated as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF showed the optimized electronic structure and exposed more defects than Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;mono prepared by traditional coprecipitation method. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF demonstrated excellent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 209&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;abundance and durable layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the easy agglomeration of lamellar LDHs in the aqueous phase limits their practical applications. Herein, a series of ternary NiCoFe LDHs were successfully fabricated on nickel foam (NF) via a simple electrodeposition method. The as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF displayed an unique nanoarray structural feature. It showed an OER overpotential of 209&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline solution, which was superior to most systems reported so far. As evidenced by the XPS and XAFS results, such excellent performance of Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF was attributed to the higher Co3+/Co2+ ratio and more defects exposed, comparing with Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;mono LDHs prepared by conventional coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the ratio of Co to Fe could significantly tune the Co electronic structure of Ni(CoxFe1&#8208;x)/NF composites (x=0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) and affect the electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF showed the lowest energy barrier for OER rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*). This work proposes a facile method to develop high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Coexistence of Tellurium Cations and Anions in Phosphonium&#8208;Based Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grey tellurium dissolves under disproportionation in the ionic liquids [P66614][OAc] and [P4444][OAc] at ambient temperatures. The stable red&#8208;purple solutions contain tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, as evidenced by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the components of the ILs stabilize tellurium cations and anions in solution.







Abstract
Elemental tellurium readily dissolves in ionic liquids (ILs) based on tetraalkylphosphonium cations even at temperatures below 100&#8201;&#176;C. In the case of ILs with acetate, decanoate, or dicyanamide anions, dark red to purple colored solutions form. A study combining NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of tellurium anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, which are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. Since external influences could be excluded and no evidence of an ionic liquid reaction was found, disproportionation of the tellurium is the only possible dissolution mechanism. Although the spectroscopic detection of tellurium cations in these solutions is difficult, the coexistence of tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and tellurium anions could be proven by cyclic voltammetry and electrodeposition experiments. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ILs are sufficient to stabilize both types of tellurium ions in solution.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Unusual Stabilization of&#160;cis&#8208;Isomers by a Spherical Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore new cavity functions, we herein employed&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160; stereoisomers &#160; with a N=N, C=C, or C=N unit as guest indicators for a polyaromatic capsule. Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of ~1 nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100%&#160;  cis  &#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the&#160;  cis  &#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore,&#160;  C,N  &#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable&#160;  cis  &#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160; isomers &#160;could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Portrait of a Family of Highly Stabilizing and Selective Guanine Quadruplex Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and biophysical screening of guanine quadruplex stabilization and binding properties of a family of platinum di&#8208;imine complexes are described. The second&#8208;generation binders display enhanced stabilization and selectivity compared to the parent compound, bearing much promise for the future evolution of this novel platform.







Abstract
The long&#8208;standing history of platinum coordination complexes in nucleic acid recognition attests to the unique suitability of such species for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthetic exploration and development of a family of di&#8208;imine ligands, and their platinum(II) complexes, elaborated on a 3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]pyridine platform which, in its unsubstituted form, has recently been shown to display exceptional capabilities for guanine quadruplex (G4) targeting. The identification of facile, high&#8208;yielding synthetic methods for the derivatization of this platform for the incorporation of additional sites of interactions with guanine quadruplex loops and grooves, along with the optimization of platinum(II) complexation methods, are discussed. Gratifyingly, preliminary biophysical screening of this novel family of binders validates all but one family members as robust G4 binders and highlights enhanced selectivity for quadruplex versus duplex DNA compared to the parent compound. These results bear promise for practical developments based on this platform.

         <title>Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd&#8208; G11 M(PPh 3 )](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 3 ), Ag ( 4 ); CNC = 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd} 2 G11 M](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 6 ), Ag ( 5 )) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11 M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8208;Au &gt; Pt&#8208;Au &gt; Pd&#8208;Ag &gt; Pt&#8208;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Structural designs combining cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) backbone with planar chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) lead to optical&#8208;active chiral macrocycles with intriguing properties. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis revealed aesthetic necklace&#8208;shaped structures and size&#8208;dependent packages with long&#8208;range channels. The macrocycles exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82%, and the fluorescent color varies with ring size. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large CPL dissymmetry factor of 10  &#8208;3  and CPL brightness in the range of 30 &#8208; 40 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  were observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights on Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Feature of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is currently continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of S protein. The binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes of Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2' were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was significantly higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation on Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth,  d  10  electron configuration, and 6s  2  lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework  from AEB  4  O  6  F  2  (AE = Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, M  II  B  4  O  6  F  2  (M  II  = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (  route&#8208;I  ), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB  4  O  6  F  2  structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146 nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064 nm  ,  and the PbB  4  O  6  F  2  structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194 nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064 nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;Chiral Concave Complexes: Aggregation and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;symmetric complexes bearing triphenyl (1) and trialkyl phosphine ligands (2 and 3) were synthesized and studied. In CHCl3/MeOH mixtures 1 and 2 showed an AIE effect at 540&#8197;nm, probably originating from aurophilic interactions. 3 showed AIE only in nearly pure MeOH and in the solid state. The aggregation of optically pure 1 started at lower MeOH content than (&#177;)&#8208;1, indicating that the latter gave racemates rather than conglomerates.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I) acetylide trinuclear complexes 1&#8211;3 based on the cyclotribenzylene platform and terminal PR3 ligands (R=Ph, Et, and Cy, respectively), were characterized and their light emission studied. They exhibited long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence in CHCl3 and a weak fluorescence in the UV. In MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures of &gt;1:1 volume ratio, 1 and 2 exhibited a new emission band at ca. 540&#8197;nm that developed at the expense of the UV emission. DLS studies demonstrated the presence of molecular aggregates of &#216; 30&#8211;80&#8197;nm. The green emission observed in MeOH&#8208;rich solvent mixtures was therefore induced by aggregation, and could originate from Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The AIE spectrum of 3 was observed only in solutions containing 99&#8201;% of MeOH, and correlated with its solid state emission. The AIE profiles of the enantiomers of 1 differed from that of rac&#8208;1, suggesting that the latter is a true racemate.

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of SAPO&#8208;34 Molecular Sieves</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the conventional: SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves have excellent form selection and controllability in the chemical industry, as well as being one of the best industrial catalysts for converting methanol to olefin. The synthesis methods and applications of conventional, hierarchical, and nanosized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are introduced in this review, and the advantages and shortcomings of each synthesis method are compared, along with their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance.







Abstract
Silicoaluminophosphate zeolite (SAPO&#8208;34) has been attracting increasing attention due to its excellent form selection and controllability in the chemical industry, as well as being one of the best industrial catalysts for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reaction conversion. However, as a microporous molecular sieve, SAPO&#8208;34 easily generates carbon deposition and rapidly becomes inactivated. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the crystal size of the zeolite or to introduce secondary macropores into the zeolite crystal to form a hierarchical structure in order to improve the catalytic effect. In this review, the synthesis methods of conventional SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves, hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves and nanosized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are introduced, and the properties of the synthesized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are described, including the phase, morphology, pore structure, acid source, and catalytic performance, in particular with respect to the synthesis of hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves. We hope that the review can provide guidance to the preparation of the SAPO&#8208;34 catalysts, and stimulate the future development of high&#8208;performance hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 catalysts to meet the growing demands of the material and chemical industries.

         <title>Nanostructured Manganese Oxides within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate Exhibiting Unusual Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively, were synthesized inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate cavity, and Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the aerobic oxygenation of alkylarenes through a unique reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nanosized manganese oxides have recently received considerable attention for their synthesis, structures, and potential applications. Although various synthetic methods have been developed, precise synthesis of novel nanostructured manganese oxides are still challenging. In this study, using a structurally defined nanosized cavity inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively. In particular, Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the oxygenation of alkylarenes including electron&#8208;deficient ones, and the reaction proceeded through a unique reaction mechanism due to its unusual manganese oxide structure.

         <title>BBr3&#8208;Mediated P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Borylation of Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron Chemistry. An efficient metal&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines directed by P(III) atom just using BBr3. This robust method enables the rapid construction of phosphine boronate esters in selective, practical, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly modes.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation has been widely used in the preparation of organoboron compounds. Here, we developed a general protocol on metal&#8208;free P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines mediated by BBr3, resulting in the formation of products bearing both phosphorus and boron. The development of the metal&#8208;free strategy to mimic previous metallic processes has shown low cost, superior practicality, and environmental friendliness. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the preferred pathway for this metal&#8208;free directed C&#8722;H borylation process.

         <title>Probing the Lewis Acidity of Boronic Acids through Interactions with Arene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids, specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8211;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>C(spn)&#8211;X (n = 1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X&#160;bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH  3  , Cl) in archetypal model substrates H  3  C&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;X, H  2  C=CH&#8211;X and HC&#8801;C&#8211;X by catalysts PdL  n  &#160;with L  n  &#160;= no ligand, Cl  &#8211;  , and (PH  3  )  2  , using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases&#160;going from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  2  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from&#160;  sp  3  &#160;to&#160;  sp  2  &#160;to&#160;  sp  , originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X, which goes from four, to three, to two&#160;along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X&#160;to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Influence of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diazo Compounds on the Catalyst Efficiency of B(C6F5)3 Towards Carbene Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Diazo compounds have been largely used for carbene transfer reactions in a variety of functionalization reactions. Recently, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C  6  F  5  )  3  ] has been shown to be an efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst for carbene transfer reactions. Herein, we report a  Density Functional Theory  (DFT) study on the generation of carbene species from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds using catalytic amounts of B(C  6  F  5  )  3  . We observe that the efficiency of the catalyst depends directly on the nature of the substituents on both the aryl ring and the carbonyl group of the substrate. In some cases, we observe that the boron catalyst has negligible effect on the ease of the carbene formation, while in other cases there is a dramatic reduction in the activation energy of the reaction. This direct dependence is not commonly observed in catalysis and our finding opens the way for intelligent design of this and other similar catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism&#160;of cyclopentane: an&#160;experimental&#160;and theoretical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by analogy comparison&#160;with non&#8208;cyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and non&#8208;cycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy is not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8208;3 atm&#160;and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 K and 800&#160;K. The low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, highly oxygenated intermediates (e.g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of&#160;the oxidation of CPT, the electronic structure calculations at the&#160;UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p)&#160;level&#160;were carried out to explore the reactivity of O2&#160;molecules adding sequentially&#160;to cyclopentyl radicals.&#160;Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2&#160;is HO2&#160;elimination, yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2&#160;addition, the dissociation of hydroperoxide were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new series of lanthanide (  1&#8208;5  ) and uranyl (  6  ) complexes with a tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand  H  2  L  is described. The coordination environment for the Ln  3+  and UO  2  2+  ions is provided by phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups appended to the lower rim of the  p&#8208;tert  &#8208;butylcalix[4]arene scaffold. Ligand interactions with lanthanide cations (light: La  3+  , Pr  3+  ; intermediate: Eu  3+  and Gd  3+  ; and heavy: Yb  3+  ), as well as the uranyl cation (UO  2  2+  ) is examined in the solution and solid state, respectively with spectrophotometric titration and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The ligand is fully deprotonated in the complexation of trivalent lanthanide ions forming di&#8208;cationic complexes 2:2 M:  L  , [Ln  2  (  L  )  2  (H  2  O)]  2+  (  1  &#8208;  5  ), in solution, whereas uranyl formed a 1:1 M:  L  complex [UO  2  (  L  )(MeOH)]  &#8734;  (  6  ) that demonstrated very limited solubility in 12 organic solvents. Solvent extraction behaviour is examined for cation selectivity and extraction efficiency.  H  2  L  was found to be an effective extracting agent for UO  2  2+  over La  3+  and Yb  3+  cations. The separation factors at pH 6.0 are: [[EQUATION]] = 121.0 and [[EQUATION]] = 70.0.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Channel Engineering for Rapid Ion Transport: From Nature to Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by rapid and selective ion transport behaviours commonly identified in biological systems, ion transport properties in solid and liquid crystals are crucial for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, including electrode materials and electrolytes, which are critically reviewed and summarized. It is expected that this review could provide some new design principles for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries based on this understanding of natural ion transport phenomena.







Abstract
Ion transport behaviours through cell membranes are commonly identified in biological systems, which are crucial for sustaining life for organisms. Similarly, ion transport is significant for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Rapid ion transport can be well achieved by crystal channels engineering, such as creating pores or tailoring interlayer spacing down to the nanometre or even sub&#8208;nanometre scale. Furthermore, some functional channels, such as ion selective channels and stimulus&#8208;responsive channels, are developed for smart ion storage applications. In this review, the typical ion transport phenomena in the biological systems, including ion channels and pumps, are first introduced, and then ion transport mechanisms in solid and liquid crystals are comprehensively reviewed, particularly for the widely studied porous inorganic/organic hybrid crystals and ultrathin inorganic materials. Subsequently, recent progress on the ion transport properties in electrodes and electrolytes is reviewed for rechargeable batteries. Finally, current challenges in the ion transport behaviours in rechargeable batteries are analysed and some potential research approaches, such as bioinspired ultrafast ion transport structures and membranes, are proposed for future studies. It is expected that this review can give a comprehensive understanding on the ion transport mechanisms within crystals and provide some novel design concepts on promoting electrochemical ion storage capability in rechargeable batteries.

         <dc:description>Bistable spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;  T  1/2  ) spin&#8208;state switching are desirable for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications. In this study, we report on the structural facets governing hysteretic SCO in a set of iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes&#8212;[Fe(bpp&#8208;COOEt)  2  ](X)  2  &#183;CH  3  NO  2  (X = ClO  4  ,  1  ; X = BF  4  ,  2  ). Stable spin&#8208;state switching&#8212;  T  1/2  = 288 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 62 K&#8212;is observed for  1  , whereas  2  underwent above room&#8208;temperature lattice&#8208;solvent content&#8208;dependent SCO&#8212;  T  1/2  = 331 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 43 K. Variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations&#8212;from the Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted HS&#8208;state to less distorted LS&#8208;state&#8212;and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in  1  and  2  . Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule&#8208;based switching and memory elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Light sensitive phenacyl crosslinked dextran hydrogels for controlled delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials enable controlled release of loaded drug molecules and biomolecules. Controlled release of potent chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agent is crucial to reduce unwanted side effects. In an effort to develop controlled release strategies that can be triggered using Cerenkov luminescence, we have developed polymer hydrogels that can release bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G using light (254 nm &#8211; 375 nm) as a trigger. We describe the synthesis and photochemical characterization of two light sensitive phenacyl bis&#8208;azide crosslinkers that are used to prepare transparent self&#8208;supporting hydrogel patches. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (14%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375 nm light. We used the extended phenacyl crosslinker for the preparation of protein&#8208;loaded dextran hydrogel patches, which showed efficient and selective dosed release of bovine serum albumin or immunoglobulin G after irradiation with 375 nm light. Cerenkov&#8208;triggered release is as yet inconclusive due to unexpected side&#8208;reactivity. Based on the high quantum yield, efficient release and large overlap with the Cerenkov window, we envision application of these photosensitive soft materials in radiation targeted drug release.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Alkali&#8208;Metal Effects in the Structures and Reactivity of Mixed&#8208;Ligand Alkyl/Alkoxide Alkali&#8208;Metal Magnesiates</title>

         <dc:description>Advancing understanding of using alkali&#8208;metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8208;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed&#8208;ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates [MMg(CH2SiMe3)2(dmem)]2[dmem= 2&#8208;{[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M= Li,&#160;1; Na,&#160;2; (THF)K,&#160;3] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali&#8208;metal effect with potassium magnesiate&#160;3&#160;being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr2(dmem)]2&#160;(Ar=&#160;o&#8208;OMe&#8208;C6H4)&#160;intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]n&#160;and [MgAr(dmem)]2&#160;(5). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;= 2&#8208;ethylhexyl) which undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Mg(CH2SiMe3) to give [KMg(CH2SiMe3)2(OR&#8217;)]2&#160;(7). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2&#8208;bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr2(OR&#8217;)]2&#160;(9) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali&#8208;metal mediated Mg&#8208;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>

Direct action: A highly stereoselective glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages is disclosed, which employs a combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent and exploits glycosidation via glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. A variety of natural saponins containing (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan motifs are thus synthesized in convergent manner by direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors.







Abstract
Conventional syntheses of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement for a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here, a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG is disclosed; it employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with 12 (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and 13 alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative, naturally occurring triterpene saponins were thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicated that this glycosylation proceeds by SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8722;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species that activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8722; ensures an uninterruptive role for the glycosidation.

         <title>Rhodium and Iridium Complexes of Anionic Thione and Selone Ligands Derived from Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Taken under its wing: Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal, inter alia, their ability to develop secondary arene&#8208;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands.







Abstract
The lithium salts of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones and selones [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}Li(toluene)] (1: E=S; 2: E=Se; WCA=B(C6F5)3, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which contain a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety in the imidazole backbone were reacted with Me3SiCl, to furnish the silylated adducts (WCA&#8208;IDipp)ESiMe3 (3: E=S; 4: E=Se). The reaction of the latter with [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)MCl2]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the rhodium(III) and iridium(III) half&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}MCl(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)] (5&#8211;8). The direct reaction of the lithium salts 1 and 2 with a half or a full equivalent of [M(COD)Cl]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the monometallic complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M(COD)] (9&#8211;12) or the bimetallic complexes [&#956;2&#8208;{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M2(COD)2(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)] (13&#8211;16), respectively. The bonding situation in these complexes has been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing thiolate or selenolate ligand character with negligible metal&#8208;chalcogen &#960;&#8208;interaction.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial proteases able to hydrolyze insoluble proteins in the presence of surfactants remains essential for their structural characterization. Therefore, we report for the first time metal&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate complexes (M&#8208;K 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 where M = Zr(IV) or Hf(IV)) as catalysts for the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein, zein, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) via a competitive binding mechanism, which results in a dependence of the hydrolysis on the surfactant concentration.







Abstract
Despite the enormous importance of insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] (M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in ternary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering measurements.

         <title>Interfacially Super&#8208;Assembled Benzimidazole Derivative&#8208;Based Mesoporous Silica Nanoprobe for Sensitive Copper (II) Detection and Biosensing in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique mesoporous silica nanoprobe (DHBM&#8208;MSN) based on benzimidazole derivative is constructed for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. The designed DHBM&#8208;MSN has obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solution with extremely low detection limit. The detection system is successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice and live cells. The results indicate that DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with benzimidazole&#8208;derived fluorescent molecules (DHBM) are fabricated via a feasible interfacial superassembly strategy for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. DHBM&#8208;MSN exhibits an obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solutions, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;M. The DHBM&#8208;MSN solid&#8208;state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that nanocarriers with different morphologies do not affect the specific detectionability. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental results and density function theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. These results indicate that the DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.

DHBM-MSN exhibits an obvious quenching effect on Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous solutions, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M. The DHBM-MSN solid-state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that nanocarriers with different morphologies do not affect the specific detectionability. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental results and density function theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. These results indicate that the DHBM-MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Oximes to Hydroxylamines: Current Methods, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to access hydroxylamine derivatives? Likely, one of the most straightforward strategy involves the catalytic reduction of oximes. These substrates are however difficult to reduce selectively as overeduction breaks their weak N&#8722;O bond giving primary amines instead. The few different capable catalytic systems are overviewed in this minireview as well as new opportunities for advancing the research field are suggested.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8722;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the E/Z&#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Photosynthetic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to emulate functions of the native photosynthetic apparatus by artificial systems are introduced. One approach involves the integration of native photosynthetic systems with artificial materials onto electrode surfaces to yield photobioelectrochemical cells. A second approach involves the assembly of supramolecular photosensitizer/electron acceptor assemblies leading to the efficient light&#8208;induced formational of election&#8208;transfer redox products. A third approach addresses the design of dynamic networks stimulating controlled electron&#8208;transfer processes leading to the formation of fuel products under thermodynamically&#8208;guided or out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.







Abstract
Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents recent advances towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid/electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Gold Nanoclusters: Synthesis Strategies, Optical Properties, and Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in water&#8208;dispersible gold nanoclusters in terms of their synthesis strategies, optical properties, and bio&#8208;applications is discussed. Different synthesis strategies for water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs are highlighted. The progress achieved in the optical properties and biological applications of these molecules is also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for their further development of are presented.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. Intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels have endowed them with fascinating electronic and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the fields of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, biochemical sensing, bio&#8208;imaging, and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most AuNCs are synthesized in organic solvents and do not disperse in aqueous solutions; this restricts their biological applications. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs and their biological applications. We first review different methods of synthesis, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic AuNCs. We then discuss their photophysical properties, such as emission enhancement and fluorescence lifetimes. Next, we summarize their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outline the challenges and potential for the future development of these AuNCs.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Cell Adhesions by Using Bipolar Nanoelectrode Array</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method for fast and positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed using oxygen as the electrochemical probe. The successful imaging is achieved by transient generation of difference in oxygen concentration over the nanoelectrodes covered with or without cells. Thus, cell morphology and adhesion strength can be imaged.







Abstract
A label&#8208;free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving voltage of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V is applied to in&#8197;situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1&#8197;V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label&#8208;free imaging of single cells.

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Cu nanosheets array support structure was provided as the substrate of organic photocathode, which provides more reactive sites and increases the effective light absorption area. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu NSA increases the distribution range of the built&#8208;in electric field, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the photocatalytic performance. The proposal of the simple support structure provides a direction for the design and implementation of spatially separated PEC cell.







Abstract
The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carrier separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced a copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50&#8197;mV to 0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and co&#8208;catalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14&#8201;% in neutral solution.

     alt="Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A simple Cu nanosheets array support structure&lt;/b&gt; was provided as the substrate of organic photocathode, which provides more reactive sites and increases the effective light absorption area. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu NSA increases the distribution range of the built-in electric field, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the photocatalytic performance. The proposal of the simple support structure provides a direction for the design and implementation of spatially separated PEC cell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Z-scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z-scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carrier separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced a copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built-in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3-hexylthiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;[6,6]-phenyl-C&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;-butyric acid (P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50&#8197;mV to 0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and co-catalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14&#8201;% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interdisciplinary character of the Horizon2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;EJD TubInTrain project allowed a challenging study of the peculiarity of maytansinoids as tubulin binders. The enthusiasm of PhD students proved fundamental for productively merging synthesis, biological evaluation, X&#8208;ray crystallography and docking studies. The good agreement of computational and experimental sheds further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and provides a solid foundation for the future design, synthesis and analysis of next&#8208;generation maytansinoids. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Passarella et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103520).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytically conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reaction. Here, we introduce a concept&#8208;new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and NO  x  &#8208;  reduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback. Due to the increased awareness of the chemical waste impact on the environment, synthetic studies have been driven by the goal of finding non&#8208;toxic reagents. The main focus of this review is to highlight recent methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired transformations to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are reported. An important biosynthetic transformation mediated by &#946;&#8208;glycosidase were replaced with a simple removal of the silyl group from designed strictosidine aglycone silyl ether derivatives. Subsequent bioinspired transformations under substrate control resulted in the concise and divergent total syntheses of heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids.







Abstract
A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8722;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8722;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13&#8197;steps.

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three equivalents of heteroallene can be captured between the Si&#8722;P bonds of Zintl&#8208;derived clusters. Silyl coordination at either the nitrogen or chalcogen of the heteroallene can be controlled by tuning the groups on the silyl moiety or functional groups at the heteroallene. It was also found that one captured small molecule can be exchanged for another, evidencing small molecule catch and release at these clusters.







Abstract
Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P7(SiR3)3) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.

         <title>Utilisation of CO2 as &#8220;Structure Modifier&#8221; of Inorganic Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is abundant and free but environmentally unfriendly. It is also unreactive, hence re&#8208;purposing can be a challenge. This research article describes how CO2 can be used as a useful reagent towards the preparation and/or chemical and structural modification of inorganic solids. This approach is of wide application hence, in the future, it may become part of a toolbox of methods to reduce the environmental impact of CO2.







Abstract
Utilisation of CO2 as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule's inherent chemical stability. However, CO2 reacts promptly at high temperature (&#8764;1000&#8201;&#176;C) with alkaline&#8208;earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re&#8208;utilisation. In this work, this concept is extended and CO2 is utilised as a reagent to modify the crystal structure of mixed&#8208;metal inorganic solids. Modification of the crystal structure is a &#8220;tool&#8221; used by materials scientists to tailor the physical property of solids. CO2 gas was reacted with several isostructural mixed&#8208;metal oxides Sr2CuO3, Sr1.8Ba0.2CuO3 and Ba2PdO3. These oxides are carefully selected to show anion vacancies in their crystal structure, to act as host sites for CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of carbonate anions, (CO3)2&#8722;. The corresponding oxide carbonates were formed successfully and the favourable formation of SrCO3 as secondary phase was minimised via an innovative, yet simple synthetic procedure involving alternating of CO2 and air. We also derived a simple model to predict the kinetics of the reactions for the cuprates, using first&#8208;principles density functional theory and assimilating the reaction to a gas&#8208;surface process.

         <title>Properties of Single&#8208;Component Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) were produced, where the materials contained a crystalline and glass phase from the same parent zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF): ZIF&#8208;62(Zn). The composites displayed thermal and adsorptive properties present in both the original crystalline and glass materials and interfacial compatibility between the two phases was evident. A mixed&#8208;metal Co/Zn analogue was also produced to further examine phase&#8208;mixing.







Abstract
The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF&#8208;62(Zn) was incorporated within an agZIF&#8208;62(Zn) matrix. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of agZIF&#8208;62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed&#8208;metal (ZIF&#8208;62(Co))0.5(agZIF&#8208;62(Zn))0.5 analogue. CO2 gas adsorption measurements showed that the CO2 uptakes of the MOF&#8208;CGCs were between those of the crystalline and glassy phases.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>

It depends how you look at it: By exploring randomly formed domains of microcrystalline finasteride dispersed in a KCl pellet with the spatial resolution of 0.1&#8197;mm granted by synchrotron source, we noticed that anisotropic ECDi (ACD) spectra might be very different from the emergent solid&#8208;state ECD spectrum recorded on a commercial instrument, which is similar to the solution ECD. Consequently, we got an exclusive insight into the critical role played by local domains.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ECD (ss&#8208;ECD) spectra of a model microcrystalline solid, finasteride, dispersed into a KCl pellet were recorded by using the synchrotron radiation source at the Diamond B23 beamline. Scanning a surface of 36&#8197;mm2 with a step of 0.5&#8197;mm, we measured a set of ECD imaging (ECDi) spectra very different from each other and from the ss&#8208;ECD recorded with a bench&#8208;top instrument (1&#8197;cm2 area). This is due to the anisotropic part of the ECD (ACD), which averages to zero in solution or on a large number of randomly oriented crystallites, but can otherwise be extremely large. Two&#8208;way singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, through experimental and simulated TDDFT spectra, disclosed that the measured and theoretical principal components are in line with each other. This finding demonstrates that the observed isotropic ss&#8208;ECD spectrum is governed by the anisotropy of locally oriented crystals. It also introduces a new quality for ss&#8208;ECD measurements and opens a new future for probing and mapping chiral materials in the solid state such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photodynamics of the methylated isomer, N1&#8208;methylpseudouridine (m1&#968;), which is commonly used in mRNA therapeutics were investigated alongside the canonical base uridine; m1&#968; was found to have a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield than uridine. However, following UVC irradiation m1&#968; is shown to be ca. 6.7&#8197;times more photostable than uridine.







Abstract
N1&#8208;Methylation of pseudouridine (m1&#968;) replaces uridine (Urd) in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m1&#968; is compared to that of uridine by using photoirradiation at 267&#8197;nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m1&#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both molecules decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m1&#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than Urd following irradiation at 267&#8197;nm.

         <title>Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active Photochromic Phenanthrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of photochromic phenanthrene derivatives bearing pyridine or pyridinium units have been synthetized and characterized by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the different substitution positions yield to a drastic difference on the photo and electrochromic properties of these systems. These compounds derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds show good qualities for the applications in optoelectronic devices, as opto&#8208;transistors or in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
A phenanthrene unit has been functionalized by several methylthiophene units in order to bring it a photochromic behavior. These compounds were characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies, theoretical calculations as well as cyclic voltammetry. The association of a phenanthrene group with a photochromic center could open the door to a new generation of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium, the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide, the aluminium bis(hydrogensulfide), the six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide as well as a rare five&#8208;membered heterocyclic aluminium sulfide were synthesized controllably in mild manners. Reactions of the known dihydridoaluminium and the terphenyl dihydridoaluminium with various thiation reagents formed a series of aluminium&#8208;sulfur species. This provided insights into the influence of the supporting ligands on the reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions owing to limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (1) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium 1Tipp, 1 features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide 2, the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 4 and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 6 to be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8722;S&#8722;P five&#8208;membered ring (7) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Coordination Cage&#8208;Based Emulsifiers: Templated Formation of Metal Oxide Microcapsules Monitored by In Situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles captured in action: Non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly of heteroleptic coordination cages results in Gemini amphiphiles, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions. Serving as water&#8208;free medium, the emulsion&#8208;templated synthesis of metal oxide microcapsules from water&#8208;sensitive precursors can be carried out in controlled fashion. The formation of hollow metal oxide microcapsules was visualized by in&#8197;situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping.







Abstract
Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (CGA&#8208;3; CGA=Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques. In situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.

However, the potential of low-molecular bottom-up self-assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo-supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non-aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (&lt;b&gt;CGA-3&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;CGA&lt;/b&gt;=Cage-based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape-complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor-made polarity profile, able to stabilize non-aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane-in-DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water-sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid-liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques. In situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC-TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion-templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of p&#8208;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu  2  O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, while serious electron&#8208;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement of the PEC activity. In this work, CeO  2  nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the Cu  2  O octahedra surface, successfully constructing Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in which p&#8208;n heterojunction and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) structure work together. The optimum Cu  2  O/CeO  2  composite without the use of any cocatalyst exhibits 5 times higher photocurrent density (4.63 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu  2  O octahedra, which is better than most Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with the advanced Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu  2  O/CeO  2  (Faradaic efficiency of ~100%) is 17.5 times higher than that of pure Cu  2  O octahedra and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12 h stability test. The delicately designed Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;  iso  &#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesised and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 3  10  helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1 nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive  Monobridged Ge(&#181; &#8208;H)GeH Molecule via Non&#8208;Adiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH (X  1  A') molecule was prepared in gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium (Ge) with germane (GeH  4  ). Merged with electronic structure calculations, this reaction was revealed to commence on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond via a submerged barrier forming the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH  3  ); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH  3  predominantly isomerized via two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H  2  GeGe) and di&#8208;bridged (Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H  2  )Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of&#160;the cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C  2  H  2  surface, deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing non&#8208;classical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8211;stabilized perfluorinated palladium cages catalyze the additive&#8211;free aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8211;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8211;Pd  2+  coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8211;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd  2+  to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O  2  for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H  2  transfer to alkynes, which normally prevents from observing parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP). Nevertheless, specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled detection of important HCAT&#8208;alkyne&#8208;H  2  intermediates via substantial  1  H,  11  B and  15  N signal enhancements and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal-free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non-pairwise mechanism of H  2  transfer to alkynes, which normally prevents from observing parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP). Nevertheless, specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled detection of important HCAT-alkyne-H  2  intermediates via substantial  1  H,  11  B and  15  N signal enhancements and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The one&#8208;electron reduction reactions of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (  IF  ) with various alkali metals bring about the radical anion salts. The different structures and properties are characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and physical property measurement system (PPMS).

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Dynamics of Chiral Eight&#8208;Membered Cyclic Molecules with Thienylene and Cyclopropylene Units Alternately Connected</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclooligomerization of bifunctional monomers possessing triazolyl and vinyl groups at 2,3&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;positions on the thiophene ring is studied. Structurally interesting cyclic dimers in which thienylene and cyclopropylene units are alternately connected are obtained as the major components. The eight&#8208;membered rings in the center are non&#8208;planar and adopt a tub&#8208;shaped conformation. We also observe the phenomenon of racemization caused by a tub&#8208;to&#8208;tub ring&#8208;flipping, the activation energy of which is determined as 108 kJ mol  &#8208;1  by electronic circular dichroism spectra measurement.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;assisted Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides: The synergetic effect between plasmonic copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes from various sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, we loaded plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving the high yield of diaryl ethers. We believe that this study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically&#8208;sustainable process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>"Xenophilic" complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe&#160;two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8211;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8211;Fp (LX&#160;=&#160;b&#8208;aldiminate or&#160;b&#8208;diketim&#173;inate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into the Fe&#8211;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment.

         <dc:description>Potent main&#8208;group Lewis acids are capable of activating element&#8211;hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium&#8208; and borenium&#8208;ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform was designed. Abstraction of one hydride leads to a hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion rather than a hydrosilane&#8208;coordinated borenium ion paired with [B(C6F5)4]&#8211; or [HCB11Cl11]&#8211; as counteranions. Characterization by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction supported by DFT calculations reveals a cationic, unsymmetrical open three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (3c2e) Si&#8211;H&#8211;B linkage.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange&#8208;red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In case of orange&#8208;red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters. And the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange&#8208;red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra, therefore more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters based on molecular structures such as cyano benzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron based acceptors. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectrics in photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of industrialization and population brings water and air pollution and energy crisis. Solar driven catalysis is expected to relieve above issues. However, low efficiency of solar conversion limited by poor light harvesting and serious charge recombination of semiconductors and high surface reaction barriers is far from the satisfactory of industrial request. Ferroelectrics have been considered as promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO  3  , PbTiO  3  and LiNbO  3  , layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like BiFeO  3  , Bi  2  WO  6  , Bi  2  MoO  6  , etc. and other ferroelectrics have been introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method have been highlighted. Then, the research progress of ferroelectrics for photocatalysis has been summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO  2  reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts have been provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present a deep insight and guideline for the future research works of ferroelectrics  .</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Opening Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactam in Superacidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/  M  F  5  (  M  &#160;=&#160;Sb,&#160;As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8209;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]. In presence of water traces, the diprotonated species of  &#946;  &#8208;alanine [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, in case of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  , single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted. By using SO  2  instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NHSO][SbF  6  ]  2  was obtained, and a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from  N  &#8209;protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, and the MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, respectively, were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam.</dc:description>

         <title>Rearrangements in Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradation of herbicides by a plant nonheme iron dioxygenase: mechanism and selectivity of substrate analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogs by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C  2  &#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the  R  &#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.</dc:description>
