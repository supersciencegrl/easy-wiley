         <title>How Water and Ion Mobility Affect the NMR Fingerprints of the Hydrated JBW Zeolite: a Combined Computational&#8208;Experimental Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An important aspect within zeolite synthesis is to make fully tunable framework materials with controlled aluminium distribution. A major challenge in characterising these zeolites at operating conditions is the presence of water. In this work, we investigate the effect of hydration on the  27  Al NMR parameters of the ultracrystalline K,Na&#8208;compensated aluminosilicate JBW zeolite using experimental and computational techniques. The JBW framework, with Si/Al ratio of 1, is an ideal benchmark system as a stepping stone towards more complicated zeolites. The presence and mobility of water and extraframework species directly affect NMR fingerprints. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained provided dynamic methods are employed with hydrated structural models. This work shows how NMR is instrumental in characterising aluminium distributions in zeolites at operating conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the magnetic coupling in a Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II) Single Molecule Magnet</title>

Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8208;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0 K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g&#8208;factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [U  V  O  2  ]  +  is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g&#8208;factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component J Z twice larger as the perpendicular one J  &#8869;  . The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the J  Z  /J  &#8869;  ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g&#8208;factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding g  S  &#8208;values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8208;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [U  V  O  2  ]  +  5f orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible Light Absorption and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structuresfrom the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene with an Appropriate Oxygen Species as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based graphene with active oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser method. The laser&#8208;induced graphene shows a high catalytic performance in 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reactions to synthesize H2O2 including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1) in alkaline solution, superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. As demonstrated by density function theory simulations, the high catalytic sites are attributed to the meta&#8208;C atoms with charge accumulation at nearby C&#8722;O and O&#8722;C=O species.







Abstract
Oxygen species functionalized graphene (O&#8722;G) is an effective electrocatalyst for electrochemically synthesizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by a 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The type of oxygen species and degree of carbon crystallinity in O&#8722;G are two key factors for the high catalytic performance of the 2 e&#8722; ORR. However, the general preparing method of O&#8722;G by the precursor of graphite has the disadvantages of consuming massive strong oxidant and washing water. Herein, the biomass&#8208;based graphene with tunable oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser. In a flow cell setup, the laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and high mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1), superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density function theory demonstrates the meta&#8208;C atoms at nearby C&#8722;O, O&#8722;C=O species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H2O2 synthesis.

In a flow cell setup, the laser-induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and high mass activity (814&#8197;mmolg&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), superior to most of the reported carbon-based electrocatalysts. Density function theory demonstrates the meta-C atoms at nearby C&#8722;O, O&#8722;C=O species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
pKa values in non&#8208;aqueous solvents are of critical importance in many areas of chemistry. Our knowledge is, despite their relevance, still limited to the most fundamental properties and few pKa values in the most common solvents. Taking advantage of a recently introduced computationally efficient procedure we computed the pKa values of 182 compounds in 21 solvents. This data set is used to establish for the first time universal trends between all solvents. Our computations indicate, that the total charge of the molecule and the charge of the acidic group combined with the Kamlet&#8208;Taft solvatochromic parameters are sufficient to predict pKa values with at least semi&#8208; quantitative accuracy. We find, that neutral acids such as alcohols are strongly affected by the solvent properties. This is contrasted by cationic acids like ammonium ions whose pKa is often almost completely independent from the choice of solvent.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights about the Ligand&#8208;Enabled Oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of Alkenes via Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the mechanism of the oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of akenes catalyzed by gold. The way alkenols coordinate to (MeDalphos)Au(R&#8217;)2+ (R&#8217;=phenyl, vinyl) was found to significantly depend on their substitution pattern (terminal, Z/E internal) and to play a major role in the 5&#8208;exo/6&#8208;endo regioselectivity.







Abstract
The mechanism of oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of alkenes catalyzed by the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex was comprehensively investigated by DFT. (P,N)Au(Ph)2+ and (P,N)Au(vinyl)2+ are key intermediates accounting for the activation of the alkenols and for their cyclization by outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic attack of oxygen. The 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo paths have been computed and compared, reproducing the peculiar regioselectivity difference observed experimentally between 4&#8208;penten&#8208;1&#8208;ol, (E) and (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ols. Examining the way the alkenol coordinates to gold (more &#951;2 or &#951;1) can offer, in some cases, a simple way to predict the favored path of cyclization.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nano&#8208;Filamentous Zeolite Catalyst to Realize Efficient One&#8208;Step Ethanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile inhibitor&#8208;assisted strategy was developed for constructing nano&#8208;filamentous MOR catalyst, by which to achieve much higher STY of MA than the traditional ES&#8208;MOR catalyst in DME carbonylation [3780&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 1368&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)] and to realize more stable and efficient ethanol synthesis while being combined with an innovative self&#8208;reduced CZ/SiO2 catalyst.







Abstract
The non&#8208;petroleum synthesis route of ethanol from syngas (H2+CO) with methyl acetate (MA) as the core intermediate product has been confirmed as an excellent industrialization route for high purity ethanol production. However, as the central part of this tandem&#8208;catalysis path, the carbonylation of dimethyl ether (DME) to MA is limited by the undesirable catalytic activity and stability of zeolite catalysts. Herein, a facile inhibitor&#8208;assisted strategy was developed for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;Mordenite (nano&#8208;MOR) zeolites without using any expensive or complex template. A nano&#8208;filamentous MOR zeolite with only 70&#8197;nm crystal diameter was successfully synthesized by selectively controlling the crystal growth orientation with a specific inhibitor. The catalytic performance of self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR catalysts was remarkably outstanding in DME carbonylation reaction. The highest Space&#8208;Time Yield (STY) of MA was achieved over Nanofilament MOR (NF&#8208;MOR), which was significantly improved comparing with that of the traditional Ellipsoid&#8208;MOR (ES&#8208;MOR) [3780&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 1368&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)]. One&#8208;step ethanol synthesis was realized by combining the MOR catalyst and an innovative self&#8208;reduced Cu&#8208;ZnO/SiO2 (CZ/SiO2) catalyst in a rationally designed dual&#8208;bed catalysis system. Adopting the tailor&#8208;made NF&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ/SiO2 combination, it obtained the highest STY of ethanol, about 4 times of the conventional ES&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ combination [1800&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 476&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)]. The present self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR zeolites synthetic strategy opens a new way for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance zeolites for practical industrial applications in catalytic conversions of one&#8208;carbon (C1) small molecules to high value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Expanding Catch and Release DNA Decoy (CRDD) Technology with Pyrimidine Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the chemical toolbox: The toolbox of catch and release DNA decoys (CRDDs) has been expanded to pyrimidine mimics. CRDD technology uses photolysis to form abasic sites in DNA. This work shows that a 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) pyrimidine mimic undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond to yield an abasic site at a rate comparable to that of the previously reported 7&#8208;nitroindole (7&#8208;NI) purine mimic.







Abstract
Catch and release DNA decoys (CRDDs) utilize photochemically responsive nucleoside analogues that generate abasic sites upon exposure to light. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of four candidate CRDD monomers containing nucleobases that mimic endogenous pyrimidines: 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;NI), 2&#8208;nitrobenzene (2&#8208;NB), 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) and 3&#8208;nitropyrrole (3&#8208;NP). Our studies reveal that 2&#8208;NI and 2&#8208;NP can function as CRDDs, whereas 3&#8208;NP and 2&#8208;NB undergo decomposition and transformation to a higher&#8208;ordered structure upon photolysis, respectively. When incorporated into DNA, 2&#8208;NP undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond (1.8&#8197;min half&#8208;life) to yield an abasic site. Finally, we find that all four pyrimidine mimics show significantly greater stability when base&#8208;paired against the previously reported 7&#8208;nitroindole CRDD monomer. Our work marks the expansion of CRDD technology to both purine and pyrimidine scaffolds.

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 2&#8208;aminophenyl pyridines with a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond displays excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, as witnessed by their double emission profile. Their protonation or deprotonation modulates their emission properties, thereby making them promising for pH sensing applications.







Abstract
The dynamic nature of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and its effect on emission spectra is an attractive strategy to create multi&#8208;emissive dyes. Here we describe the behavior of a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded triphenylpyridines with a set of donor&#8211;acceptor combinations that allowed us to perceive the influence of each substitution on the photophysical properties of the dyes. The susceptibility of these ESIPT moieties to pH variations was also studied, elucidating that the level of protonation had a significant effect on the emission color. The assignment of each emission band was made by using DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations that were in agreement with the experimental results. This study emphasizes the versatility of triphenylpyridines that can be synthesized effortlessly with a logical and independent C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 substitution in order to have the desired ESIPT modulation and subsequent multi&#8208;emission response.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in the realization of various functions of human life such as fertilization, immune function, inflammatory response, regeneration process. Inspired by the natural chemotaxis, colloidal motors with chemotactic ability can realize intelligent sense and targeted navigation, which bring a revolutionary method to biomedical applications like precision medicine. However, the application in the biomedical field requires the colloidal motors with submicrometer scale, strong chemotactic ability and clear chemotactic mechanism. In this concept article, we introduce the recent progress of chemotactic colloidal motors, covering the fundamental theory behind experimental advancements. Particularly, the torque&#8208;driven reorientation motion of the submicrometer&#8208;sized colloidal motors during chemotaxis is discussed, and also their underlying mechanism is proposed. With the continuous research on chemotactic colloidal motors, it is believed that the emerging chemotactic colloidal motors will broaden practical applications in the biomedical field.</dc:description>

Treatment of  1  &#8208;  3  with NaPF  6  in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF  6  (PP = dppp (  1a  ), (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;Skewphos (  2a  ) and (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;Skewphos (  3a  )).

         <title>Enhancing Dual&#8208;State Emission in Maleimide Fluorophores through Fluorocarbon Functionalisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of trifluoroethyl substituted aminomaleimide derivatives are reported with small size and enhanced emissions in both solution and solid&#8208;state. A diCH2CF3 substituted aminochloromaleimide exhibits the most efficient dual&#8208;state emission (&#934;f &gt;50&#8201;% in solution and solid&#8208;state), with reduced quenching from protic solvents. Hence, these dual&#8208;state dyes overcome the limitations of single&#8208;state luminescence and will serve as an important step forward for this rapidly developing field.

         <title>Pyrimidopteridine&#8208;catalyzed Photo&#8208;mediated Hydroacetoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrimidopteridine organic photoredox catalysts are applied in a formal addition of carboxylic acids to activated alkenes as a dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalysts. Electron&#8208;rich alkenes counter the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids upon single&#8208;electron oxidation and a selective hydroacetoxylation is observed.







Abstract
Herein we report a photo&#8208;mediated formal addition of carboxylic acids to activated alkenes catalyzed by a pyrimidopteridine photoredox catalyst. The decarboxylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids upon single&#8208;electron oxidation is countered in the presence of electron&#8208;rich alkenes and a hydroacetoxylation is observed. Mechanistic proposals have been made based on CV measurements, competitive Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching and EPR experiments. Evidence that tetra&#8208;N&#8208;substituted pyrimidopteridines function as dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalyst was supported by spectroscopic means.

         <title>Macroscopic Polarization Change of Mononuclear Valence Tautomeric Cobalt Complexes Through the Use of Enantiopure Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize polarization change in non&#8208;ferroelectric crystals, valence tautomeric (VT) complexes with polar crystal structure were synthesized based on our strategy, i.&#8201;e. introduction of enantiopure ligand into the metal complexes exhibiting intramolecular electron transfer. The VT transition is accompanied by the change in molecular dipole moment. Because the net polarization of the polar crystal never cancels out, polarization switching was realized.







Abstract
The crystallization of a complex having electron transfer properties in a polar space group can induce the polarization switching of a crystal in a specific direction, which is attractive for the development of sensors, memory devices, and capacitors. Unfortunately, the probability of crystallization in a polar space group is usually low. Noticing that enantiopure compounds crystallize in Sohncke space groups, this paper reports a strategy for the molecular design of non&#8208;ferroelectric polarization switching crystals based on the use of intramolecular electron transfer and chirality. In addition, this paper describes the synthesis of a mononuclear valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complex bearing an enantiopure ligand. The introduction of enantiomer enables the crystallization of the complex in the polar space group (P21). The polarization of the crystals along the b&#8208;axis direction is not canceled out and the VT transition is accompanied by a change in the macroscopic polarization of the polar crystal. Polarization switching via electron transfer is realized at around room temperature.

         <title>Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl Derivatives and Related Analogs: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SF6 building blocks: This review article summarizes the recent synthetic methodology dedicated to pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and their related analogs. The properties and up&#8208;to&#8208;date applications in materials sciences and medicinal chemistry of SF5&#8208;containing compounds are also discussed here.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5)&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8722;F, and C&#8722;SF5 bond formation as well as the use of SF5&#8208;containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway&#8208;to&#8208;heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise&#8208;inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago. Herein, we report and evaluate the properties of the SF5 group and analogs, by summarizing synthetic methodologies available to access them as well as following applications in material science and medicinal chemistry since 2015.

         <title>Elastin&#8208;Hyaluronan Bioconjugate as Bioactive Component in Electrospun Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The persistence of &#945;&#8208;helix conformation in a bioactive peptide after the conjugation with hyaluronic acid confirms thiol&#8208;ene chemistry as a successful strategy adopting mild conditions. The electrospun scaffolds showed the double advantage of an improved regularity of nanofiber pattern by hyaluronic acid addition and the presence of a bioactive peptide.







Abstract
Hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan (HA) and elastin&#8208;inspired peptides (EL) have been widely recognized as bioinspired materials useful in biomedical applications. The aim of the present work is the production of electrospun scaffolds as wound dressing materials which would benefit from synergic action of the bioactivity of elastin peptides and the regenerative properties of hyaluronic acid. Taking advantage of thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, a bioactive elastin peptide was successfully conjugated to methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MAHA) and electrospun together with poly&#8208;D,L&#8208;lactide (PDLLA). To the best of our knowledge, limited reports on peptide&#8208;conjugated hyaluronic acid were described in literature, and none of these was employed for the production of electrospun scaffolds. The conformational studies carried out by Circular Dichroism (CD) on the bioconjugated compound confirmed the preservation of secondary structure of the peptide after conjugation while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the supramolecular structure of the electrospun scaffolds. Overall, the study demonstrates that the bioconjugation of hyaluronic acid with the elastin peptide improved the electrospinning processability with improved characteristics in terms of morphology of the final scaffolds.

         <title>Ferroelasticity in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics have got attention due to the superiority of structural adjustment, easy processing, and mechanical flexibility. Recent developments in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics and their crystal structures, phase transitions, and related properties with different dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) are discussed. An outlook on the possible challenges for obtaining hybrid perovskite ferroelastics is also presented.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelastics have received particular attention for potential applications in mechanical switches, shape memory, energy conversion, information processing, and solar cells, by taking advantages of their low&#8208;cost, light&#8208;weight, easy preparation, and mechanical flexibility. The unique structures of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be a design platform for symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;associated order&#8211;disorder in lattice, thereby possessing great potential for ferroelastic phase transition. Herein, we review the research progress of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics in recent years, focusing on the crystal structures, dimensions, phase transitions and ferroelastic properties. In view of the few reports on molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastics, we look forward to the structural design strategies of molecular ferroelastic materials, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastic materials in the future. This review will have positive guiding significance for the synthesis and future exploration of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid molecular ferroelastics.

         <title>Molecular Design of Silicon&#8208;Containing Diazenes: Absorbance of E and Z Isomers in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistable structures containing two silicon atoms (with any coordination number: III, IV, V) at the &#8722;N=N&#8722; fragment are characterized by the absorption of E and Z isomers in the near IR region and by a surprising separation of their first bands.







Abstract
The effective use of photochromic systems based on azo compounds in a number of applications, especially biomedical and pharmacological ones, is impeded by the unresolved problem of their E&#8646;Z isomerization in the near&#8208;IR region, NIR (780&#8211;1400&#8197;nm). We have demonstrated at the TD&#8208;DFT, STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD and CASSCF&#8208;NEVPT2 levels of theory that the presence of a silylated diazene core &#8722;Si&#8722;N=N&#8722;Si&#8722; with three&#8208;, tetra&#8208; or five&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms practically guarantees the absorption of the E and Z forms of such derivatives in NIR and the amazing (185&#8211;400&#8197;nm) separation of their first absorption bands. In particular, the maximum &#955;1 of the first n&#8594;&#960;* band of the E isomer of azosilabenzene ASiB is at &#8764;1030&#8197;nm, while for the Z isomer &#955;1&#8773;1340&#8197;nm. Based on the found bistable azo compounds (ASiB, bis(silyl)&#8208; SiD and bis(silatranyl)&#8208; SaD diazenes) and their derivatives with E and Z absorption in NIR, unique photoswitches can be created for a number of applications, in particular, for photothermal therapy.

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120 nm were produced intracellularly with an  Escherichia coli  &#8208;based  in vivo  system. The inCell&#8208;AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the  Lactobacillus brevis  alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the  Bacillus subtilis  glucose&#8208;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell&#8208;AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two&#8208;step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell&#8208;AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole&#8208;cell flow&#8208;biocatalysis, where flow reactors could be operated for &gt;4 days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell&#8208;AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one&#8208;step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Photocatalytic [2 + 2] Cycloaddition Reaction Using Redox&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of photocatalytic processes is important for a sustainable society. The electron transfer process is the key to the photocatalytic process. Herein, we focused on titanium dioxide photocatalyzed organic synthesis and designed a new [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction based on the electron transfer process. Electron transfer not only between the substrate and the photocatalyst but also inter&#8208; and intramolecularly, is an important consideration for reaction design. Radical cations were generated by the photocatalyst and trapped by alkenes. The resultant cyclobutyl radical cations were immediately reduced by the aryl rings via intramolecular electron transfer to obtain cyclobutane rings. The outcome of the reaction was controlled by substitution of the aryl ring and the linker connecting the aryl ring to the enol ether. Carefully&#8208;designed substrates were highly effective for photocatalytic cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An unprecedented, Brookhart&#8217;s acid catalyzed temperature switchable regioselective divergent approach for  N  &#8208;alkylation of arylamines and heterocyclic amines by utilising cyclopropylcarbinols is presented herein. The reaction offers  N  &#8208;alkylated cyclopropyl derivatives and homoallyl amines by employing 2.5 mol% catalyst loading at different temperatures in excellent regioselectivity and yields. This method has shown to be relevant with a wide range of cyclopropylcarbinols, including aliphatic ones. Several control experiments and spectroscopic studies have been performed to gain insight into the reaction mechanism. Further, the synthetic utility of the protocol has also been described.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;ligand Co&#8208;assembled 2D Au(I)&#8208;Thiolate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Au(I)&#8208;thiolate (AT) assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which show promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co&#8208;assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1&#8208;thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co&#8208;assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self&#8208;assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co&#8208;assembled by reacting with HAuCl  4  together to obtain three&#8208;ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co&#8208;assembly are also revealed by comparing single&#8208; and three&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co&#8208;assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely&#8208;packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and pave the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Restrictive Regulation of Ionic Liquid Quaternary Ammonium Salt in SBA&#8208;15 Pore Channel for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition reaction of CO  2  and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. Herein, a new type of catalysts SBA&#8208;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction was synthesized. The different amount of ionic liquid was added into SBA&#8208;15 by the post&#8208;grafting method, by which ionic liquid can be grafted into pore channel restrictively. SBA&#8208;Mn (0.2) (0.2 represented that the amount of ionic liquid is 0.2 mmol) with metal and halogen active sites into the pore channel showed high PC (propylene carbonate) yields and selectivity for five different epoxides at 90 &#176;C. Notably, SBA&#8208;Mn (0.2) has been demonstrated to maintain its catalytic activity and stability for over six cycles. Besides, we proposed a reaction mechanism for cycloaddition of CO  2  with epoxides by density&#8208;functional theory, showing that the metal was coordinated to oxygen atom of epoxide, and the halogen attacked the &#946; carbon of epoxide. Moreover, the theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy shows great potential for CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Coupling Reactions of Dinitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Mediated by Monometallic YB1&#8722;4&#8722; Anions: Carbon&#8722;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed coupling to form C&#8722;N bonds is significant in chemical science. However, the inert nature of N  2  and CO  2  renders their coupling quite challenging. Herein, we report the activation of dinitrogen in the mild plasma atmosphere by the gas&#8208;phase monometallic YB  1&#8722;4  &#8722;  anions and further coupling of CO  2  to form C&#8722;N bonds by using mass spectrometry and theoretical calculation. The observed product anions are NCNBO  &#8722;  and N(BO)  2  &#8722;  , accompanied by the formation of neutral products YO and YB  0&#8722;2  NC, respectively. We can tune the reactivity and the type of products by manipulating the number of B atoms. The B atoms in YB  1&#8722;4  N  2  &#8722;  act as electron donors in CO  2  reduction reactions, and the carbon atom originating from CO  2  serves as an electron reservoir. This is the first example of gas&#8208;phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N  2  with CO  2  &#160;through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

This is the first example of gas-phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N  2  with CO  2  &#160;through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Intramolecular C&#8722;H aminations via Engineered Heme Proteins: Full Reaction Pathways and Axial Ligand Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides the complete reaction pathway and axial ligand effect for heme protein catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H aminations. Results reproduced experimentally found rate&#8208;determining step and axial ligand trend and revealed the electronic driving force information to understand them. New ideas for biocatalyst design in this field were offered.







Abstract
Engineered heme protein biocatalysts provide an efficient and sustainable approach to develop amine&#8208;containing compounds through C&#8722;H amination. A quantum chemical study to reveal the complete heme catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H amination pathway and protein axial ligand effect was reported, using reactions of an experimentally used arylsulfonylazide with hemes containing L=none, SH&#8722;, MeO&#8722;, and MeOH to simulate no axial ligand, negatively charged Cys and Ser ligands, and a neutral ligand for comparison. Nitrene formation was found as the overall rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) and the catalyst with Ser ligand has the best reactivity, consistent with experimental reports. Both RDS and non&#8208;RDS (nitrene transfer) transition states follow the barrier trend of MeO&#8722;&lt;SH&#8722;&lt;MeOH&lt;None due to the charge donation capability of the axial ligand to influence the key charge transfer process as the electronic driving forces. Results also provide new ideas for future biocatalyst design with enhanced reactivities.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to HCOOH over Bismuth&#8208;Based Bromide Perovskites in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 reduction: Bismuth&#8208;based perovskites are utilized for CO2RR into formic acid in strong acid for the first time. The ingenious use of acidic electrolyte not only helps to stabilize the perovskite phase, but also enhances CO2 reduction rate, maintains a high OCHO* intermediate coverage and suppresses HER by avoiding the OH&#8722; and carbonate formation, addressing the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221; in CO2RR.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites, primarily used as optoelectronic devices, have not been applied for electrochemical conversion due to their insufficient stability in moisture. Herein, two bismuth&#8208;based perovskites are introduced as novel electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into HCOOH in aqueous acidic media (pH&#8197;2.5), exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH of &gt;80&#8201;% in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.25&#8197;V. Their structural evolution against water was dynamically monitored by in&#8197;situ spectra. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the formation of intermediate OCHO* on bismuth sites of Cs3Bi2Br9(111) play a pivotal role toward HCOOH production, which has a lower energy barrier than that on Cs2AgBiBr6(001) surfaces. Significantly, CO2 reacts with protons instead of water which can enhance CO2 reduction rate and suppress hydrogen evolution by avoiding carbonate formation in acidic electrolytes. This work paves the way for the extensive investigation of halide perovskites in aqueous systems.

         <title>In situ Grignard Metalation Method, Part II: Scope of the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Organocalcium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method is a powerful tool for the synthesis of Ca(hmds)2. Steric hindrance and side reactions occasionally prevent a straightforward application of this strategy but in these cases stoichiometric metalation reactions offer a way out.







Abstract
The in&#8197;situ Grignard Metalation Method (iGMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot strategy to synthesize alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides in multi&#8208;gram scale with high yields via addition of bromoethane to an ethereal suspension of a primary or secondary amine and magnesium (Part&#8197;I) or calcium (Part&#8197;II). This method is highly advantageous because no activation of calcium is required prior to the reaction. Contrary to the magnesium&#8208;based iGMM, there are some limitations, the most conspicuous one is the large influence of steric factors. The preparation of Ca(hmds)2 succeeds smoothly within a few hours with excellent yields opening the opportunity to prepare large amounts of this reagent. Side reactions and transfer of the iGMM to substituted anilines and N&#8208;heterocycles as well as other H&#8208;acidic substrates such as cyclopentadienes are studied. Bulky amidines cannot be converted directly to calcium amidinates via the iGMM but stoichiometric calciation with Ca(hmds)2 enables their preparation.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in the Ionothermal Synthesis for Nucleation of Crystalline Potassium Poly (heptazine imide) Towards an Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of NH4Cl in the eutectic salt mixture of KCl/LiCl can regulate the polymerization process and generate a potassium poly(heptazine imide) framework with favorable features, such as increased surface area, strengthened reduction power, improved exciton dissociation and charge migration properties, which contribute to a significantly boosted catalytic performance in photo&#8208;production of hydrogen peroxide from selective oxygen reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven selective oxygen reduction reaction on polymeric carbon nitride framework is one of the most promising approaches toward sustainable H2O2 production. Potassium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), with regular metal sites in the framework and favorable crystalline structure, is highly active for photocatalytic selective 2e oxygen reduction to produce H2O2. By introducing NH4Cl into the eutectic KCl&#8208;LiCl salt mixture, the PHI framework exhibits a remarkable performance for photocatalytic production of H2O2, for example, a record high H2O2 photo&#8208;production rate of 29.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1. The efficient photocatalytic performance is attributed to the favorable properties of the new PHI framework, such as improved porosity, negatively shifted LUMO position, enhanced exciton dissociation and charges migration properties. A mechanistic investigation by quenching and electron spin resonance technique reveals the critical role of superoxide radicals for the formation singlet oxygen, and the singlet oxygen is one of the critical intermediates towards the formation of the H2O2 by proton extraction from the ethanol.

Incorporated into a site&#8208;directing hexapeptide it can effectively probe the active site of PTP1B, yielding new phosphotyrosine mimetics derived from different nucleophiles, such as aryl amines (green).







Abstract
Discovery of protein&#8208;binding fragments for precisely defined binding sites is an unmet challenge to date. Herein, formylglycine is investigated as a molecular probe for the sensitive detection of fragments binding to a spatially defined protein site . Formylglycine peptide 3 was derived from a phosphotyrosine&#8208;containing peptide substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by replacing the phosphorylated amino acid with the reactive electrophile. Fragment ligation with formylglycine occurred in&#8197;situ in aqueous physiological buffer. Structures and kinetics were validated by NMR spectroscopy. Screening and hit validation revealed fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated hit fragments being able to replace the native phosphotyrosine residue. The formylglycine probe identified low&#8208;affinity fragments with high spatial resolution as substantiated by molecular modelling. The best fragment hit, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl&#8208;acetic acid, was converted into a cellularly active, nanomolar inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.

         <title>Construction of C&#8208;N Atropisomers by Aminocatalytic Enantioselective Addition of Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to o&#8208;Quinone Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
You (don't) spin me right &#8216;round, baby, right &#8216;round. A new organocatalytic atroposelective method for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The newly developed F&#8208;substituted aminocatalyst, with an increased outer&#8208;sphere steric control, enables the atroposelective formation of the desired product, which feature interesting biological motifs.







Abstract
The first atroposelective aminocatalytic methodology for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The synthesis of this class of axially chiral molecules typically encompasses substrates in which the C&#8722;N bond is pre&#8208;formed. In contrast, this work presents the direct coupling of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to ortho&#8208;quinones, to form the stereogenic C&#8722;N axis in an atroposelective way. Application of typical secondary amine catalysts furnished the desired product, however, in low yields and as a complex mixture arising from poor regiocontrol among the C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;sites of the indole core. A new aminocatalyst was designed and synthesized with increased outer&#8208;sphere steric bulk to address these challenges thereby providing good levels of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A novel library of functionalized and enantioenriched C&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained and their synthetic utility was demonstrated by various transformations.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Ni(0) and Ni(II) Complexes of Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene (MeBICAAC): Catalytic Activity and Mechanistic Insights in Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A wide range of aryl halides were coupled with phenylzinc bromides in Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction catalyzed by MeBICAAC&#8208;nickel complexes. The active species are deciphered by means of UV&#8208;vis, HRMS and NMR measurements and support the involvement of Ni(I)/Ni(III) species in the reaction promoted by [(MeBICAAC)2NiIICl2] pre&#8208;catalyst whereas, Ni(0)/Ni(II) cycle operates when the Ni(0) complex, [(MeBICAAC)2Ni0] was used as pre&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of organozinc compounds as nucleophiles with aryl halides has drawn immense focus for C&#8722;C bond formation reactions. In comparison to the well&#8208;established library of Pd complexes, the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling of this particular approach is largely primitive with nickel&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe the syntheses of Ni(II) complexes, [(MeBICAAC)2NiX2] (X=Cl (1), Br (2), and I (3)) by employing the bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (MeBICAAC) ligand. The reduction of complexes 1&#8211;3 using KC8 afforded the two coordinate low valent, Ni(0) complex, [(MeBICAAC)2Ni(0)] (4). Complexes 1&#8211;4 have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and their solid&#8208;state structures were also confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, complexes 1&#8211;4 have been applied in a direct and convenient method to catalyze the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of various aryl halides with 2,6&#8208;difluorophenylzinc bromide or phenylzinc bromide as the coupling partner in the presence of 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst. Comparatively, among all&#8208;pristine complexes, 1 exhibit high catalytic potential to afford value&#8208;added C&#8722;C coupled products without the use of any additive. The UV&#8208;vis studies and HRMS measurements of controlled stochiometric reactions vindicate the involvement of Ni(I)&#8722;NI(III) cycle featured with a penta&#8208;coordinated Ni(III)&#8208;aryl species as the key intermediate for 1 whereas Ni(0)/Ni(II) species are potentially involved in the catalytic cycle of 4.

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting of Black Silicon Photoanode with pH&#8208;Dependent Copper&#8208;Bipyridine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on black Si (b&#8208;Si) to improve its water splitting performance. Notably, b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with the lowest overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V and Tafel slop of 241&#8197;mV/dec at pH&#8197;11. Mechanism studies indicate that the formation of dimer complex at pH&#8197;11 could generate O&#8722;O bond via redox isomerization, resulting in low overpotential for efficient water oxidation.







Abstract
Since the water oxidation half&#8208;reaction requires the transfer of multi&#8208;electrons and the formation of O&#8722;O bond, it's crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si, b&#8208;Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5 VRHE at pH&#8197;11.0, which is dramatically improved from the b&#8208;Si photoanode (1.03&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2) and f&#8208;Si photoanode (0.0087&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Mechanism studies demonstrate that b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light&#8208;harvesting, interfacial charge&#8208;transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly, b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241&#8197;mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V at pH&#8197;11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH &#8764;11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl&#8208;complex could form O&#8722;O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Multistep Continuous Flow Synthesis of Isolable NH2&#8208;Sulfinamidines via Nucleophilic Addition to Transient Sulfurdiimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, are neglected S(IV) compounds. We report here the first synthesis of isolable NH2&#8208;sulfinamidines through a multistep continuous flow approach via addition of organometallics to a transient sulfurdiimide. The transformation is highly chemoselective and compatible with a variety of in&#8197;situ generated organolithiums. Further manipulation of the products gives access to unexplored S(IV) aza&#8208;analogues of pharmaceutically relevant targets.







Abstract
The growing interest in novel sulfur pharmacophores led to recent advances in the synthesis of some S(IV) and S(VI) motifs. However, preparation and isolation of uncommon primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, is highly desirable. Here we report a multistep continuous flow synthesis of poorly explored NH2&#8208;sulfinamidines by nucleophilic attack of organometallic reagents to in&#8197;situ prepared N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;N&#8208;trityl&#8208;&#955;4&#8208;sulfanediimine (Tr&#8722;N=S=N&#8722;TMS). The transformation can additionally be realized under mild conditions, at room temperature, via a highly chemoselective halogen&#8208;lithium exchange of aryl bromides and iodides with n&#8208;butyllithium. Moreover, the synthetic potential of the methodology was assessed by exploring further manipulations of the products and accessing novel S(IV) analogues of celecoxib, tasisulam, and relevant sulfinimidoylureas.

         <title>Encapsulated Neutral Ruthenium Catalyst for Substrate&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations performed on a neutral ruthenium complex immobilized inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric capsule showed that its formation is enabled by supramolecular interactions between the first coordination sphere of the ruthenium and the aromatic rings of the capsule. Substrate size selectivity was observed when the inclusion complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation of alcohols.







Abstract
The neutral complex dichloro&#8208;{diethyl[(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)&#8208;(4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;methylphenyl)methyl]phosphonate} (p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;ruthenium(II) was encapsulated inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric host obtained upon reaction of 2,8,14,20&#8208;tetra&#8208;undecyl&#8208;resorcin[4]arene and water. The formation of an inclusion complex was inferred from a combination of spectral measurements (MS, UV/Vis spectroscopy, 1H and DOSY NMR). The 31P and 19F NMR spectra are consistent with motions of the ruthenium complex inside the self&#8208;assembled capsule. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out on the inclusion complex confirmed these intra&#8208;cavity movements and highlighted possible supramolecular interactions between the ruthenium first coordination sphere ligands and the inner part (aromatic rings) of the capsule. The embedded ruthenium complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation (using NaIO4 as oxidant) of mixtures of three arylmethyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction kinetics were shown to vary as a function of the substrates&#8217; size, with the oxidation rate varying in the order benzylalcohol &gt;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzylalcohol &gt;9&#8208;anthracenemethanol. Control experiments realized in the absence of hexameric capsule did not allow any discrimination between the substrates.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Acrylate Synthesis from Carbon Dioxide and Ethylene by using a Guanidine&#8208;Based Pincer Ligand: Perturbing Occupied d&#8208;Orbitals by p&#960;&#8208;d&#960; Repulsion Makes a Difference</title>

         <dc:description>
Rhodium complexes bearing a guanidine based NCN pincer ligand were designed and successfully applied to catalytic acrylate synthesis from carbon dioxide and ethylene. The repulsion between p&#960;&#8208;electron of guanidine and filled d&#960; orbital of Rh center increases the electron density on Rh, allowing the first structural characterization of rhodalactone formation.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed acrylate synthesis from CO2 and ethylene was accomplished by using a guanidine&#8208;based NCN pincer ligand. The repulsion between p&#960;&#8208;electron of guanidine sidearms and occupied d&#960; orbital of rhodium center raised the level of d&#8208;electrons close to those of formerly known d8&#8208;ruthenium catalyst, thereby promoting the metallalactone formation from carbon dioxide and ethylene. This work fills the absence of group&#8208;9 metal based catalyst for the acrylate synthesis and provides a designing approach for pincer&#8208;ligated d8&#8208;metal catalysts to utilize p&#960;&#8208;d&#960; interaction for promoting desirable redox processes.

         <title>Leveraging Metal and Ligand Reactive Sites for One Pot Reactions: Ligand&#8208;Centered Borenium Ions for Tandem Catalysis with Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem catalysts that perform two different organic transformations in a single pot are highly desirable because they enable rapid and efficient assembly of simple organic building blocks into more complex molecules. Many examples of tandem catalysis rely on metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving one or more metal complexes. Remarkably, despite surging interest in the development of chemically reactive (i.e. noninnocent) ligands, there are few examples of metal complexes that leverage ligand&#8208;centered reactivity to perform catalytic reactions in tandem with separate catalytic reactions at the metal. Here we report how multifunctional Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;derived diphosphorus ligands, called TBDPhos, appear to facilitate borenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reactions at the ligand, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions at the metal. Both transformations can be accessed in one pot to afford rare examples of tandem catalysis using separate metal and ligand catalysis sites in a single complex.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2 A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1 V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self&#8208;powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70 &#956;s, which is the record value for MOF&#8208;based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000&#8208;time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF&#8208;based UV photodetector with anti&#8208;fatigue and anti&#8208;bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable Mn(I) Catalysts for Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Mechanistic, DFT and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic and DFT studies on a series of recyclable Mn(I) complexes disclosed six vital factors determining their activities along with the existence of different mechanisms for asymmetric direct and transfer hydrogenations. Moreover, Mn(I) complex 2&#8201;b (cat. loading: 0.4&#8208;1&#8197;mol%) performs base&#8208;free transfer hydrogenation of alkyl ketones ketones with enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process has been discovered for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover.







Abstract
We report here a mechanistic, DFT and catalytic study on a series of Mn(I) complexes 1, 2(a&#8211;d), 3, 4. The studies apprehended the requirements for Mn(I) complexes to be active in both asymmetric direct (AH) and transfer hydrogenations (ATH). The investigations disclosed 6 vital factors accelerating the formation of a resting species, which plays a significant role in lowering the activities of the Mn(I) complex 1 in ATH and AH, respectively. In addition, we also report here a base free Mn(I) catalyzed ATH of aryl alkyl ketones with high enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and improved activity. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover has been discovered. Notably, the studies provide evidence for the existence of two different temperature dependent mechanisms for AH and ATH, in contrast to previous studies on related systems.

         <title>Progress in Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on convergent paired electrolysis has been summarized in this concept article. Four strategies based upon metal catalysis, persistent radical effects, microfluidic chemistry, and alternating current electrolysis are discussed in relation to their underlying mechanisms.







Abstract
Convergent paired electrolysis combines both anodic and cathodic reactions simultaneously in an electrochemical transformation. It provides a highly energy&#8208;efficient and divergent approach to conventionally challenging and useful structures. However, the physical separation of the two half&#8208;electrode reactions makes it extremely difficult to couple the intermediates arising from the two electrodes. In this concept article, four strategies used in convergent paired electrolysis will be discussed from the perspective of the reaction mechanism: a) metal&#8208;catalyzed convergent paired electrolysis, b) convergent paired electrolysis enabled by persistent radical effects, c) microfluidic chemistry applied to convergent paired electrolysis, and d) alternating current electrolysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Proteins via a Bio&#8208;Inspired Copper(II)&#8208;Mediated Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Pydinecarboxaldehyde derivatives undergoes unique aldol reaction at the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins in the presence of a copper(II) salt under mild conditions. Peptides and proteins are readily modified with useful functional groups or reactive handles in a single step.







Abstract
The chemical modification of proteins is an effective technique for manipulating the properties and functions of proteins, and for creating protein&#8208;based materials. The N&#8208;terminus is a promising target for single&#8208;site modification that provides modified proteins with uniform structures and properties. In this paper, a copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction with 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PC) derivatives is proposed as an operationally simple method to selectively modify the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins at room temperature and physiological pH. The copper(II) ion activates the N&#8208;terminal amino acids by complexation with an imine of the N&#8208;terminal amino acid and 2&#8208;PCs, realizing the selective formation of the nucleophilic intermediate at the N&#8208;terminus. This results in a stable carbon&#8208;carbon bond between the 2&#8208;PCs and the &#945;&#8208;carbon of various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. The reaction is applied to four different proteins, including biopharmaceuticals such as filgrastim and trastuzumab. The modified trastuzumab retains the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 recognition activity.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Supported Potassium Hydride for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature desulfurization is developed based on graphite&#8208;supported potassium hydride. KH/C efficiently desulfurizes recalcitrant alkyl dibenzothiophenes, provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. In addition, KH/C enables ultra&#8208;deep desulfurization of sulfur heterocycles (&lt;3&#8197;ppm [S]).







Abstract
The industrial removal of organosulfur impurities from fossil fuels relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts in harsh conditions (ca. 400&#8201;&#176;C, up to 100&#8197;bar H2), yet desulfurization (DS) of refractory alkyl dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) remains challenging. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) enables efficient DS of DBTs in mild conditions, viz. &gt;97&#8201;% conversion of DBTs is achieved at 165&#8201;&#176;C in 3&#8211;6&#8197;h while the yields of respective biphenyls are 84&#8211;95&#8201;% by using only 15&#8201;% excess of KH per a C&#8722;S bond. In addition, KH/C allows to lower the concentration of 4,6&#8208;Me2DBT in the mesitylene solution from 1000&#8197;ppm to &lt;3&#8197;ppm (165&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;h) and provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. DS of various sulfur heterocycles by using KH/C, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free material based on earth abundant elements, is viable at low temperature and has prospects for the further development towards decentralized removal of organosulfur species from fossil fuels.

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystals of RuIII Complexes with Six Imidazole&#8208;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3](1) with six HIm (imidazole) was prepared so as to obtain a high&#8208;temperature proton conductor. The crystal is constructed through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#8722;H&#8208;bonds between the inter&#8208;RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic net without crystal anisotropy. The proton conductivity is due not only to rotations and hopping motions of HIm, but also induced by isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of 1.







Abstract
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] with three imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im&#8722;) groups was prepared to obtain a higher&#8208;temperature proton conductor than a Nafion membrane with water driving. The crystal is constructed by complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N H&#8208;bonds between the RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic network topology with a twofold interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton conductivity of 3.08&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 450&#8197;K and a faster conductivity than those formed by only HIms. The high proton conductivity is attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm frameworks that are activated at &#8764;113&#8197;K, but also isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] at temperatures greater than 420&#8197;K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and theoretically considered.

The crystal is constructed through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#8722;H-bonds between the inter-Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes and has a rare Icy-c* cubic net without crystal anisotropy. The proton conductivity is due not only to rotations and hopping motions of HIm, but also induced by isotropic whole-molecule rotation of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new H-bonded crystal [Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(Him)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Im)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] with three imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) groups was prepared to obtain a higher-temperature proton conductor than a Nafion membrane with water driving. The crystal is constructed by complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N H-bonds between the Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes and has a rare Icy-c* cubic network topology with a twofold interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton conductivity of 3.08&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 450&#8197;K and a faster conductivity than those formed by only HIms. The high proton conductivity is attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm frameworks that are activated at &#8764;113&#8197;K, but also isotropic whole-molecule rotation of [Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(Him)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Im)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] at temperatures greater than 420&#8197;K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid-state &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and theoretically considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Discrimination of Bacterial Drug Resistivity by Array&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Validation Using 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot the difference: A sensor array comprising cationic 2D MoS2 and GFP has been used to discriminate bacterial analytes. By using this optimized sensor array, bacteria and lysates belonging to different types and with different amounts of drug resistivity were successfully classified. Cross validation of blind samples through combined analysis of bacterial cell and lysates provided improved detection accuracy.







Abstract
The precise discrimination of microbes based on family, class and drug resistivity is essential for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. Information about the type and strength of drug resistivity can help the analyst to prescribe a suitable antibiotic at the proper dosage to completely eradicate microbes without giving them a chance to gain further resistance. Herein, we propose a sensor array based on the use of cationic two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 units and green fluorescence protein as building blocks. Cationic surfaces of receptors with various functionality were suitable for tunable interaction with anionic surfaces of microbes. The array successfully discriminates six different bacterial strains. The versatile ability of the receptors to bind with the wild&#8208;type as well as the corresponding ampicillin&#8208;resistant strain contributed significantly to rapid detection with high sensitivity. The optimized array was able to classify five different types and three different extents of drug&#8208;resistant variants of Escherichia coli by using bacteria cells and lysates. Finally, we have introduced the cross identification method using both bacteria cells and lysates and we found a great enhancement of detection in sensitivity and accuracy. This is the first report of this approach, which can be extended to many other methods for better accuracy in array&#8208;based detection.

         <title>Inducing Curvature to Pyracylene upon &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curve the flat! A reliable synthetic strategy for the &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds was established. The evolution of the structural, optoelectronic and redox properties in relation to the progressive &#960;&#8208;expansion was comprehensively studied both in experiment and theory. The results identify the compounds as promising chromophores with multi&#8208;stage amphoteric redox properties.







Abstract
We disclose a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds. The unique structural features of the resulting compounds were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Depending on the extent of &#960;&#8208;expansion the compounds display intense bathochromically shifted absorption bands in their UV/Vis spectra and are prone to several redox events as documented by cyclic voltammetry. The experimental observations are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory, suggesting progressive narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and distinct evolution of the electronic structure and aromaticity.

         <title>Synthesis of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) Complexes and Their Use as Precatalysts for the Activator&#8208;Free, Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Carboxylic Acids to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable synthetic N&#8722;H metalation route to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes bearing backbone&#8208;modified (and classical) NHC ligands, carbazole and amines is presented. The CMAs are employed for the first time as precatalysts in the inter&#8208; and intramolecular addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes.







Abstract
A straightforward synthetic protocol leading to carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amido (CMA) complexes (metal=Au, Cu) using a mild base and an environmentally desirable solvent (EtOH) has been explored, with a focus on complexes bearing backbone&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, including BIAN&#8208;NHCs (BIAN=bis(imino)acenaphthene). The novel CMAs were structurally characterized, and gold&#8208;based CMAs bearing diverse NHCs were screened as simple, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;basic precatalysts. The readily accessible complexes display high catalytic activity in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes and alkynoic acids respectively, while the screening reveals the ancillary ligand effect of NHCs in these catalytic systems.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity is in the Details: Minor Changes Yield Major Improvements to the Synthesis of Bedaquiline
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bedaquiline fumarate is a crucial drug for treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis. Improvements to the industrial synthesis are reported here that affords racemic bedaquiline in yields twice as high as those reported in patents, presenting an opportunity to dramatically improve the affordability of this drug. Close attention to reaction mechanism informed optimization of this synthesis by providing rationale for operational controls and reaction parameters that influence yield and diastereoselectivity in surprising ways.







Abstract
Bedaquiline is a crucial medicine in the global fight against tuberculosis, yet its high price places it out of reach for many patients. Herein, we describe improvements to the key industrial lithiation&#8208;addition sequence that enable a higher yielding and therefore more economical synthesis of bedaquiline. Prioritization of mechanistic understanding and multi&#8208;lab reproducibility led to optimized reaction conditions that feature an unusual base&#8208;salt pairing and afford a doubling of the yield of racemic bedaquiline. We anticipate that implementation of these improvements on manufacturing scale will be facile, thereby substantially increasing the accessibility of this essential medication.

         <dc:description>
Tellurium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding catalysts successfully activate a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition with catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%, with different substrates, and in different solvents. Furthermore, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were introduced and tested in this reaction, but only racemic mixtures of the product were obtained.







Abstract
Recently, chalcogen bonding has been investigated in more detail in organocatalysis and the scope of activated functionalities continues to increase. Herein, the activation of imines in a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with bidentate cationic chalcogen bond donors is presented. Tellurium&#8208;based Lewis acids show superior properties compared to selenium&#8208;based catalysts and inactive sulfur&#8208;based analogues. The catalytic activity of the chalcogen bonding donors increases with weaker binding anions. Triflate, however, is not suitable due to its participation in the catalytic pathway. A solvent screening revealed a more efficient activation in less polar solvents and a pronounced effect of solvent (and catalyst) on endo&#8201;:&#8201;exo diastereomeric ratio. Finally, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were applied but provided only racemic mixtures of the product.

         <title>Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;Pyrroles from Ketones, Aldehydes, and Nitro Alkanes via Hydrogenative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst has been developed and employed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via hydrogenation and subsequent cyclization of nitro ketones. The catalyst was identified from a library of 24 heterogeneous catalysts. The key to our hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is the tolerance of aldehydes and ketones as functional groups and the ability to hydrogenate aliphatic nitro compounds efficiently.







Abstract
Syntheses of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds that permit a flexible introduction of various substitution patterns by using inexpensive and diversely available starting materials are highly desirable. Easy to handle and reusable catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are especially attractive for these syntheses. We report here on the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via the hydrogenation and cyclization of nitro ketones. The latter are easily accessible from three components: a ketone, an aldehyde and a nitroalkane. Our reaction has a broad scope and 23 of the 33 products synthesized are compounds which have not yet been reported. The key to the general hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is a highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst, which was identified from a library of 24 earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Syntheses of Alkylidenecyclopropanes from Allenoates with Donor&#8208;Acceptor and Diacceptor Diazo Reagents</title>

Chiral ACPs: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alkylidenecyclopropanes from electron&#8208;deficient allenes is described. The methodology, using donor&#8208;acceptor or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex furnished the corresponding ACPs in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The first diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient allenes with donor&#8208;acceptor and diacceptor diazo reagents are described. The desired enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of Rh2((S)&#8208;TCPTAD)4 or Rh2((R)&#8208;BTPCP)4 catalysts (up to 95&#8201;% yield, &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 d.r. and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.). This methodology gave a direct access to ACPs bearing multiple electron&#8208;deficient substituents and allows to further expand the availability of ACPs chemistry. Interestingly, during the examination of the scope of this reaction, the asymmetric intramolecular C&#8722;H insertion reaction into tert&#8208;butyl group was observed as a side reaction with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.

         <title>Fluorescent P&#8208;Hydroxyphosphole for Peptide Labeling through P&#8208;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of new P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide and &#8208;sulfide based fluorophores exhibiting large Stokes shifts, and their coupling to biomolecules through the formation of P&#8722;N bond is presented herein. The fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide was coupled to a ghrelin receptor (GHSR) antagonist and the binding of the conjugates was highlighted by F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).







Abstract
Synthesis of fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide was achieved by trapping a binaphtyl dianion with methyl dichlorophosphite or P&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)dichlorophosphine, followed by oxidation or sulfuration of the P&#8208;center. After saponification or acid hydrolysis, the P&#8208;hydroxyphospholes were coupled to peptides using the coupling agent BOP, under the conditions required for the synthesis in solution or on a solid support. This new method was illustrated by the labeling of the JMV2959, a potent antagonist of the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor type 1a (GHS&#8722;R1a). The labeled conjugates were used to characterize GHSR ligands by competition assays, based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Such P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide constitute a promising new class of compact fluorophores with large Stokes shift, for labeling biomolecules by grafting through the phosphorus atom.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Unsaturated Hydrocarbon Chains through C&#8722;S Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;S activation is used in a surface&#8208;supported reaction to create a reticulated network of conjugated hydrocarbon chains on Cu(111). The reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and the product is characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We use an on&#8208;surface synthesis approach to drive the homocoupling reaction of a simple dithiophenyl&#8208;functionalized precursor on Cu(111). The C&#8722;S activation reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and yields unsaturated hydrocarbon chains interconnected in a fully conjugated reticulated network. High&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy imaging reveals the opening of the thiophenyl rings and the presence of trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;oligoacetylene chains as well as pentalene units. The chemical transformations were studied by C 1s and S 2p core level photoemission spectroscopy and supported by theoretical calculations. At higher annealing temperature, additional cyclization reactions take place, leading to the formation of small graphene flakes.

         <dc:description>
An entirely new displacement system based on anomeric DNA without toehold was designed and its applicability was demonstrated. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. During displacement strand orientation changed from antiparallel in &#946;&#8208;D DNA to parallel in &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D DNA and back to antiparallel in &#945;/&#945;&#8208;D DNA. Reaction progress was visualized by fluorescence change using the intercalator ethidium bromide as sensor.







Abstract
DNA strand displacement is a technique to exchange one strand of a double stranded DNA by another strand (invader). It is an isothermal, enzyme free method driven by single stranded overhangs (toeholds) and is employed in DNA amplification, mismatch detection and nanotechnology. We discovered that anomeric (&#945;/&#946;) DNA can be used for heterochiral strand displacement. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. Single stranded &#945;&#8208;D DNA acts as invader. Herein, new anomeric displacement systems with and without toeholds were designed. Due to their resistance against enzymatic degradation, the systems are applicable to living cells. The light&#8208;up intercalator ethidium bromide is used as fluorescence sensor to follow the progress of displacement. Anomeric DNA displacement shows benefits over canonical DNA in view of toehold free displacement and simple detection by ethidium bromide.

         <title>Autotuning of Vibrational Strong Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actuatable Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavities allow site&#8208;selective organic reaction under vibrational strong coupling. The piezoelectric actuators with a computer&#8208;controlled feedback loop are installed in the FP cavity, which enables accurate retuning of the cavity mode in response to refractive index changes within the cavity. Thanks to the autotuning of cavity mode, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved, despite the respective reactive carbonyl stretches being energetically close.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemistry opens new paths for the synthesis of technologically important molecules. When a reactant is placed inside a Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavity, energy exchange between molecular vibrations and resonant cavity photons results in vibrational strong coupling (VSC). VSC has recently been implicated in modified chemical reactivity at specific reactive sites. However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50&#8201;% improvement in site&#8208;selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.

         <title>Front Cover: Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystals of RuIII Complexes with Six Imidazole&#8208;Imidazolate Ligands (Chem. Eur. J. 47/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
The crystals of [RuIII(HIm)3(Im)3](1) are one of the rapid proton&#8208;transport materials to work as proton conductors at high temperatures. The proton flow is caused by the strong rotations of Im&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;Im H&#8208;bonding imidazole groups from 200&#8197;K. In the upper left image, as the temperature increases to 400&#8197;K, six coordinated imidazole groups are strongly rotating to transport protons. In the lower right image, whole&#8208;molecule rotations start becoming the main rotation above 400&#8197;K. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;Tadokoro et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201397).

Like in the novella by Antoine de Saint&#8208;Exup&#233;ry where the narrator has difficulties drawing a sheep when asked by the Little Prince, anyone asked to draw a carbon dot knows to proceed with caution. An object which seems trivial is in fact far more complex when you need to draw an accurate picture. For more information, see the Review by X. Li, J. Claverie and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Carbon Dots for Carbon Dummies: The Quantum and The Molecular Questions Among Some Others</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 47, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite almost 20&#8201;years of intensive research on carbon dots (CDs), their actual nature remains obscure. This review aims at summarizing facts and conclusions from literature as well as bringing critical perspectives on the alleged quantum or molecular nature of CDs.







Abstract
Carbon Dots (CDs) are carbon nanoparticles which were discovered in 2004. Despite two decades of intensive work from the scientific community and a colossal amount of gathered experimental data, no definitive consensus exists to date on several key aspects such as the actual definition of CDs and the origin of their emissive properties. This review proposes a critical evaluation of these fundamental questions. Lay persons will also find here an alternative introduction to the CDs domain, including synthetic strategies, photophysical properties, as well as challenges and outlook of this exciting new area.

&#8220;The resulting single molecular crystal shows excellent proton conductivity even at temperatures as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C. Then, the proton transport mechanisms in the high temperature region are not only clarified on heavy rotations of individual six imidazole groups, but also whole molecular rotation becomes the main one above 130&#8201;&#176;C.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201397).

         <title>Experimental and Computational Insights on the Influence of Organic Co&#8208;solvent on Structural and Catalytic Properties of a Biocatalyst: Inhibitory Effect of DMSO on Halohydrin Dehalogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the application of organic solvents in biocatalysis is well explored, in&#8208;depth understanding of solvent interactions with proteins, in particular oligomeric ones, is still scant. Understanding of these interactions is essential in tailoring enzymes for industrially relevant catalysis in nonaqueous media. In our study, homotetrameric enzyme halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from  Agrobacterium radiobacter  AD1 (HheC) was investigated, as a model system, in DMSO&#8208;water solvent mixtures. DMSO, the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent for biocatalytic transformations, was found to act as a mixed&#8208;type inhibitor with a prevalent competitive contribution. Already 5% (v/v) DMSO inhibits the activity of HheC by half. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that DMSO keeps close to Ser&#8208;Tyr catalytic residues forming alternate H&#8208;bonds with them. Stability measurements paired with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS) methods and MD studies revealed that HheC conserves structural integrity in content as high as 30% (v/v) DMSO.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding materials properties. This characteristic relies on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN 6 octahedra frameworks being particularly intriguing. In this study, the phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen system was studied up to 137 GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 and PN 2 were found to form at 72 and 134 GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN 6 units. The two are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K 0 = 322 GPa for &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 and of K 0 = 339 GPa for PN 2 . Upon decompression below 7 GPa, &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P 3 N 5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN 4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P 3 N 5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through high&#8208;pressure formed phases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel Pd&#8208;catalysed oxidative coupling between benzoic acids and vinylarenes or acrylates to furnish isocoumarins and phtalides is reported. The reaction proceeds smoothly in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate  via  a selective C&#8208;H bond activation, with very low percentage of ligand&#8208;free palladium acetate as the catalyst, under atmospheric pressure of oxygen. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of copper acetate is also required as a reoxidant for the palladium.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith Reaction: History, Strategies, and Synthetic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical ring rearrangements (RRR): The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals, is an important strategy in organic synthesis to rapidly access medium&#8208;sized rings that are present in several natural products and valuable pharmaceutical compounds. This Review article discusses the origin and advancement of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction with particular focus on its application to complex natural products synthesis.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;expansion strategies are valuable synthetic tools that take benefit of existing ring structures and evade the unfavorable enthalpic&#8208;and entropic effects that arise with end&#8208;to&#8208;end cyclizations. One potentially important class of such reactions is the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, the ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals. The exciting advancement in this research area is starting to show its potential, as demonstrated by applying this methodology in strategy&#8208;level bond formation to synthesize complex natural products. This Review aims to provide the first comprehensive survey of the development of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction spanning three decades from the initial report to the present day, thus providing the readers with great detail about the contributions of this reaction to organic synthesis. We hope that this review will further disclose the salient features of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction for synthetic applications and encourage the development of new, more advanced applications.

         <title>An Iodide&#8208;Mediated Anodic Amide Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and robust methodology towards a direct condensation of carboxylic acids and amines has been realized in a versatile electrochemical approach, using a combination of triphenylphosphine and iodide as coupling reagent. A broad scope of different amides and dipeptides were accessible by the presented method, without the need for pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting materials.







Abstract
The ubiquity of amide bonds, present in natural products and common pharmaceuticals renders this functional group one of the most prevalent in organic chemistry. Despite its importance and a wide variety of existing methods for its formation, the latter still can be a challenge for classical activating reagents such as chloridating agents or carbodiimides. As the spent reagents often cannot be recycled, the development of more sustainable methods is highly desirable. Herein, we report an operationally simple and mild indirect electrochemical protocol to effect the condensation of carboxylic acids with amines, forming a wide variety of carboxamides.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Recognition by DARPIns through Epitope/Paratope Analogy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DARPins are proteins able to specifically recognize G&#8208;quadruplexes. Their small size combined with their easy design makes them a good competitor to antibodies for the identification and localization of G&#8208;quadruplex. Using molecular dynamics calculations, we show that the selectivity of DARPins towards G&#8208;quadruplexes is achieved by the recognition of a structural motif adopted by the DNA filament folding.







Abstract
We investigated the mechanisms leading to the specific recognition of Guanine Guadruplex (G4) by DARPins peptides, which can lead to the design of G4&#8197;s specific sensors. To this end we carried out all&#8208;atom molecular dynamic simulations to unravel the interactions between specific nucleic acids, including human&#8208;telomeric (h&#8208;telo), Bcl&#8208;2, and c&#8208;Myc, with different peptides, forming a DARPin/G4 complex. By comparing the sequences of DARPin with that of a peptide known for its high affinity for c&#8208;Myc, we show that the recognition cannot be ascribed to sequence similarity but, instead, depends on the complementarity between the three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of the molecular fragments involved: the &#945;&#8208;helix/loops domain of DARPin and the G4 backbone. Our results reveal that DARPins tertiary structure presents a charged hollow region in which G4 can be hosted, thus the more complementary the structural shapes, the more stable the interaction.

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Targeting Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Photodynamic Molecular Beacon for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photodynamic molecular beacon has been designed and synthesized, which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton which is activatable by the coexistence of glutathione and cathepsin B. It serves as a tumor&#8208;targeting and dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photosensitizer for precise photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
A multifunctional photodynamic molecular beacon (PMB) has been designed and synthesized which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton in which the three zinc(II) phthalocyanine units are each substituted with a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) quencher and are linked via two cathepsin B&#8208;cleavable GFLG peptide chains. This tailor&#8208;made conjugate is fully quenched in the native form due to the photoinduced electron transfer effect of the DNBS moieties and the self&#8208;quenching of the phthalocyanine units. It can target the EGFR overexpressed in cancer cells, and after receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, it can be activated selectively by the co&#8208;existence of intracellular GSH and cathepsin B, both of which are also overproduced in cancer cells, in terms of fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation. The cell&#8208;selective behavior of this PMB has been demonstrated using a range of cancer cells with different expression levels of EGFR, while the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been studied both in&#8197;vitro and in various aqueous media. The overall results show that this advanced PMB, which exhibits several levels of control of the tumor specificity, is a promising photosensitizer for precise antitumoral photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Bonding Situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H Complexes in Transition Metal and Main Group Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controversial bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E=Si, B) complexes in transition metal and main&#8208;group compounds is quantitatively analyzed by means of computational tools. This study sheds light on the crucial role of backdonation to determine the possible &#951;1 or &#951;2 coordination modes.







Abstract
The ambiguous bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E=Si, B) complexes in transition metal compounds has been rationalized by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, the combination of the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) method and its Natural Orbital for Chemical Valance (NOCV) extension has been applied to representative complexes described in the literature where the possible &#951;1 versus &#951;2 coordination mode is not unambiguously defined. Our quantitative analyses, which complement previous data based on the application of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approach, indicate that there exists a continuum between genuine &#951;1 and &#951;2 modes depending mainly on the strength of the backdonation. Finally, we also applied this EDA&#8208;NOCV approach to related main&#8208;group species where the backdonation is minimal.

To this end, the combination of the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) method and its Natural Orbital for Chemical Valance (NOCV) extension has been applied to representative complexes described in the literature where the possible &#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; versus &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode is not unambiguously defined. Our quantitative analyses, which complement previous data based on the application of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approach, indicate that there exists a continuum between genuine &#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modes depending mainly on the strength of the backdonation. Finally, we also applied this EDA-NOCV approach to related main-group species where the backdonation is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One Fluorophore&#8208;Two Sensing Films: Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Directed Formation of a Quadruple Perylene Bisimide Stack</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;one fluorophore&#8208;two sensing films&#8221; is realized based on a typically designed perylene bisimide dimer, HDPP&#8208;PBI, which shows strong tendency to form quadruple PBI aggregate via dimerization in suitable solvents owing to synergistic effect between intramolecular hydrogen bond formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Transition from fluorescence silent HDPP&#8208;PBI dimer to fluorescence bright monomer is realized via addition of CF3COOH.







Abstract
Elaborately designed &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular aggregates are significant for modulation of photophysical properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Herein, a double hydrogen&#8208;bonds trussed di(pyridyl)pyrrole&#8208;perylene bisimide (HDPP&#8208;PBI) was designed and its dimerization behavior was studied. HDPP&#8208;PBI tends to form a quadruple PBI stack with a dimerization constant of &#8764;5.56&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The dimerization was ascribed to synergistic intramolecular double hydrogen&#8208;bonds formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Addition of CF3COOH, a hydrogen bond blocker, promotes the dimer to monomer transition. Accordingly, two distinct fluorescent films were prepared by drop&#8208;casting of the dimerized or the monomeric HDPP&#8208;PBI onto a substrate surface. Interestingly, the less&#8208;emissive PBI quadruple stack&#8208;based film showed a turn on response to acetone vapor, while the highly emissive HDPP&#8208;PBI&#8208;based film exhibited fluorescence quenching upon exposure to triethylamine vapor. We believe that the discovered synergistic effect in the PBI aggregates would enlighten the design of new PAHs aggregates with defined structures.

         <title>Structure of Zinc and Nickel Histidine Complexes in Solution Revealed by Molecular Dynamics and Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman optical activity (ROA) is rarely applied to metals because of the complexity of the spectra. However, herein, it was possible to analyze model zinc and nickel compounds and determine prevalent trends in the structure. Correct interpretation of the spectra opens a way to application of this kind of spectroscopy to biologically relevant systems in the natural aqueous environment.







Abstract
The histidine residue has an exceptional affinity for metals, but solution structure of its complexes are difficult to study. For zinc and nickel complexes, Raman and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopy methods to investigate the link between spectral shapes and the geometry were used. The spectra were recorded and interpreted on the basis of ionic equilibria, molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory. For zwitterionic histidine the dominant tautomer was determined by the decomposition of experimental spectra into calculated subspectra. An octahedral structure was found to prevail for the ZnHis2 complex in solution, in contrast to a tetrahedral arrangement in the crystal phase. The solution geometry of NiHis2 is more similar to the octahedral structure found by X&#8208;ray. The Raman and ROA structural determinations of metal complexes are dependent on extensive computations, but reveal unique information about the studied systems.

         <title>Reversible Oxidative Addition of Zinc Hydride at a Gallium(I)&#8208;Centre: Labile Mono&#8208; and Bis(hydridogallyl)zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc dihydride reacts with a gallium(I) reagent by reversible oxidative addition to provide di&#8208; and trimetallic hydridogallyl zinc complexes. The position of oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination equilibria can be controlled by coordination/decoordination of TMEDA.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), partially deaggregated zinc dihydride as hydrocarbon suspensions react with the gallium(I) compound [(BDI)Ga] (I, BDI={HC(C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3))2}&#8722;) by formal oxidative addition of a Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centre. Dissociation of the labile TMEDA ligand in the resulting complex [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (1) facilitates insertion of a second equiv. of I into the remaining Zn&#8722;H to form a thermally sensitive trinuclear species [{(BDI)Ga(H)}2Zn] (2). Compound 1 exchanges with polymeric zinc dideuteride [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA, and with compounds I and 2 via sequential and reversible ligand dissociation and gallium(I) insertion. Spectroscopic and computational studies demonstrate the reversibility of oxidative addition of each Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centres.

Partial ligand substitution in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 through solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange by BDC enhances the photo&#8208;generated charge separation, which promotes the hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times higher hydrogen production rate compared to the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This work broadens the field of ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Conjugated Dienes: Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of Piperazines and 2&#8208;Piperazinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of conjugated dienes has been developed using ethanediamine and &#945;&#8208;amino amide derivatives as nitrogen sources respectively. A variety of valuable substituted piperazines and 2&#8208;piperazinones were synthesized in good yields and with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Dinitrogen heterocycles are among the most important molecular structures, and the synthesis of these types of structures through intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins is a direct and efficient method.

         <title>Discovery of Complex Binding and Reaction Mechanisms from Ternary Gases in Rare Earth Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) calculations were carried out for H2O, NO2 and SO2 gas mixtures in rare earth (Y, Eu, Tb and Yb) 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterepthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. The results reveal formation of secondary gases inside the MOF pore and the identification of four unique adsorption sites.







Abstract
Understanding the selectivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to complex acid gas streams will enable their use in industrial applications. Herein, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) were used to simulate ternary gas mixtures (H2O&#8208;NO2&#8208;SO2)&#160;in rare earth 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. Stronger H2O gas&#8208;metal binding arose from thermal vibrations in the MOF sterically hindering access of SO2 and NO2 molecules to the metal sites. Gas&#8208;gas and gas&#8208;linker interactions within the MOF framework resulted in the formation of multiple secondary gas species including HONO, HNO2, NOSO, and HNO3&#8722;. Four gas adsorption sites were identified along with a new de&#8208;protonation reaction mechanism not observable through experiment. This study not only provides valuable information on competitive gas binding energies in the MOF, it also provides important chemical insights into transient chemical reactions and mechanisms.

         <title>Efficient Water Cleaning by Self&#8208;standing Carbon Nitride Films Derived from Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;standing carbon nitride films were prepared by drying and calcinating tailored supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and 4&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid. The resulting self&#8208;standing films were employed as filters combining adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants showing remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions.







Abstract
The design of efficient self&#8208;standing hybrid systems for water purification that combines good adsorption properties with high photodegradation ability is highly challenging owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the band structure and porosity of a semiconductor while maintaining its self&#8208;standing nature. Here, we report the synthesis of carbon&#8208;rich carbon nitride self&#8208;standing filters from supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and cyanobenzoic acid. The influence of the chemical structure on the properties of the hydrogels and the final films was studied by tuning parameters such as monomer nature, molar ratio, and pyrolysis temperature. Thanks to their ability to combine the adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants, the prepared self&#8208;standing films showed remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions (&gt;95&#8201;% efficiency after 10&#8197;consecutive cycles). Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of the films was assessed in the powder form for the hydrogen evolution reaction and photocurrent generation in a photoelectrochemical cell. The reported work opens opportunities for the controlled synthesis of multifunctional filters for water purification and other energy&#8208;related and sustainable technologies.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Variation and Sodium Storage Behavior of Polyoxometalates Encapsulated within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confining polyoxometalates (POMs) in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) influence the electronic structure of POMs. Electron transfer occurs not only between POMs and SWNTs, but also within a single POM cluster. Consequently, charge density on the bridged oxygen of POMs is prominently enhanced. The electron reconfiguration of POMs in POMs@SWNT significantly accelerate electron and ion transport, and improve electrochemical Na+ storage performance.







Abstract
The host&#8211;guest interaction can remarkably alter the physiochemical properties of composite materials. It is crucial to clarify the mechanism by revealing the influence of the host on the electronic structure of the guest molecules. Herein, we study the structural variation of polyoxometalates (POMs) after being confined in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). What we found is that in addition to the reported charge transfer from SWNT to POM, an intramolecular electron transfer within a single POM cluster can be observed in the POM@SWNT composites. Moreover, the charge density on the bridged oxygen of POMs is prominently enhanced. The structural change and electron reconfiguration of POMs upon encapsulation in SWNT significantly speed up electron and ion transport, leading to the improved electrochemical performance for sodium ions storage.

         <title>In Situ Ternary Adduct Formation of Yttrium Polyaminocarboxylates Leads to Small Molecule Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8197;situ formation of ternary adducts of yttrium(III) polyaminocarboxylate complexes with the endogenous molecules pyruvate, bicarbonate or acetate are investigated using 13C&#8197;NMR, SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised NMR, and DFT. A novel [Y(EDTA)(pyruvate hydrate)(H2O)]2&#8722; adduct is linked to decomposition of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO2 highlighting the potential of these adducts for capture and activation of small molecules.







Abstract
In this work the chemistry of yttrium complexes is exploited for small molecule capture and activation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies were used to investigate the in&#8197;situ formation of solution state ternary yttrium&#8208;acetate, yttrium&#8208;bicarbonate, and yttrium&#8208;pyruvate adducts with a range of polyaminocarboxylate chelates. These studies reveal that [Y(DO3A)(H2O)2] (H3DO3A &#8211; 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;tricarboxylic acid) and [Y(EDTA)(H2O)q]&#8722; (H4EDTA &#8211; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, q = 2 and 3) are able to form ternary adducts with bicarbonate and pyruvate. In the latter, unusual decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO2 was observed and further studied using SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised 13C&#8197;NMR (SABRE &#8211; signal amplification by reversible exchange) to provide information about the reaction timescale and lifetime of intermediates involved in this conversion. The work presented demonstrates that yttrium complexes can capture and activate small molecules, which may lead to novel and useful applications of this metal in catalysis and medical imaging.

         <title>Advanced and Designing Strategies in Polymeric Antifungal Agents Inspired by Membrane&#8208;Active Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;mortality invasive fungal infections seriously threaten the lives of immunocompromised people. Host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are representative membrane&#8208;active peptides with different functions. Among them, host defense peptides mimicking is a valid strategy in the design of synthetic antifungal agents. Despite the brilliance in the field of intracellular delivery, the potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and their mimics for designing antifungal agents has been overlooked. In this concept article, we describe the structural design of synthetic antifungal polymers as mimics of host defense peptides, and highlight the effectiveness and potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;inspired strategy in designing potent and selective antifungal polymeric agents. In addition, an outlook for further expanding the design horizons of antifungal polymers is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of urease by hydroquinones: a structural and kinetic study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroquinones are a class of organic compounds abundant in nature which result from the full reduction of the corresponding quinones. Quinones are known to efficiently inhibit urease, a Ni(II)&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonate and acts as a virulence factor of several human pathogens, in addition to decreasing the efficiency of soil organic nitrogen fertilization. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the inhibition of urease from  Sporosarcina pasteurii  (SPU) and  Canavalia ensiformis  (jack bean, JBU) by 1,4&#8208;hydroquinone (HQ) and its methyl&#8208; and  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208; derivatives. The 1.63&#8208;&#197; resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the SPU&#8208;HQ complex discloses that HQ covalently binds to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. Inhibition k inetic data obtained for the three compounds on JBU revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>"Crystal memory" affects the properties of peptide hydrogels &#8208; the case of the cyclic Tyr&#8208;Tyr dipeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work a relationship between the crystal form and morphology and rheological properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels is examined. We show, that under favorable circumstances a correlation between a starting solid material and a self&#8208;assembly processes in solution can exist, leading to different properties of a resulting soft matter. This observation, together with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the influence of stereochemistry of self&#8208;assembled (  ll  ) and (  dl  ) Tyr&#8208;Tyr cyclic dipeptides (cYY) on the observed relationship between gelation and crystallization allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the peptide hydrogelation processes at a molecular level, using liquid state NMR, rheological studies and scanning electron microscopy. In the course of our studies, several crystal forms of (  ll  )&#8208;cYY has been discovered and described in details using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as advanced solid state NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction of powders, thermal analysis, FT&#8208;IR, circular dichroism and crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations. Subsequently, we found that while (  ll  )&#8208;cYY easily assembles into hydrogels with different properties depending on the starting solid form, (  dl  )&#8208;cYY always precipitated as one crystal form in the tested conditions. Molecular&#8208;level justification for this observation is given.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Nucleic Acid Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer&#160;than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Separation by Imide/Imine Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 capture and clean energy production technologies are stirring increasing interest due to the visible effects of global warming on our planet. In the background is a picture of a small lake in Lombardy, Italy, as it appeared in 2018. Novel imide/imine cages have shown promising results in the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. The cages have also been successfully tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. Jansen, M. Carta, V. Amendola et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201631).

         <title>Thiazole Boron Difluoride Dyes with Large Stokes Shift, Solid State Emission and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The small Stokes shift and weak emission in the solid state are two main shortcomings associated with the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) family of dyes. We present herein the design, synthesis and luminescent properties of boron difluoro complexes of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;4&#8208;alkylaminocarbonylthiazoles. &#160;These dyes display&#160; Stokes shifts (&#8710; &#955; ,&#160; 77&#8208;101 nm) with quantum yields (  &#934;  FL  ) up to 64.9 and 34.7% in toluene solution and in solid state, respectively. Some of these compounds exhibit dual fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission properties with modulable phosphorescence quantum yields (  &#934;  PL  ) and lifetime ( &#964;  p  &#160;up to 251&#160; &#956; s). The presence of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and negligible&#160; p &#8208; p &#160;stacking revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure might account for the observed large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission of these fluorophores, while the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of iodine and the self&#8208;assembly driven by halogen bonding,&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; &#160;and C&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#928; &#160;interactions could be responsible for the observed RTP of iodine containing phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Symmetrically &#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazole Incorporating Fluoranthene Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a novel doubly cyclopentannulated carbazole which is accessible through a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of di(1&#8208;naphthylamine). The carbazole moiety is generated in the final step through intramolecular oxidative coupling. The &#960;&#8208;expansion of carbazole resulted in strongly altered optoelectronic and electrochemical properties. The solid&#8208;state structure features an interesting packing motif with alternating face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species via Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Near&#8208;infrared Nanoprobes: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are essential oxidative metabolites of organisms, which are closely related to physiological, pathological and pharmacological processes. The accurate detection of ROS/RNS is important for the understanding of biological processes, monitoring of pharmacological effects, and predicting the course of disease. The recently developed NIR nanoprobes based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) hold great prospects in sensitive and deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS/RNS, and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In this review, we systematically summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances of UCNPs&#8208;based NIR probes for ROS/RNS sensing, and the potential challenges and perspectives for further research are also highlighted. We envision that such a research field will have a bright future for modern biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Approach for Expanding the Three&#8208;Dimensional Space of Tetrahydroquinoline to Develop BET Bromodomain Inhibitors**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF  3  .OEt  2  , which generates a highly electrophilic aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one&#8208;pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a  cis  &#8208;2,3 and  trans  &#8208;3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three&#8208;step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2&#8208;selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti&#8208;inflammatory effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical S  E  Ar mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H / E (E = electrophile) substitution under formal H  +  elimination. Herein, we report a new variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)  3  , is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C  6  F  5  )  3  ) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyano&#173;methane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)  2  , which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the S  E  Ar mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.</dc:description>

         <title>Templated generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor by isomer&#8208;free SPAAC based on azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8208;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8208;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37 &#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2.800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in the aqueous environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes via Intramolecular Chlorine Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of enynes has contributed significantly to the construction of chiral cyclic molecules. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric cyclization involving halopalladation remains an unresolved challenge with the inevitable disturbance of the halide ions. Herein, an intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy is used to accomplish the enantioselective chloropalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This reaction provides a redox&#8208;neutral approach to a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The precisely controlled coordination of palladium with both the in&#8208;situ generated nucleophilic species and the monodentate phosphoramidite ligand is crucial for enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of [FeII(Atrz)3]SO4 and its Analogues Through Accelerated Ageing: New Insights from Small&#8208;Scale Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accelerated ageing reactions that take place between two solid materials on contact in the absence of added solvent have been used to synthesise two spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active 1D coordination polymers and one of their Cu(II) analogues. The hygroscopy of the ligands and the relative humidity of the reaction chamber have been shown to be a particularly important factor in the rate of reaction. Small&#8208;scale reactions between a few individual crystals have allowed observation of deliquescence of the 4&#8208;aminotriazole ligand at high humidity. The metal salt does not dissolve, and the ligand diffuses into the crystal of the metal salt during the reaction. In the case of the Cu analogue, the formation of the product causes the crystal of the metal salt to deform with the formation of pseudocrystals, which have a fibrous structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;modulated Synthesis of Novel &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Efficient Metal&#8208;free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simple synthetic modifications that tune the molecular structures, thereby the properties of the molecules, are of topical interest. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel cationic rosaniline&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (Acetic acid and BF3&#8226;Et2O). The condensation reaction of rosaniline with 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol in acetic acid renders &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP (CMP&#8208;A) while changing the acid to BF3&#8226;Et2O, the linkages transform to enol and undergoes BF2&#8208;complexation, leading to boronil CMP (CMP&#8208;B). BF2&#8208;functionalities in boranil CMP significantly modified the optical and functional properties compared to &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP. The cationic&#8208;delocalization along with the extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization supported by chromophoric BF2&#8208;groups allow CMP&#8208;B to exhibit broad absorption spanning the visible to Near&#8208;Infrared region (NIR). The absorption red&#8208;edge of CMP&#8208;B appears around 1277 nm (optical band gap ~1.58 eV) while CMP&#8208;A displays at 981 nm (optical band gap ~1.83 eV). Most interestingly, as a photocatalyst, CMP&#8208;B catalyzes hydrogen evolution with a superior rate of 252 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 over CMP&#8208;A (100 &#181;mol g&#8208;1). It is about 2.5 times higher performance. The transient photocurrent measurements, electrochemical impedance data, and in&#8208;depth mott&#8208;Schottky analysis demonstrate that the BF2&#8208;group in CMP&#8208;B generates photoinduced charge carriers and their migration towards the active sites for photocatalysis. These polymers show significant photocatalytic H2 generation without any supportive metal co&#8208;catalyst. The BF2 complexed building blocks are a unique class of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution through green and cost&#8208;effective approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Determining Electronic Structure of ZnO Quantum Dots with Different Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure of quantum dots (QDs) including band edges and possible trap states is an important physical property for optoelectronic applications. The reliable determination of the energy levels of QDs remains a big challenge. Herein we employ cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the energy levels of three types of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. Coupled with spectroscopic techniques, it is found that the onset potential of the first reductive wave is likely related to the conduction band edges while the first oxidative wave originates from the trap states. The determined specific energy levels in CV further demonstrates that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies. The present electrochemical method offers a powerful and effective way to determine the energy levels of wide bandgap ZnO QDs, which will boost their device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>New Synthetic Route to Water&#8208;Soluble Prism[5]arene Hosts and Their Molecular Recognition Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prismarene hosts can be prepared by a direct macrocyclization of functionalized naphthalene monomers. Water soluble prismarene hosts H1 and H3 bind to hydrophobic dications in phosphate buffered saline with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for G9. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.







Abstract
We report that the direct macrocyclization of naphthalene monomers bearing ethyl ester functional groups delivers prism[5]arene derivatives, which can be deprotected to yield water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arenes (H1 and H3). 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy showed that dicationic guests bind with the hydrophobic cores buried inside the anisotropic magnetically shielding cavity. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that H1 and H3 are high&#8208;affinity hosts in PBS&#8208;buffered water with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for a select guest. The complexation events are driven by the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and electrostatic interactions. Host H1 displays somewhat higher affinity toward a common guest than pillar[6]arene bearing carboxylic acid functional groups but is significantly less potent than pillar[6]arene bearing sulfate groups. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Amines and a Four&#8208;Armed Cyano&#8208;Substituted Luminophore through Hydrogen Bonds for Potential Development of Smart Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;armed cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene luminophore was synthesized, which can spontaneously co&#8208;assemble with chiral amines through intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds, resulting in characteristic chiroptical properties at both ground state and excited state.







Abstract
Chirality transfer from chiral molecules to assemblies is of vital importance to the design of functional chiral materials. In this work, selective co&#8208;assembly behaviors between chiral molecules and an achiral luminophore, potentially driven by the intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds are reported. Cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene carboxylic acid (TA) served as the luminophore and hydrogen bond donors, which underwent co&#8208;assembly with different chiral amines. It was found that structures of chiral amines affect the chirality transfer and the properties of co&#8208;assemblies due to effects on hydrogen bonds and stacking pattern. Only in specific co&#8208;assemblies, the chiroptical properties occurred at both ground state and excited states based on the emerged Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals, revealing that the chirality was successfully transferred from molecular level to supramolecular level. In addition, accurate quantitative examination of chiral amines was realized by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This work demonstrates the characteristic chirality response and transfer through co&#8208;assembly, providing a potential method to develop smart chiroptical materials.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Labeled Riboswitch Synthesized from a Protected TPA Phosphoramidite Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) has been protected with a light sensitive 2&#8208;NBOM group and connected to a uridine phosphoramidite building block. Spin&#8208;labeled RNA can be obtained from this compound by standard protocols of oligonucleotide synthesis and used for EPR studies after light&#8208;induced deprotection.







Abstract
The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) is an excellent spin label for EPR studies of RNA. Previous synthetic methods, however, are complicated and require special equipment. Herein, we describe a uridine derived phosphoramidite with a photocaged TPA unit attached. The light sensitive 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxymethyl group can be removed in high yield by short irradiation at 365&#8197;nm. Based on this approach, a doubly spin&#8208;labeled 27mer neomycin sensing riboswitch was synthesized and studied by PELDOR. The overall thermal stability of the fold is not much reduced by TPA. In&#8208;line probing nevertheless detected changes in local mobility.

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Cyclic Ketones with Dehydroalanine via H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directing Enamine Catalysis: Straightforward Access to Enantiopure Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct, highly enantioselective organocatalytic alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine via a conjugate addition reaction is reported. The use of a chiral bifunctional primary amine/thiourea catalyst was key to obtain the enantiopure, functionalized (substituted ketone) unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids in good yields and remarkable selectivity. The mechanism of the reactions was explored by mass spectrometry studies.







Abstract
The growing importance of structurally diverse and functionalized enantiomerically pure unnatural amino acids in the design of drugs, including peptides, has stimulated the development of new synthetic methods. This study reports the challenging direct asymmetric alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine derivatives via a conjugate addition reaction for the synthesis of enantiopure ketone&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids. The key to success was the design of a bifunctional primary amine&#8208;thiourea catalyst that combines H&#8208;bond&#8208;directing activation and enamine catalysis. The simultaneous dual activation of the two relatively unreactive partners, confirmed by mass spectrometry studies, results in high reactivity while securing high levels of stereocontrol. A broad substrate scope is accompanied by versatile downstream chemical modifications. The mild reaction conditions and consistently excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;95&#8201;%&#8197;ee in most cases) render this protocol highly practical for the rapid construction of valuable noncanonical enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid building blocks.

In essentially one&#8208;pot, using Ir&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis, tris(arene)&#8208;functionalized cationic [4]helicenes are synthesized with full regioselectivity and enantiospecificity starting from a trivial precursor (17 examples). This poly&#8208;addition of aryl groups improves key optical properties, that is, fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes. Electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signatures are observed up to the far&#8208;red domain, in particular with additional arenes prone to aggregation.

         <title>Terminal N2 Dissociation in [(PNN)Fe(N2)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2) Leads to Local Spin&#8208;State Changes and Augmented Bridging N2 Activation</title>

Small stimulus, big change. Vacuum&#8208;induced reversible dissociation of terminal N2&#8208;units lead to structural and electronic reorganisation resulting in a significant activation of a bridging N2 ligand.







Abstract
Nitrogen fixation at iron centres is a fundamental catalytic step for N2 utilisation, relevant to biological (nitrogenase) and industrial (Haber&#8208;Bosch) processes. This step is coupled with important electronic structure changes which are currently poorly understood. We show here for the first time that terminal dinitrogen dissociation from iron complexes that coordinate N2 in a terminal and bridging fashion leaves the Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe unit intact but significantly enhances the degree of N2 activation (&#916;&#957;&#8776;180&#8197;cm&#8722;1, Raman spectroscopy) through charge redistribution. The transformation proceeds with local spin state change at the iron centre (S=
&#8594;S=3/2). Further dissociation of the bridging N2 can be induced under thermolytic conditions, triggering a disproportionation reaction, from which the tetrahedral (PNN)2Fe could be isolated. This work shows that dinitrogen activation can be induced in the absence of external chemical stimuli such as reducing agents or Lewis acids.

         <title>Controlled Modification of Axial Coordination for Transition&#8208;Metal Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a novel coordination method, axial coordination engineering can be used to regulate the active site of catalysts by using various ligands with chalcogen&#8208;, halogen&#8208;, and nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups. Herein, we summarize the latest advances in the experimental and computational efforts aimed at tuning the axial coordination of SACs, and also present perspectives for the further study of axially coordinated SACs.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in areas such as electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis. Aided by recent advances in the synthetic methodologies of nanomaterials, atomic characterization technologies, and theoretical calculation modeling, various SACs have been prepared for a variety of catalytic reactions. To meet the requirements of SACs with distinctive performance and appreciable selectivity, much research has been carried out to adjust the coordination configuration and electronic properties of SACs. This concept summarizes the latest advances in the experimental and computational efforts aimed at tuning the axial coordination of SACs. Series of atoms, functional groups or even macrocycles are oriented into the atomic metal center, and how this affects the electrocatalytic performance is also reviewed. Finally, this concept presents perspectives for the further precise design, preparation and in&#8208;situ detection of axially coordinated SACs.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Conversion of an Unstable Imine Cage to a Stable Cage with Amide Moieties Towards Selective Receptor for Fluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust cage (C2) and macrocycle (M2) were constructed via the formation of imine&#8208;based analogues (C1/M1) followed by post&#8208;synthesis conversion of imine bonds to amides. The cage C2 exhibited selective fluoride binding over chloride and, it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and oxyanions.







Abstract
Synthesis of robust covalent macrocycles/cages via multiple amide&#8208;bond forming reaction is highly challenging and generally it needs multistep reactions. One&#8208;pot reaction of appropriate di&#8208;/tri&#8208;acyl chloride with a diamine generally results polymers or oligomers instead of discrete architectures. To overcome this limitation, a strategy is reported here using dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction of imine&#8208;based macrocycle and cage upon treatment of a diamine with di&#8208; and tri&#8208;aldehydes respectively, followed by post&#8208;synthesis one&#8208;step conversion of imine bonds to amides to form the desired robust macrocycle and cage containing multiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found to form aggregates in DMSO, the cage was intact without any aggregation. Six amide groups in the confined pocket of the cage made it an ideal receptor for selective binding of fluoride with very high selectivity (&#8764;3
103 fold) over chloride, and it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and other oxyanions.

         <title>Profiling Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Heavy Metal Ions Interaction Using Electrochemical Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new way to look: The effect of glycosaminoglycans structural properties on their interaction with heavy&#8208;metal ions is enigmatic because of the limited accessibility to structurally well&#8208;defined glycans and the absence of suitable analytical techniques. The study shows that electrochemical analyses and surface science tools provide valuable insight into the effect of structural components on heparan sulfate and lead(II), cadmium(II) and mercury(II) ions interactions.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans provides extracellular matrix defense against heavy metals cytotoxicity. Identifying the precise glycan sequences that bind a particular heavy metal ion is a key for understanding those interactions. Here, electrochemical and surface characterization techniques were used to elucidate the relation between the glycans structural motifs, uronic acid stereochemistry, and sulfation regiochemistry to heavy metal ions binding. A divergent strategy was employed to access a small library of structurally well&#8208;defined tetrasaccharides analogs with different sulfation patterns and uronic acid compositions. These tetrasaccharides were electrochemically grafted onto glassy carbon electrodes and their response to heavy metal ions was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Key differences in the binding of Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) were associated with a combination of the uronic acid type and the sulfation pattern.

         <title>Insights on the Lewis Superacid Al(OTeF5)3: Solvent Adducts, Characterization and Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimeric Lewis superacid [Al(OTeF5)3]2 and its solvent adducts are ready to test their strength in terms of fluoride ion affinity. While some of them are still highly reactive, others had too much coordinating solvent and remain stable but comparably unreactive. In here, their preparation, characterization and reactivity are reported in detail.







Abstract
Preparation and characterization of the dimeric Lewis superacid [Al(OTeF5)3]2 and various solvent adducts is presented. The latter range from thermally stable adducts to highly reactive, weakly bound species. DFT calculations on the ligand affinity of these Lewis acids were performed in order to rank their remaining Lewis acidity. An experimental proof of the Lewis acidity is provided by the reaction of solvent&#8208;adducts of Al(OTeF5)3 with [PPh4][SbF6] and OPEt3, respectively. Furthermore, their reactivity towards chloride and pentafluoroorthotellurate salts as well as (CH3)3SiCl and (CH3)3SiF is shown. This includes the formation of the dianion [Al(OTeF5)5]2&#8722;.

         <title>Mechanochemical Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Arylhalides and Organozinc Pivalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical conditions prove useful for many important metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. It was shown that efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling can be realized by using air&#8208;stable and solid organozinc pivalates. Ball&#8208;milling affords a range of (hetero)biaryl compounds in very good yields under ambient conditions on air. A short synthesis of analgetic drug diflunisal was also performed.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling reactions are essential tools in target molecule synthesis. However, the use of highly reactive organometallic reagents limits their applicability. Here, we present a mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and organozinc pivalates that can be carried out under ambient temperature and atmosphere. This operationally simple procedure affords a wide range of biaryl and aryl&#8208;heteroaryl derivatives in high yields and short times. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and can be realized on a synthetically useful scale. Its practical value was demonstrated in the short synthesis of the pharmaceutical diflunisal.

         <title>Gel&#228;nder Molecules with Orthogonal Joints: Synthesis of Macrocyclic Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design for &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architectures is presented with orthogonal joints between axis, rungs, and banister. Following this design concept, two macrocyclic model compounds are synthesized, fully characterized, and separated into room temperature stable enantiomers with the banister helically wrapped around the axis.







Abstract
Orthogonal joints, understood as connections with an angle of 90&#176;, were introduced in the design of the &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; model compounds 1 and 2. The banister, consisting of a conjugated carbazole dimer linked by either 1,3&#8208;butadiyne (2) or a single thiophene (1), wraps around an axis composed of a phthalimide dimer due to the dimensional mismatch of both subunits, which are interconnected by phenylene rungs. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; structure was assembled from a monomer comprising the 1,4&#8208;diaminobenzene rung with one amino substituent as part of a 4&#8208;bromo phthalimide subunit forming the orthogonal junction to the axis, and the other as part of a masked 2&#8208;ethynyl carbazole as orthogonal joint to the banister. The macrocycle was obtained by two sequential homocoupling steps. A first dimerization by a reductive homocoupling assembled the axis, while an oxidative acetylene coupling served as ring&#8208;closing reaction. The formed butadiyne was further derivatized to a thiophene, rendering all carbons of the model compound sp2 hybridized. Both helical structures were fully characterized and chirally resolved. Assignment of the enantiomers was achieved by simulation of chiroptical properties and enantiopure synthesis.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalytic Homologation: Access to Diverse Chiral Trifluoromethyl Organoboron Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic boronic acids and boronates were synthesized from simple feedstocks.







Abstract
A broad range of aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic boronic acids were successfully homologated using trifluorodiazoethane in the presence of BINOL derivatives to provide the corresponding chiral trifluoromethyl containing boronic acid derivatives in high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. The in situ conversion of the chiral transient boronic acids to the corresponding alcohols or &#946;&#8208;CF3 carboxylates are also demonstrated.

Boolean MOF Logic: A switchable metal&#8211;organic framework performs AND logic operation using hydrogen and oxygen gas streams as binary inputs.







Abstract
We present an autonomous, chemical logic gate based on a switchable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite, containing carbon nanoparticles and a Pt catalyst. The switchable MOF composite performs as AND logic gate. Hydrogen and oxygen gas streams serve as binary inputs. Catalytically formed water induces a structural transition (crystal volume expansion) of the MOF, and as a consequence, a detectable drop in conductance of the composite as a &#8216;true&#8217; output only if both gases come in contact with the composite.

         <title>Intrinsic regularity of catalytic cobalt chalcogenides in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery: Theoretical study delivers new insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt chalcogenides CoX2  (X=S, Se, Te) render great performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries based on catalytic capacity to alleviate shuttle effect. Given that S/Se/Te belong to the same main group, the outstanding cycling stability delivered by CoTe2  aroused the curiosity about the uniqueness of CoTe2  and intrinsic laws of cobalt chalcogenide. Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX2  : the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX2  mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe2  are three&#8208;fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process. It is hope the results will facilitate the development of cobalt chalcogenides, especially tellurides as cataytic material in lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In spite of achievement of a lot of Ln&#8208;radical SMMs, how to improve magnetic behavior&#160;of Ln&#8208;radical system&#160;remains challenging. Here, two series of Ln&#8208;radical complexes have successfully been built using an imino nitroxide biradical, namely, [Ln  2  (hfac)  6  (ImPhPyobis)  2  ] (Ln  III  = Gd  1  , Tb  2  , Dy  &#160;  3  ) and [Ln  2  Cu  2  (hfac)  10  (ImPhPyobis)  2  ] (Ln  III  = Gd  4  , Dy  &#160;  5  ; hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate and ImPhPyobis = 5&#8208;(4&#8208;oxypyridinium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208; bis(1'&#8208;oxyl&#8208;4',4',5',5'&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene). For these biradical&#8208;metal complexes, two imino nitroxide biradicals bind two Ln(III) ions via their oxygen atoms coming from 4&#8208;oxypyridinium units to produce a binuclear {Ln  2  O  2  } unit. Those imino nitroxide groups are free for complexes  1  &#8208;  3  , however one of imino nitroxide groups of the biradical is ligated to the copper(II) ion for complexes  4  and  5  . The distinct magnetic relaxation behaviors are observed for two Dy derivatives, as revealed by ac magnetic studies: complex  3  presents one magnetic process with the effective energy barrier(  U  eff  ) of 74.0K while complex  5  exhibits dual relaxation processes with  U  eff  values for the fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;relaxation being 20.2K and 30.9K, respectively, which implies that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a critical role for magnetic relaxation.</dc:description>

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes Under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reacting the t Bu PNNP expanded pincer ligand with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh 3 ) 3 (CO) at 140 &#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO) 2 ] ( 1 ) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KO t Bu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;O t Bu)(CO) 2 ] ( 3 ) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reacting the t Bu PNNP expanded pincer ligand with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh 3 ) 3 (CO) at 140 &#176;C produces an insoluble air-stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP)H(&#956;-H)Cl(&#956;-Cl)(CO) 2 ] ( 1 ) using solid-state NMR, IR and X-ray absorption spectroscopies and follow-up reactivity. A reaction with KO t Bu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP*)H(&#956;-H)(&#956;-O t Bu)(CO) 2 ] ( 3 ) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core.

         <title>Sequential formation of heteroternary CB[10] complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The globular and monocationic guest molecule trimethyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane (  AZAP  , a protonated Verkade superbase) was shown to form a host:guest 1:1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water. Molecular dynamics calculations showed that CB[10] adopts an 8&#8208;shape with  AZAP  occupying the majority of the internal space, CB[10] contracting around  AZAP  and leaving a significant part of the cavity unoccupied. This residual space was used to co&#8208;include planar and monocationic coguest (  CG  ) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8226;  AZAP  &#8226;  CG  complexes potentially opening new perspectives in supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;based Aerogels catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide, the most widely distributed carbon source in nature, has been widely investigated for its reduction and reuse. In this field, nanometallic materials have been widely studied because of their excellent photo/electrocatalytic activity. As one of the nanometallic materials, metal aerogel has the unique advantages of high electron transfer rate and large specific surface area, as well as rich pore space and strong adsorption performance, which makes it a highly researched material for catalytic CO  2  reduction in recent years. In this paper, we firstly report the latest preparation methods of metal aerogels and the recent progress in electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction. After that, the properties of several typical metallic aerogels and their latest applications in electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction are described. Finally, the vision and research directions for the future industrialization of metal aerogels for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction are proposed from the perspective of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Conductive/Insulating Bi&#8208;functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients&#160;and high safety. However, the dendrite growth and side reactions occur in Zn anode, which lead to the exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and the poor cycling&#8208;stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anode.  The porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as conductive layer effectively reduces nuclear barrier and contains Zn  2+  deposition in a certain space.  Polyimide  (PI) coatings using as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn  2+  , which could reduce the differential&#8208;concentration on the Zn surface and induce the uniform deposition of Zn  2+  . Therefore, the CIBL&#8208;Zn//CIBL&#8208;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300 hours at 1  mA cm  &#8208;2  . The CE of CIBL&#8208;Zn//CIBL&#8208;Zn battery maintains at 99.2% even after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the CIBL&#8208;Zn//V  2  O  5  battery exhibits a capacity of nearly 289.2 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  after 3000 cycles and no sign of capacity degradation is found, which further demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Photocatalyzed Dearomative Hydroacylation of Indoles: Direct Synthesis of 2&#8208;Acylindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;A POM out of the blue&#8221;. Decatungstate anion photocatalyzed a mild dearomatization of indoles to access 2&#8208;acylindolines via direct hydrogen atom transfer under purple&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
We report herein a convenient and scalable dearomative hydroacylation reaction of indoles. Employing readily available aldehydes as the acyl source and TBADT as an inexpensive direct HAT photocatalyst, a variety of indoles derivatives were converted into synthetically interesting 2&#8208;acylindolines in good to excellent yields as well as great diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. An asymmetric version of the reaction was successfully developed and an experimental mechanistic investigation was carried out in order to gain further insights on the assumed reaction pathway.

         <title>Branched Tertiary Amines from Aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;Olefins by Combined Multiphase Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of olefins to branched amines is presented by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that each can be recycled 9 times. The product phase of the first system is the substrate phase for the second recycling. The yields are stable during those recycling runs and the leaching is low with 0.09&#8201;% over the two recycling stages.







Abstract
This study presents the transformation of olefins to branched amines by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that can be recycled 9 times. The products are branched amines that are precursors for surfactants. Since the multiphase hydrofomylation/aldol condensation system has already been studied, the first step was to develop the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes together with a subsequent reductive amination. The rhodium/phosphine catalyst is immobilized in a polar polyethylene phase which separates from the product phase after the reaction. Reaction and catalyst recycling are demonstrated by the conversion of the C14&#8208;aldehyde 2&#8208;pentylnonenal with the dimethylamine surrogate dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate to the corresponding tertiary amine with yields up to 88&#8201;% and an average rhodium leaching of less than 0.1&#8201;% per recycling run.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents the transformation of olefins to branched amines by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that can be recycled 9 times. The products are branched amines that are precursors for surfactants. Since the multiphase hydrofomylation/aldol condensation system has already been studied, the first step was to develop the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes together with a subsequent reductive amination. The rhodium/phosphine catalyst is immobilized in a polar polyethylene phase which separates from the product phase after the reaction. Reaction and catalyst recycling are demonstrated by the conversion of the C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;-aldehyde 2-pentylnonenal with the dimethylamine surrogate dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate to the corresponding tertiary amine with yields up to 88&#8201;% and an average rhodium leaching of less than 0.1&#8201;% per recycling run. Furthermore, the positive influence of a Bronsted acid and carbon monoxide on the selectivity are discussed. Finally, the two PEG based systems have been merged in one recycling approach, by using the product phase of the hydroformylation aldol condensation reaction for the reductive amination reaction. The yields are stable during a nine recycling runs and the leaching low with 0.09&#8201;% over the two recycling stages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Emissive, Chiroptical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double [7] Helicenes through Embedded Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the photophysics of double helicenes is facilely achieved by variation of the terminal aromatic rings. Compared to the thiadiazole&#8208;fused and all&#8208;carbon analogs, triazole&#8208;fused double helicene shows significantly enhanced emission with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, and high circularly polarized luminescence brightness of up to 30.1&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, as well as excellent ambipolar redox behavior.







Abstract
We present here the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physicochemical characterization of a double hetero[7]helicene fused with four triazole rings at both helical ends. The comparison of this triazole&#8208;fused double helicene with the previously reported all&#8208;carbon and thiadiazole&#8208;fused analogs revealed the huge impact of the embedded aromatic rings on the photophysical features. The small structural variation of the terminal rings from thiadiazole to triazole caused a dramatic change of the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) from &lt;1&#8201;% to 96&#8201;%, while the replacement of the terminal benzene rings with triazole rings induced a tenfold enhancement of the circularly polarized luminescence dissymmetry factor. These observations were well corroborated with transient absorption analysis and/or theoretic calculations. In addition, the triazole&#8208;fused double helicene exhibited ambipolar redox behavior, enabling the generation of radical cation and anion species by electrochemical and chemical methods and showing its potential for spin&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Monomeric Magnesium Catalyzed Alkene and Alkyne Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric magnesium methyl complex has been employed for alkene and alkyne hydroboration. The methodology has been extended towards terpenes. A detailed theoretical calculation has been provided to understand the mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, two monomeric magnesium alkyl complexes (1 and 2) were prepared using bis(phosphino)carbazole framework and among them 1 has been used as a catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes with pinacolborane (HBpin). A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes were efficiently reduced. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes was achieved, which was confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments. The work represents the first example of the use of magnesium in homogeneous catalytic hydroboration of alkene with broad substrate scope. Experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism. Finally, the hydroboration protocol was extended to terpenes.

         <title>A Chemically Fuelled Molecular Automaton Displaying Programmed Migration of Zn2+ Between Alternative Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed autonomous migration of cations between alternative binding sites of a peptidomimetic ligand is driven by a fuelled change in acidity of the system. The rate of migration, and delays or resets in the execution of the program, may be controlled by the operating conditions of the molecular automaton.







Abstract
A molecular system comprising a cationic zinc complex and an amino acid&#8208;derived ambident ligand having phosphate and carboxylate binding sites undergoes a series of rearrangements in which the metal cation migrates autonomously from one site to another. The location of the metal is identified by the circular dichroism spectrum of a ligated bis(2&#8208;quinolylmethyl)&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BQPA) chromophore, which takes a characteristic shape at each binding site. Migration is fuelled by the decomposition of trichloroacetic acid to CO2 and CHCl3, which progressively neutralises the acidity of the system as a function of time, revealing in sequence binding sites of increasing basicity. The migration rate responds to control by variation of the temperature, water content and triethylamine concentration, while an excess of fuel controls the duration of an induction period before the migration event.

         <title>Structural insights into the very low activity of the homocoenzyme B12 adenosylmethylcobalamin in coenzyme B12&#8208;dependent diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The X&#8208;ray structures of coenzyme B  12  (AdoCbl)&#8208;dependent eliminating isomerases complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) were determined. As judged from geometries, its Co&#8208;C bond in diol dehydratase (DD) is not activated even in the presence of substrate. In ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL), the bond is elongated in the absence of substrate, and in the presence of substrate, the complex likely exists in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;homolysis states. The impacts of incorporation of an extra CH  2  group are different in the two enzymes: The DD active site is flexible and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that make DD unable to adopt the catalytic state, whereas the EAL active site is rigid and AdoMeCbl binding does not induce significant conformational changes. Such flexibility and rigidity of the active sites may reflect the tightness of adenine binding. The structures provide good insights into the basis of the very low activity of AdoMeCbl in these enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiluminescent Imaging Assay of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein with Target&#8208;Induced Enzyme Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simple but robust testing assays are essential for screening and diagnosis of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) in COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here,  we described  a  chemiluminescent imaging assay  (  CLIA  ) for  sensitive and convenient  detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy.  The T&#8208;EAR used a pair of antibody&#8208;DNA probes to recognize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP and proximity&#8208;induced rolling circle amplification for mass&#8208;production of pyrophosphate to coordinate with Cu  2+  , which prevented the reduction of Cu  2+  to Cu  +  by sodium ascorbate as well as the Cu  +  &#8208;caused inactivation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP).  The activity retention of HRP produced strong CL signal for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by H  2  O  2  . The  T&#8208;EAR based  CLIA  showed a wide detection range from 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL&#160;  (13 fM to 1.3 nM)  with the requirement of only 0.75 &#956;L of sample.  This CLIA had advantages of good sensitivity, simple  wash&#8208;free  operation, acceptable accuracy, and  high&#8208;throughput imaging detection  , displaying potential applicability in  screening assay of COVID&#8208;19 infection  .</dc:description>

         <title>Dual MOF&#8208;derived MoS2/CdS Photocatalysts with Rich Sulfur Vacancies for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coctalyst&#160;plays an important role in efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis. Herein,a MoS  2  /CdS photocatalyst with MoS  2  as cocatalyst was designed by using Mo&#8208;MOF and Cd&#8208;MOF as precursors. Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase,&#160;MoS  2  shows strong charge capture and transport ability.&#160;The photo&#8208;generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bounded by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS  2  through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large&#8208;scale MoS  2  .The optimal photocatalyst 1%MoS  2  /CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity,&#160;which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt.&#160;This work highlights the role of Mo&#8208;MOF derived MoS  2  with 1T&#8208;2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS  2  /CdS composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar Driven Gas Phase Advanced Oxidation Processes for Methane Removal &#8211; Challenges and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane (CH  4  ) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH  4  emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5  o  C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH  4  emissions by developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH  4  (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH  4  removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerization, Stimuli&#8208;induced Depolymerization, and Precipitation&#8208;driven Macrocyclization in a Nitroaldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Dynamic covalent polymers of different topology have been synthesized from an aromatic dialdehyde and &#945;,&#969;dinitroalkanes via the nitroaldol reaction. All dinitroalkanes yielded dynamers with the dialdehyde, where the length of the dinitroalkane chain played a vital role in determining the structure of the final products. For longer dinitroalkanes, linear dynamers were produced, where the degree of polymerization reached a plateau at higher feed concentrations. In the reactions involving 1,4&#8208;dinitrobutane and 1,5dinitropentane, specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization of the linear chains, further driven by precipitation. At lower temperature, the same systemic self&#8208;sorting effect was also observed for the 1,6&#8208;dinitrohexane&#8208;based dynamers. Moreover, the dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine bioconjugation serves as a powerful tool in biological research and has been widely used for the chemical modification of proteins, constructing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and enabling cell imaging studies. Cysteine conjugation reactions with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity have been under heavy pursuit as they would allow clean protein modification with just stoichiometric amount of reagents, which minimizes side reaction, simplifies purification and broadens the functional group tolerance. In this concept, we summarize the recent advances of fast cysteine bioconjugation, and discuss the mechanism and chemical principles that underlie the high efficiencies of the newly developed cysteine reactive reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of a Dinuclear Platinum(II) Compound: Mechanism and Roles of an Upper Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dinuclear Pt(II) compound was reported to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF); however, the luminescence mechanism remains elusive. To reveal relevant excited&#8208;state properties and luminescence mechanism of this Pt(II) compound, both density function theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out in this work. In terms of the results, the S  1  and T  2  states show mixed inter&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT)/metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand CT (MLCT) characters while the T  1  state exhibits mixed ILCT/ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal CT (LMCT) characters. Mechanistically, a four&#8208;state (S  0  , S  1  , T  1  , and T  2  ) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior. The reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process from the initial T  1  to final S  1  states involves two up&#8208;conversion channels (  direct T  1  &#8594;S  1  and T  2  &#8208;mediated T  1  &#8594;  T  2  &#8594;  S  1  pathways) and both play crucial roles in TADF. At 300 K, these two channels are much faster than the T  1&#160;  phosphorescence emission enabling TADF. However, at 80 K, these rISC rates are reduced by several orders of magnitude and become very small, which blocks the TADF emission; instead, only the phosphorescence is observed. These findings rationalize the experimental observation and could provide useful guidance to rational design of organometallic materials with superior TADF performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Dipole and Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interaction Manipulation Synergistically Enhance Intrinsic Antibacterial Activities of AIEgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathogenic bacteria infections, especially multidrug resistant bacteria infections have aroused worldwide attention due to their severe threats to human beings. Thus, the development of highly effective antibacterial reagents is very important but still quite challenging for the lack of a universal design strategy. Here, a synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;  +  interaction was proposed for constructing highly efficient antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature. Firstly, four anion&#8208;&#960;  +  &#8208;type AIE luminogens were designed and synthesized. Due to the electron&#8208;donating and hydrophilic characteristic of methoxy groups, 3MOTPO containing three methoxy groups showed the largest dipole moment (5.06 Debey) and dual anion&#8208;&#960;  +  interactions in the solid state. Driven by both dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;  +  interactions, 3MOTPO showed the strongest bacterial binding ability and the best antibacterial activities (MIC  90  = 3.76 &#956;M). The work offers a deep insight into the rational design of highly efficient antimicrobials for luminescence&#8208;guided antibacterial study.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Vesicles for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular vesicles (SMVs) self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of two scaffolds linked together through noncovalent interactions, can realize stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release of encapsulated drugs for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized side effect of drugs. Pillararenes (PAs), an emerging kind of macrocyclic hosts in 2008, are easy to modify with a variety of functionalities. SMVs from PAs and specific guests mainly based on the host&#8211;guest interactions have attracted increasing attention because of their drug delivery and controlled drug release. A great progress in the construction and stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery of the PA&#8208;based SMVs has been made since the first work was reported in 2012. This review summarizes the major achievements of the PA&#8208;based SMVs for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery over the past 5 years, including the microstructures of SMVs, multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive SMVs, prodrug SMVs from prodrug PAs and guests, bola&#8208;type SMVs, multifunctional SMVs, glucose&#8208;responsive SMVs for insulin delivery, novel SMVs from responsive PAs, thermo&#8208;responsive SMVs, and ternary SMVs, for chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and other biological applications. The future challenges and research directions of PA&#8208;based SMVs are also outlined from the points of views of the fundamental research, biological applications, and clinical applications of PA&#8208;based SMVs.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Recognition with Sb(III) and Bi(III) Triaryl&#8208;Based Pnictogen Bonding Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterisation of a library of acyclic Sb(III) and Bi(III) triaryl pnictogen bonding (PnB) receptor systems are reported. In the first&#8208;generation receptor series, quantitative  1  H NMR chloride titration experiments in THF solvent media reveal that halide anion binding potency is intimately correlated with both the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl&#8208; substituent and the polarisability of the PnB donor. Further extensive anion binding investigations with the most potent Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;based PnB receptors  :  1&#183;Sb  2CF3  and  1&#183;Bi  2CF3  , reveal novel selectivity profiles, both displaying Cl  &#8208;  selectivity relative to the heavier halides and, impressively, to a range of highly basic oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding studies of a series of novel tripodal tris&#8208;proto&#8208;triazole triaryl Sb(III) and Bi(III) mixed PnB&#8208;HB receptor systems are also described. Whereas parent triphenyl Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds are incapable of binding Cl  &#8208;  in THF solvent media, the PnB&#8208;triazole HB host systems exhibit notable halide affinity</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Performance through the Construction of a Supramolecular Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst, named TM&#8208;SOF, is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[8]uril and a tetra&#8208;arm monomer containing four N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridinium)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (MPT) moieties. Benefiting from the multi&#8208;valent assembly, the photocatalytically active supramolecular MPT dimer, can be stably formed in TM&#8208;SOF. In addition, TM&#8208;SOF exhibits better stability against temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, the TM&#8208;SOF shows a significantly improved performance for the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of aryl boronic acid and thioether. It is highly anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile approach for fabricating high&#8208;performance supramolecular photocatalysis systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Aromatic Foldamer Helices using Acridine Appendages and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folded molecules provide complex interaction interfaces amenable to sophisticated self&#8208;assembly motifs. Because of their high conformational stability, aromatic foldamers constitute suitable candidates for the rational elaboration of self&#8208;assembled architectures. Several multiturn helical aromatic oligoamides have been synthesized that possess arrays of acridine appendages pointing in one or two directions. The acridine units were shown to direct self&#8208;assembly in the solid state via aromatic stacking leading to recurrent helix&#8208;helix association patterns under the form of discrete dimers or of extended arrays. In the presence of Pd(II), metal coordination of the acridine units overwhelms other forces and generates new metal&#8208;mediated multihelical self&#8208;assemblies, including macrocyles. These observations demonstrate simple access to different types of foldamer&#8208;containing architectures, ranging from discrete objects to 1D and, by extension, 2D and 3D arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks based Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered as the next&#8208;generation energy technology owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of Li anodes result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency. Various materials have been applied to promote the electrochemical performance of LOBs. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porous structures, open active sites and adjustable pore sizes are attempted as promising materials for catalysts and separators of LOBs. This concept presents an overview of different MOF&#8208;based catalysts for LOBs, including traditional, conductive, semi&#8208;conductive and soluble MOFs, as well as our recently proposed photoinvolved LOBs. Recent advances on the MOF&#8208;based separators have also been discussed to restrain the shuttling of redox mediators between cathodes and anodes and suppress formation of lithium dendrites. Perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs are presented for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;based photochromic delivery vehicles for ions and small molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular switches have been used as delivery vehicles for various species. The ones that reversibly operate with light are arguably the best candidates for the purpose as they can be operated using light. The two states of these photoswitchable systems often possess remarkable differences in terms of their structural features and electronic properties. Photochromic systems with the appropriate embellishment of functionalities at suitable positions have thus been used as photoresponsive receptors. The use of light&#8208;driven alterations of the structural features has led to differential molecular recognition with these switchable host molecules. In this article, we discuss the use of such supramolecular systems as the delivery vehicles for ions and molecules that started with the pioneering work by Shinkai back in 1979. This review will explicitly cover the development from 2001 to 2022 with some past background and the future prospect of the field</dc:description>

         <title>High performance Bifunctional Electrocatalysts  Designed  Based on Transition Metal Sulfides for Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the energy crisis by the excessive consumption of fossil fuels,   Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs)  with high theoretical energy density have attracted people's attention.  The overall performance of ZABs is largely determined by the air cathode catalyst  . Therefore, it is necessary to develop high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalysts to replace noble metal catalysts to promote the development of ZABs. Among a variety of cathode catalysts, TMS has become a research hotspot in recent years because of its better electrical conductivity than metal phosphides and metal oxides. In this work, we focus on the means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of  transition metal sulfides (TMS)  providing ideas for us to rationally design high&#8208;performance catalysts. Furthermore, the performance improvement law between catalyst performance and ZABs is also discussed in this work. Finally, some challenges and opportunities faced in the research of TMS electrocatalysis are briefly proposed, and strategies for improving the performance of ZABs are prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;5&#8208;Acyl Stabilization of Uronic Acid Glycosyl Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uronic acids are carbohydrates carrying a terminal carboxylic acid and have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Here, we study the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylate ester or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS has revealed that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, where the mixture is driven towards the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;5 dioxolanium ion when the C&#8208;5,C&#8208;2&#8208;relationship is  cis  and towards the formation of the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is  trans  . Isomer population analysis and interconversion barrier computations showed that the two conformations were not in dynamic equilibrium and that the ratio paralleled the density functional theory computed stability of the conformers. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing a Pentacyclic Fragment&#8208;Based Library Derived from Perophoramidine: Their Design, Synthesis and Evaluation as Anticancer Compounds via DNA Double&#8208;Strand Breaks (DSB) and PARP&#8208;1 Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we have reported the discovery of a pentacyclic building block comprised of fused indole&#8208;quinoline and piperidinone from the natural product perophoramidine as a formidable anticancer agent. The compounds were synthesized in six steps where the key steps involved a blue LED mediated intramolecular cyclopropanation of the indole intermediates and concomitant reduction of the associated aryl nitro moiety to nitroso in the molecule. Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells  i.e  ., MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9 microM IC  50  s by few of the compounds. gammaH2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti&#8208;g&#8208;H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone&#8208;coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP&#8208;1 inhibition with IC  50  s of 1.3 to&#160;1.5 microM.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;efficient Ultrathin PdCuMo Porous Nanosheets with Abundant Defects for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To reduce the over&#8208;dependence on Pt, Pd&#8208;based catalysts have become one of the most effective candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In order to further accelerate the ORR kinetics and strengthen the catalytic performance of Pd catalyst, component optimization and morphology design are adopted to achieve these goals. Although great progress has been made, it is still difficult to obtain porous ultrathin nanosheets with excellent performance by a simple method. Here, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets (PdCuMo NSs) were successfully prepared. This structure possessed a large specific surface area with rich cavities and structural defects, significantly enhancing its ORR performance. In special, the mass activity of PdCuMo NSs was 1.46 A mg  &#8208;1  at 0.90 V, which&#160;was 12.2, &#160; 8.6, 2.7 times as high as that of Pd/C, Pt/C and PdCuMo nanoparticles (PdCuMo NPs), respectively. In addition, it had an excellent ability to resist CO poisoning and exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study the ultrafast photoactivated dynamics of the hydrogen bonded dimer Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in chloroform solution, focusing on the population of the Guanine [[EQUATION]] Cytosine charge transfer state (GC&#8208;CT), an important elementary process for the photophysics and photochemistry of nucleic acids. We integrate a quantum dynamics propagation scheme, based on a linear vibronic model parameterized through time dependent density functional theory calculations, with four different solvation models, either implicit or explicit. On average,
after 50 fs, 30 [[EQUATION]] 40% of the bright excited state population
has been transferred to GC&#8208;CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC&#8208;CT is however disfavored in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical&#8208;physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time&#8208;scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.</dc:description>

after 50 fs, 30 [[EQUATION]] 40% of the bright excited state population
has been transferred to GC-CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC-CT is however disfavored in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical-physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time-scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
